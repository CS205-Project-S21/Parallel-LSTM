This is a note after playing with 10 news API recommended from https://rapidapi.com/blog/rapidapi-featured-news-apis/

**What we want:** Simplicity and user-friendly (with Python client), Support key-word search (for stock-related news), Provide news date (for integration with time series stock price data), Free (at least for several hundred requests per day), Great if provide full text/short excerpt (for accurate sentiment analysis).

**Conclusion:**

#### 1. Bing News Search
See `BingNewsAPI.ipynb`. One fatal defect is, this API does not support search by explicit date range, only freshness. Otherwise, it has good info structure with a short description text.
