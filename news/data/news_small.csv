Some products in our articles are from partners who may provide us with compensation, but this doesnt change our opinions. In 2008, Bitcoin became the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since then, widespread adoption and acceptance have been slow. But in 2021, the currency is legitimate as a payment method and an investment. But while many people arent concerned about converting their cash into Bitcoin, others may feel more reluctant. Whether youre all-in on Bitcoin or youre intrigued, but dont necessarily want to use your own money to invest, here are some ways you can earn the cryptocurrency with your everyday spending without changing much about your habits. 3 Ways to Earn Bitcoin Every Day Cash-back rewards have been around for a long time, but the chance to earn Bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular. If youre interested in earning cryptocurrency instead of points, miles or cash back on your everyday shopping, heres how you can do it. Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card In early 2021, BlockFi launched the worlds first credit card that offers cryptocurrency instead of more traditional forms of credit card rewards. The BlockFi Bitcoin Rewards Credit Cardoffers 1.5% back on every purchase you make in the form of Bitcoin. Youll also earn $250 worth of Bitcoin after you spend $3,000 in the first three months, along with 3.5% Bitcoin rewards on all purchases during the first four to six months from account opening. Each month, the rewards you earned from the previous month will be added to your BlockFi Interest Account which offers up to 8.6% APY. The only drawback is that the card charges a $200 annual fee. In other words, it may be better for Bitcoin enthusiasts than for people who are just looking to dip their toes into the water. Read our full reviewof BlockFi. Bitcoin Debit Cards While theres only one Bitcoin-powered credit card, there are several debit cards that offer the cryptocurrency as a reward every time you swipe. While some charge fees, there are low and even no-fee cards available. Some of the options include: Story continues BlockCard : You can earn up to 6.38% back, depending on how much TERN you stake. You can then exchange your TERN for Bitcoin. It charges a $5 monthly fee, but that fee is waived if you spend more than $750 on the card every month.",https://sports.yahoo.com/earn-bitcoin-everyday-spending-192224464.html,1

That's because this cryptocurrency is rapidly making it into the mainstream. In the past,","Apr 15, 2021 Share Bitcoins impact on the global economy is an emerging trend. Thats because this cryptocurrency is rapidly making it into the mainstream. In the past, only a few people know about Bitcoin. Many people saw the success of this digital currency as a pipe dream. To others, Bitcoin was an obscure hobby. But, this has changed after some years. Today, Bitcoins story is entirely different. Bitcoin presents a significant digital investment opportunity. And this cryptocurrency has the potential to impact the world severely. The Bitcoin price increase to around $4,764.8 in August 2017 from around $572.3 in August 2016 increased this cryptocurrencys popularity. It also captured many investors attention globally. Whats more, Bitcoin makes up to around 64.01% of the overall cryptocurrencies value. Over 7.1 million people are active users of this cryptocurrency. Currently, many people use platforms like Bitcoin Code to purchase and sell this digital currency for profits. Such an app optimizes the users crypto trading process, thereby reducing the risk of missing out on trading opportunities. It also saves time when trading cryptocurrency. Perhaps, you can visit the profit bitcoin app page to register and start purchasing and selling this digital currency. Essentially, Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to transform the traditional financial system. The goal was also to eliminate financial intermediaries. And this is likely to have substantial effects on the global economy. Bitcoin can also act as a safe-haven asset. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a worldwide financial system. Investors, banking sectors, companies, and governments have shown real-time interest in this cryptocurrency. Digging Through the Bitcoin Concept Bitcoin exhibits properties that traditional currencies or authorized money and assets like gold dont have. And these properties give this cryptocurrency the power to impact the global economy. For a long time, people have called Bitcoin a digital currency. And this is for a reason. Essentially, Bitcoin could be the game-changer at the global financial level and a tool that may enhance economic growth. Heres why: Value Storage: Bitcoin exists as digital money. That means its not available in a physical form or shape like cash. As such, people can store Bitcoin in digital wallets. Individuals can use the seed phrase they use to access this cryptocurrency from devices like tablets and phones. Thus, people can use Bitcoin to store value safely. Security: Bitcoin is a digital currency without a central controlling authority. As such, it eliminates fraud risk. With Bitcoin, people complete real-time transactions safely from their devices. Whats more, the absence of intermediaries enables Bitcoin users to control and manage their assets. Anonymity: You dont have to connect the Bitcoins in your digital wallet to explicitly distinguishing information. Thus, this currency is different from traditional banks that demand to know their customers purposes and intents by requesting financial and personal data for every transaction. Payment method: Bitcoin is both a new form of money and a digital currency. That means people can use it to transfer and receive money. Currently, many businesses access Bitcoin payments. With such attributes, Bitcoin has the potential to impact the global economy in many ways. Here are some of the ways this cryptocurrency is likely to affect this economy. Shifting global investments from traditional assets to digital assets like Bitcoin Separating transactions from the U.S dollar that has for long served as the reserve currency Eliminating the essence of the intermediaries like banks Encouraging more online and overseas transactions Reducing over-reliance on fiat currencies Removing barriers to business entry and emerging markets Opening access to the credit system in countries with inadequate banking systems Overall, many people and institutions will feel the impact of Bitcoin on the global economy. And this explains why many entities are rushing to adopt Bitcoin as a payment method, trading asset, and investment asset.",https://tribuneonlineng.com/bitcoin-impact-on-the-global-economy/,1
ndtv,NotProvided,2021-04-15 12:47:35,"Heath Streak, Banned For 8 Years, Was Paid In Bitcoins By Bookie: ICC",The Heath Streak corruption case has thrown up the use of cryptocurrency by bookies.,"Heath Streak has been banned for eight years by the ICC for breaching their anti-corruption code.  AFP Former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak's shocking admission of cricket corruption has also shone a light on cryptocurrency finding a place in the bookies' list of enticements -- a brand new challenge for the ICC's Anti-Corruption Unit, which claims to be ready for the battle. Streak was on Wednesday banned by the ICC for eight years after admitting to disclose inside information to a suspected Indian bookie during his coaching stints in Zimbabwe, Bangladesh as well as the IPL, Afghanistan Premier League and the Bangladesh Premier League. Till date, cash has been the most preferred mode of payment for bookies, who also pay in kind with cars, jewellery and high-end phones. However, Streak's case has thrown up the use of bitcoin in corrupt payments. The ICC's detailed judgement in the case has revealed that Streak once received two ""bitcoins"" from a corruptor in 2018, valued at $35,000 at that time. ""It is a new phenomenon for us, but we have staff capable of investigating it. Corrupters try to use all modes including cash and 'hawala', which are not easy to trace either. Bitcoins pose a similar challenge,"" ICC ACU General Manager Alex Marshall said in an email reply to PTI's query on Thursday. So what is cryptocurrency? In layman's language, ""Cryptocurrency"" is virtual money. It is the purchase of a digital asset based on an algorithm. The bitcoins that are generated aren't regulated by any central banking authority in any country (like the Reserve Bank of India) and in many countries like India, it is still an illegal tender. In simpler words, it is a ""Blockchain Industry"" where a financial transaction between two people sitting in two different parts of the world will not have any intermediaries. The valuation of one bitcoin is staggering. One bitcoin's INR value currently stands at Rs 46.83 lakh or $62,453. However, the bigger challenge is that coding of ""cryptocurrency"" is believed to be watertight. There are elaborately programmed vaults (digital) and the tracking can be infinitely more difficult when compared to paper tenders like INR, USD or GBP. Marshall said that ICC is up for the challenge in the coming days now that a new method of corruption has emerged. ""Tracking bitcoin transactions may not be easy but we have the right people with the right expertise, understanding and network needed to ensure we stay ahead of the corruptors,"" Marshall said. Even BCCI's new head of Anti Corruption Unit (ACU) Shabbir Hussain Shekhadam Khandwawala said that he heard of payment through bitcoins for the first time. ""Yes, I was going through the details of the Heath Streak case. I have also heard about bitcoin transaction for the first time,"" the former DGP of Gujarat Police told PTI. However, Hussain feels that tracking of corrupt people is not always about the keeping a vigil on the mode of transactions. ""We always catch the people not by the amount or how the money is paid (bitcoins in this case). Our clues are different. We keep a watch on them and their activities and telephonic calls,"" Hussain said. ""Some things happen underground also,"" he said, adding ""Everything has to be on the basis of the solid information received from sources. ""So if someone has accepted money or been involved in graft in any form, once you start investigation, you are able to reach that,"" he said. He, in fact, played down the prospect of cryptocurrency gaining ground in the world of cricket corruption.

On the menu today: Coinbases crypto correlation, another tech IPO, consumer borrowing stalls, and a look back at the Bitcoin white paper. To sign up for the Capital Note, follow this link. Coinbase: A Bet on Crypto? The basic value proposition of Bitcoin and similar digital currencies is: They are not controlled by a centralized, trusted authority, so crypto transactions are immutable and open to anyone. They cant be devalued by a central bank or some other government entity. Which is awkward for Coinbase, a centralized corporation that listed on the Nasdaq yesterday with the blessing of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The exchanges $60-some billion valuation is a result of a fantastically profitable exercise in centralizing decentralized assets. Coinbase makes money because its users trust it to buy and store their Bitcoin in the same way that a depositor trusts Chase to hold his money (although the latter has the advantage of federal deposit insurance). The Coinbase listing is the apotheosis of the past years much-heralded institutional adoption of crypto  PayPal and Mastercard adding Bitcoin to their offerings, Tesla adding it to its balance sheet. While many see the Coinbase listing as a vindication of crypto, it underscores a paradox: Bitcoin, devised as a tool to emancipate the masses from corporate and state power, now depends on the imprimatur of the institutions it is meant to take down. If Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin as an alternative to the corporate financial system, Wall Streets embrace of a crypto exchange should be a damning rebuke of the currencys raison detre. And Coinbase joining the ranks of Tesla and SPACs in stock-market hype cuts against the austere, Austrian economic philosophy of most of its proponents. Theres also the question of competition. Coinbase gets away with charging gargantuan fees because there are few alternatives. As Matt Levine points out, the trading volume on Coinbase is miniscule by Wall Streets standards: Coinbase users have traded about $456 billion of cryptocurrencies, or a bit less than people trade on an average single day in the U.S. stock market. $90 Billion Assets on Platform, boasts Coinbase; it also notes that that represents about 11.1% of the total value of all crypto assets. Goldman Sachss earnings presentation notes that it has about $2.2 trillion of assets under supervision just in its asset management division; JPMorgans earnings supplement notes that it has almost $3.7 trillion of assets on its balance sheet. Coinbase makes far more per transaction than Goldman could ever hope to. Increased institutional adoption means more competition for Coinbase from platforms that will undercut its margins. Good for crypto, bad for Coinbase. It is unsurprising, then, that Bitcoins dollar value dropped yesterday as Coinbase shares rallied. MicroStrategy, a stock that has effectively become a Bitcoin proxy, lost 16 percent, too. That decline is due in large part to an increase in the supply of publicly listed Bitcoin proxies. If you were getting exposure to Bitcoin by owning MicroStrategy shares, now there are 186 million shares of Coinbase that offer directionally similar exposure. What all this says is that Bitcoin might not be the asset its evangelists claim it is or want it to be. Not a currency that will topple the state, but a consumer product that people like to gamble on, more akin to DraftKings than digital gold. If so, Coinbases valuation may be justified. But if Bitcoin is still what Satoshi envisioned, institutional adoption should worry the HODLers. Around the Web Another big IPO this week, KKR-backed AppLovin, got less love from investors Shares in AppLovin, the mobile games company that owns hits such as Matchington Mansion and Wordscapes, slid from their offer price on Thursday, taking the shine off one of the biggest public market debuts of the year. The company, backed by private equity group KKR, raised $1.8bn in an initial public offering that gave it a market capitalisation of $28.6bn, but the stock opened some $10 below the $80 offer price and slid further in early trading. Consumers are borrowing less, hitting banks bottom lines The good news for banks is that consumers are flush with cash and less likely to fall behind on their debts. But this also means it will be that much longer before they need to borrow more. Banks really need loan growth to offset the effect of low interest rates and the drag of huge deposit inflows sitting in cash on their balance sheets. Many banks credit-card portfolios plunged during 2020 as consumers spent less and also paid down debt. In theory, the economic growth that is anticipated for this year would imply a greater use of credit by consumers and businesses to fund more activities. A Singaporean 33-year-olds $740 million fraud Ngs purported investment strategies that are under the spotlight were linked to nickel, a key ingredient in many electric-car batteries. The metal has become a popular speculative bet in recent years amid soaring demand for Teslas and other EVs. In one transaction described in charge sheets, Ng was involved in raising money from investors claiming he would use it to buy nickel from an Australian company called Poseidon Nickel Ltd. He never followed through with the purchase, prosecutors said. Poseidons chief executive officer, Peter Harold, said in an email that the company has had no engagement with Ng or related entities. Ng was involved in deceiving investors into buying supposed forward contracts that were purportedly with French lender BNP Paribas SA, but those contracts didnt exist, according to the charge sheets. BNP had no account or trading history with Ng, Envy Asset Management or Envy Global Trading, a person familiar with the matter said. Random Walk If you dont buy my argument that Coinbase is antithetical to the crypto project, take a look at the Bitcoin white paper: Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.

What Happened: The moderators of WallStreetBets will now allow discussions on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE)  but no other cryptocurrency  inside a daily Crypto discussion thread. I don't see the point in delaying the inevitable anymore as crypto is here to stay. After much deliberation, we've decided to allow for discussion about only BTC, ETH and DOGE only inside of a daily Crypto discussion thread as to not burden everyone with crypto spam, a post from moderator bawse1 on the site said.

(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Ever since Arthur Hayes became a star in the Bitcoin universe, hes been called many things, from trailblazer to anarchist. On April 6 the former chief executive officer of crypto exchange BitMEX surrendered to U.S. authorities in Hawaii to face a more consequential label:  alleged criminal Six months ago, prosecutors accused him and three others of failing to implement adequate money laundering controls. Hayes pleaded not guilty and was released on $10 million bond pending federal court proceedings in New York. His legal troubles come at a pivotal moment for the asset he championed. Regulators as well as Wall Street are stepping in to remake the crypto industry as the value of Bitcoin surges. It recently  traded at more than $60,000 up from about $7,000 a year ago. A 35-year-old American whos long lived in Asia, Hayes had no problem playing the crypto rebel who charged through the guardrails of traditional finance. In 2014 he launched BitMEX, where traders could invest not in Bitcoin itself but in contracts linked to its price moves. (The name is an apparent nod to older markets such as Nymex or Comex where traders swap oil or metals futures.) Contracts can allow traders to take positions quickly, to bet on prices falling as well as rising, and to use leverage to magnify their potential return and risk. I just loved the fact that with Bitcoin there wasnt much out there at that time, the former Citigroup Inc. equities trader  told Bloomberg News in a 2018 story It was an opportunity to do something on my own, to take some risk, rather than going to some structured, monolithic corporation. BitMEX became a force in the burgeoning crypto industry, handling about $65 billion a month in trades by the summer of 2020. Hayes became rich, with some media organizations reporting that he and his two co-founders had become billionaires. BitMEX, which still operates with offices in Hong Kong and elsewhere, permits traders to take on bets leveraged up to 100 times, a risky way to play a volatile asset. It doesnt handle normal currency; investors fund their accounts with Bitcoin. Under Hayes, prosecutors say, BitMEX didnt necessarily ask a lot of questions of people who wanted to trade there. The indictment says its website once advertised that no real name or other forms of verification were needed to get an account, just an email address. Hayess motto has been, Im a businessman, not a priest. He spoke of crypto as one of the worlds last free markets, saying at a 2019 industry conference in Taipei that Bitcoin represents an opportunityinstead of using courts, laws, and violence to govern how money is transferred between individuals and parties, we use open source software, cryptography, and math. Discussing traditional financial institutions criticism of Bitcoin as a tool of criminals and money launderers, Hayes told Bloomberg News in the 2018 story: I dont think banks have a leg to stand on. (Numerous big banks have paid hefty fines for lapses in anti-money-laundering rules.) He said Bitcoins technology made transactions more transparent than cash. Hayes incorporated his venture in the Seychelles and at the 2019 forum joked that the main difference between the island nations regulators and those in the U.S. was that the Americans cost more to bribe. That flippancy was on brand for the crypto world but may have proved Hayess undoing. The grand jury indictment in New York says, BitMEX made itself available as a vehicle for money laundering and sanctions violations. Hayes allegedly knew of claims that hackers whod ripped off a cryptocurrency exchange were using BitMEX to launder the proceeds of their crime, the court papers say. He also allegedly had knowledge that Iranian residents could be customers, and Iran is subject to U.S. prohibitions. In both instances, BitMEX didnt implement an anti-money-laundering policy in response, the indictment says. Hayes and his two co-founders also face civil charges from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that they ran an exchange without being registered in the U.S. The company was supposed to turn away U.S. customers, but BitMEX solicited them en masse from 2014 through the fall of 2020, says the CFTC. It says BitMEX paid U.S. customers to recruit other clients. Citing internal emails, the CFTC alleges that BitMEX personnel were well aware U.S. customers were using VPNsvirtual private networksto cover their tracks. Co-founders Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed have also pleaded not guilty in the criminal case and were released on bond. Longtime employee and executive Gregory Dwyer, charged criminally but not in the civil matter, is at large; his lawyers say the government knows his location. Attorneys for all four vow to fight the charges and say the U.S. authorities actions are unfounded. Arthur Hayes is a self-made entrepreneur who has been wrongly accused of crimes that he did not commit, his lawyers said in a statement. The case could lay down legal markers as crypto moves fitfully into the mainstream. It often takes authorities a while to catch up with technological leaps in finance, but U.S. regulators have hit other crypto companies with a flurry of civil cases and probes in the past year. Instead of fashioning rules to deal with Bitcoin and its ilk, they are leaning on existing laws. The Department of Justice is sending a clear messageif you try and skirt U.S. law and regulations, we will come after you, and not just with a civil action but with a criminal case, says Braden Perry, a former senior trial attorney at the CFTC whos now in private practice. He says that as alleged bad actors exit, more conservative financial institutions may become interested in crypto. Hayes and his co-founders resigned their executive positions. The new executive running BitMEX, Alexander Hptner, has set about changing the companys policies and tone. BitMEX says its verified its active customers identities. A statement on its website says its now one of the few crypto derivatives exchanges outside the U.S. to be implementing know-your-customer requirements before a user can complete their initial deposit and first trade. In a March interview with Bloomberg News, Hptner said hes bringing the crypto side to the regulated world. A spokesperson for BitMEXs holding company says the company disagrees with the charges and always sought to comply with applicable U.S. laws.

On Wednesday morning, the leading crypto set a new all-time high of $64,863.10 after a week-long bullish momentum. Over the last seven days, BTC is up by almost 12%, confirming the bullish momentum. Many analysts have linked the market uptrend of Bitcoin and other altcoins to Coinbases Nasdaq debut. Bitcoin is continuing its brilliant run of form in 2021, breaking new records with the prospect of breaking even more. One of the prospects, which many investors and enthusiasts would love, would be seeing Bitcoin trade at $75k. Bitcoin Sets A New All-Time High Following a good run of form, Bitcoin (BTC) broke past $63k to set a new ATH at $64,863.10. The run that began on April 7, with BTC trading at $58,186.51, peaked on Wednesday, April 14, when the leading crypto set a new ATH at nearly $65k. Bitcoins run has defied all odds and those critics who have been waiting since the start of the year for the Bitcoin bubble to burst. While they continue to wait, BTC is building even more momentum, looking at higher targets in the coming weeks. Building Momentum For $75k At the start of this year, talk of Bitcoin at $60k would have been considered crazy by many. However, today, BTC currently trades above $62k while aiming higher, and the charts are in its favor. Breaking above the $62,000 zone means that BTC has formed an ascending triangle pattern on the four-hour chart. Remaining above $62k could see BTC soar above $65k or possibly even higher in the short term. The only thing that could negate this trend is if BTC falls under $59,000. If Bitcoin, and the entire crypto market, holds on to the bullish momentum, Bitcoin is bound to break out even higher. The first major mark it would reach would be $70k before moving higher to $75k. Even if the uptrend plays out, we should expect a short-lived pullback or two as Bitcoin journeys to new highs. The crypto market joined Bitcoin for the bullish run as it climbed into uncharted territory on Wednesday morning, surpassing $2.23 trillion in market capitalization. The momentum builds as Coinbase makes its debut on Nasdaq. On the Flipside Bitcoin is witnessing a pullback after breaking its previous all-time high of $62k. In the early hours of Wednesday, Bitcoin peaked at $64,863.10 before the drop began. A 24-hour chart of the biggest cryptocurrency shows a 2% price drop, meaning BTC now changes hands for around $61,918. Coinbase Is Now Live On Nasdaq Coinbase, the most valuable crypto exchange with a market valuation of about $100 billion and 56 million verified retail customers, has opened on Nasdaq. Surprising many, Coinbase has avoided taking the initial public offering (IPO) route. Instead of an IPO, Coinbase has opted for a direct listing. Direct listings are known for being cost-efficient and give existing shareholders the option of selling their shares right away. Coinbase opened on Nasdaq on Wednesday morning with a starting reference price of $250. Coinbases debut on Nasdaq makes it the first major crypto business to list on the US stock market. Many analysts have attributed Bitcoins uptrend to Coinbases listing on Nasdaq.

A strong performance by the iron ore giants and a better-than expected March jobs report helped the market claw back losses after an early tumble. The local bourse ended 0.5 per cent higher at 7058.6 and touched a peak of 7071.5 late in the day, its highest point since February 20 last year. The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.5 per  cent to close at 7058.6 on Thursday. Credit: Louie Douvis Rio Tinto, BHP, and Fortescue Metals were solid throughout Thursdays trade - each having their best session in weeks - while energy firms also outperformed on improved oil prices. The markets recovery began when the major banks and biotech CSL joined the party, while the return to pre-CVOVID employment levels also seemed to boost investor confidence. CommSec markets analyst Steven Daghlian said the headline addition of 70,000 jobs for the month and a 5.6 per cent unemployment rate was better than most economists were expecting. The only negative is that all the job gains were part-time positions as opposed to full-time, Mr Daghlian said. The next few months should be interesting too, with the wind-down of Jobkeeper. Mr Daghlian said the uncertainties of COVID - including border closures and changes to the vaccine schedule - meant the markets charge to record highs was not a forgone conclusion. That said, he noted the index had gained in seven of the nine sessions so far this month, and was on track for a seventh straight month of gains. Its hard to tell if (eclipsing the record) is inevitable or not, but there have been quite strong gains lately, with a lot of momentum, Mr Daghlian said. The jobs rebound gathering pace is the kind of thing that can certainly help markets improve. It wasnt all rosy on the ASX on Thursday, with gold miners hit hard by weaker precious metals prices. Regis Resources, Resolute Mining, Evolution, Northern Star, St Barbara and Silver Lake Resources were among the markets worst 10 performers. Whitehaven Coal shares were savaged after it cut production and sales guidance, while Telstra, ResMed, Transurban, and Afterpay were also notable decliners. 4.25pm on Apr 15, 2021 ASX claws back early losses, finishes 0.5% higher By Alex Druce The ASX200 recovered from an early dive to finish 0.5 per cent higher at a new post-pandemic peak of 7058.6. At one point the index touched 7071.5 as it moved closer to the all-time peak set in February 2020. The market fell early, dropping by 0.5 per cent and back below 7000. The banks and biotech CSL then turned their early fortunes around. The market continued its recovery mission alongside a strong jobs report for March, in which the unemployment rate fell from 5.8 per cent to 5.6 per cent. Iron ore giants Rio Tinto, BHP, and Fortescue Metals were strong performers throughout Thursdays session, while energy firms also outperformed on improved oil prices. Gold miners and coal miner Whitehaven were savaged. Telstra, ResMed, Transurban, and Afterpay were also notable decliners. US futures were narrowly ahead at Thursday ASX close, hinting at gains on Wall Street tonight.

That seems to be the Commonwealth Banks modus operandi in response to the growing threat from the buy now, pay later sector. But like many well-thought-out tactical war strategies, the CBA is opting for the pincer attack. The first arm of it was last months announcement that it would launch its own BNPL product - which was a more vanilla competitive response. Matt Comyn in Canberra on Thursday: I dont think it is unreasonable given the scale of the individual players to make an investment in understanding their customer circumstances. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The more interesting motivation behind CBA moving into BNPL is to enlarge the sector sufficiently that it can no longer avoid regulation. There was no mistaking CBA chief executive Matt Comyns agenda when he turned up to Thursdays grilling before a House of Representatives standing committee in Canberra. He was gunning for the companies that are in the business of BNPL and, in particular, its largest participant, Afterpay. The committee gave him a perfect platform to publicly apply the blowtorch. His responses to a variety of questions around responsible lending, employment, house prices and the economy were textbook, measured, concise and in keeping with Comyns regulator style. 3.11pm on Apr 15, 2021 ASX now 0.6% ahead after early tumble By Alex Druce The Australian sharemarket was quick to reclaim its opening losses and has continued its revival act into the final hour of trade, gaining 0.6 per cent for the session. The index just touched a new 13-month high of 7068.2 and was more than 75 points to the better after dropping 0.5 per cent to 6988.6 at Thursdays open. The major banks joined the miners and energy stocks in positive territory, while biotech CSL also nudged in front. Wesfarmers and Woolworths also recovered, and Macquarie Group set a new record high of $157.725 when it rose 1.5 per cent. Telstra, Resmed, Transurban, Amcor, Afterpay, and the gold miners were still lower. US futures continued to climb higher and were pointing to gains on Wall Street tonight. 2.35pm on Apr 15, 2021 Pendal funds back above $100 billion By Alex Druce Wealth manager Pendal has grown its funds under management back above $100 billion on net inflows of $900 million and a strong quarter for equities. The ASX-listed fundie said net inflows over the three months March 31 came to $900 million, with a $900 million positive currency impact. Inflows of $700 million came from Australia, with substantially improved flows in the UK and Europe. A strong investment performance and higher equity markets contributed $2.5 billion to funds under management during the period. ASX-listed funds manager Pendal had a strong March quarter.

Importantly, we are now seeing a significant improvement in investment performance across the business, with many of our key strategies in the top quartile over the past year, Mr Good said.

In the U.S., which has a much longer history of bank regulation, the Federal Reserve took 58 enforcement actions in total.Among the infractions, Chinese investigators found fabricated financial statements, executives nannies and chauffeurs installed as controlling shareholders, and favorable rates and sweetheart deals for investors and relatives.The state has also bailed out three poorly-run small lenders and merged dozens more since its first crackdown three years ago. Still, out of 4,400 financial institutions, 12.4% are designated at high risk for failure by the central bank. Now, the government is rewriting the commercial banking law and will have zero tolerance for transgressions.Poor governance is obviously a risk for financial stability, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia economist of Natixis SA. If its contained within the countrys smallest institutions, the potential for damage is minimal, she added.The issue is that we dont really know whether governance problems are really contained and this is the big risk.The past week offered a fuller picture of the costs of mismanagement and unchecked corruption. Huarong, which has around $42 billion in outstanding debt at home and abroad, delayed its earnings report in early April, beginning a spiral thats seen its bonds fall to a record low of about 52 cents on the dollar. Its shares are down 67% since the 2015 debut and currently suspended.A China Huarong spokesperson said Thursday the company learned the lesson from Lai Xiaomins case, firmly implemented central government policies, continued to eliminate the toxic influence, restored our corporate governance, accelerated business transformation and management reform, and enhanced corporate governance to move toward stable and better development.Its the second time in two years that creditors have been left at the mercy of bad actors. In 2019, China jolted global markets with a surprise seizure of Baoshang Bank Co., once seen as a model for funding regional economies. Triggered by the misappropriation of funds by its controlling shareholder, the takeover and eventual bankruptcy of Baoshang also called into question long-held assumptions of a perpetual government backstop.In general, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has placed the blame for problems in the financial system on bank directors, shareholders and executives, saying in a December statement that ineffective corporate governance is the root cause.In one example, a rural bank lent the equivalent of 95% of its net capital to its shareholders and affiliates, according to the CBIRC, which didnt name the bank. Most of those loans defaulted or are non-performing.The largest shareholder at one bank inflated revenues by 80 million yuan to make the institution look profitable. Elsewhere, one person and 22 of what the regulator described as his shadow affiliates held stakes in 17 banks, far exceeding the limits on banking ownership.The regulator has also identified bad behavior in its own ranks, putting its official in charge of oversight of the rural banks under investigation for severe disciplinary and law violations.Social media, too, has allowed employees to air grievances and reports of wrongdoing. Earlier this year, a whistle-blower at China Life Insurance Co. claimed on the social network Sina Weibo that the branch head fabricated client signatures and pocketed millions of dollars of non-existent marketing expenses. Following a CBIRC investigation, the company said in a statement that it was fined 510,000 yuan for inadequate internal controls broadly and pledged to enhance compliance education.In response to the rising risks, the central bank is revising its commercial bank law. The proposed changes include a new chapter on corporate governance, which for the first time specifies the responsibilities of shareholders and the key role of the board of directors. It also bars entities from using borrowed money to invest in banks and prohibits directors from holding posts at more than one affiliated institution.Unlike in the U.S. and Europe where misconduct and mismanagement often lead to public outcry, regulatory probes, and even high-profile firings, top leaders have been so far insulated in China. Senior executives are rarely held responsible for branch-level violations, and the financial penalties pale compared with the 1.9 trillion yuan of profit the industry earned last year.This is work in progress, said James Stent, author of Chinas Banking Transformation and a former banker whos spent more than a decade on the boards of two Chinese lenders. Governance is generally good at priority large banks, but problems remain at lower level financial institutions. Addressing them will take time, and governance will always be imperfect.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 2d ago",http://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-btc-reaches-time-high-072800080.html,1

Some in the crypto world believe Nigeria is one of the few countries better placed to see a greater acceptance of digital currencies. However, despite this optimism, the Nigerian crypto industry continues to be plagued by constant hurdles that then complicate mass adoption efforts. Some of the problems faced include an uncertain regulatory environment as well as the proliferation of bitcoin-related scams which often taint the image of cryptocurrencies. However, according to Tony Emeka, the founder and CEO of Cryptotvplusa Nigerian crypto-focused media organization, some of these challenges can be overcome through education. Nigeria is very active when it comes to digital currencies and is one of the top countries in Africa in terms of cryptocurrency trade volumes. However, Nigerias blockchain and cryptocurrency industry has been dealing with regulatory uncertainty. In a question and answer session with Bitcoin.com News, Emeka discusses his latest education project Earnathonand why believes it will make a difference. The CEO also shares his views on the current impasse between the Central Bank of Nigeria and the crypto industry. To kick things off, Terence Zimwara (TZ) of Bitcoin.com News asked Emeka to share the background and experiences that motivated him to focus his efforts on crypto education? Tony Emeka (TE): The Nigerian crypto industry is noted to be one of the largest in the world considering market data. This growth has been due to the bad state of affairs of the nation and a strong enthusiasm by Nigerians to break free and make something for themselves. However, this celebrated growth has only been possible because of education. However, it has not been easy considering negative sentiments towards cryptocurrency as a tool for scams. Still, with the help of many individuals and business organisations, including Cryptotvplus, the industry has grown considerably. For instance, Cryptotvplus, through its education platform the Campus Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Awareness Tour (BCAT), has helped to raise awareness of blockchain and cryptocurrency across Nigeria since 2019. At one point, Cryptotvplus helped to organize one of the largest crypto-focused gatherings in West Africa. The education platform also helped to expose tens of thousands of individuals mostly students to crypto. On seeing the success of the BCAT campaign across Nigerian universities, it occurred to the team that there was a need to do more. For mass adoption to be achieved, it was imperative to automate the process and have millions of people learning crypto all at once. We also observed how incentivizing attendees via airdrops helped bring a lot of people to crypto. These experiences and ideas were the basis of Earnathon. To bring crypto education to millions of people globally. TZ: What is your impression on what is currently happening in the Nigerian crypto space, education-wise? TE: Education plays a unique role in shaping any (emerging) industry. Globally, there has been an increase in crypto education as well as greater awareness. This is reflected in the trackable search trends and user adoptions. But more has to be done. For mass adoption to be achieved, education efforts need to go to the grassroots. This is one thing that has been missing and now it is one of the things we are looking to do through Earnathon. TZ: I know crypto scams are a problem in Nigeria. Are you specifically dealing with this issue as well? TE: While scams cannot be eradicated totally they can be reduced to very low numbers. In Nigeria and around the world, crypto-related scams have risen and continue to rise, but quality crypto education is the key, the only potent weapon to fight fraudulent actors. Regulators can issue warnings and enforcement agencies will arrest bad actors. However, since these organizations are mostly reactive, education presents a fascinating solution. When people are proactive as a result of sound crypto knowledge, they can easily beat bad actors. Education is thus key. TZ: Now as someone who is trying to help raise awareness on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, how do you rate the ignorance levels in Government and the CBN? TE: The CBN stated in a circular published on February 7, 2021, that financial institutions could no longer facilitate crypto-related transactions. Surprisingly, the CBN position has been supported by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a few months after the same regulator classified cryptocurrencies as securities. This shows that the CBN and the govt still lack a good understanding of cryptocurrencies and money. TZ: So in your view, did the CBN fully understand (cryptocurrencies) or it just rushed its directive back in February? TE: The Circular on February 7th was somewhat from a position of fear. It was reactive. The apex bank ought to be proactive. The government had earlier noted it wanted to explore blockchain technology. This is only possible by creating a good environment for existing businesses to grow. But the circular was a setback for many businesses and thus, it seems rushed. TZ: How can this impasse between the crypto industry and the CBN be ended? TE: The position of the CBN on cryptocurrency seems to be on a faulty foundation. But progress can only come by engaging the regulator, showing them the possibilities, the importance of cryptocurrency and blockchain. No organization wants an intruder. Educating the CBN will enable it to see cryptocurrencies as tools for economic growth. Do you agree with Emekas assertion that education is a key step that will guarantee a greater acceptance of cryptos?

As a result, some coins are trading in the red zone. Top 10 coins by CoinMarketCap BTC/USD By the end of the day, Bitcoin (BTC) has faced its first correction after a breakout of $60,000. In this case, all of today's growth was absorbed. BTC/USD chart by TradingView On the daily chart, the situation is still bullish as the leading crypto has just retested the previous peak at $61,780. However, further growth may not be so fast as the coin needs to gain more power. In this regard, sideways trading in the range of $63,000-$64,000 is the more likely scenario for the upcoming days. Bitcoin is trading at $63,300 at press time. ETH/USD (ETH) is looking more bullish than Bitcoin (BTC) as the rate of the chief altcoin has gone up by 4% since yesterday. ETH/USD chart by TradingView However, Ethereum (ETH) might still make a restest of the level of $2,300 on the daily chart, as the coin needs more energy to attack the vital mark of $2,500, which may happen shortly. Ethereum is trading at $2,345 at press time. XRP/USD XRP is the biggest loser today as the rate of the coin has dropped by 1.67%. XRP/USD chart by TradingView Like Bitcoin (BTC), XRP is about to trade in the range soon. The volatilityshould decline, so the coin could accumulate more energy for the future rise. All in all, sideways trading between $1.75 and $1.85 is the more likely price action in the near future. XRP is trading at $1.69 at press time. ADA/USD The rate of Cardano (ADA) is almost unchanged since yesterday. ADA/USD chart by TradingView Even though the long-term trend remains bullish, sideways trading in the narrow range of $1.46-$1.54 is the more likely scenario as Cardano (ADA) is not ready to show the same sharp rise at the moment. Cardano is trading at $1.43 at press time. DOGE/USD DOGE is the top gainer today as its rate has blasted by 53.37%. DOGE/USD chart by TradingView DOGE is already overbought at the moment, which means that a more profound decline may occur. In this case, the potential support is located in the range of $0.11-$0.12. DOGE is trading at $0.1286 at press time. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the second-most growing coin today. Its rate has increased by 8% over the last 24 hours.

Market sentiment toward Bitcoin poses a major concern for the cryptocurrency, indicating it is approaching peak hype. Although Bitcoin faced a correction, BTCs MVRV ratio suggests it could be setting itself up for further price appreciation. Bitcoin has continued to record new all-time highs and most recently surpassed $64,000. Bitcoin sentiment shifts to overwhelmingly bullish for the first time in two months According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the market has started constructing new on-chain support. Over 245,000 Bitcoin have moved on-chain at prices above $62,700. The UTXO realized price distribution shows at which prices the current UTXOs were created. In the previous $1 trillion consolidation zone, while Bitcoin was trading between $53,000 to $60,000, 1.9 million BTC were moved on-chain. Bitcoin UTXO realized price distribution While Bitcoin has managed to find support at $62,000, crypto behavioral analytics platform Santiment found that the number of whale addresses is at 2021 lows. However, smaller addresses are increasingly being created. Despite a decline in whale addresses, Bitcoin whale transactions have increased while the cryptocurrencyreached record highs Market sentiment toward Bitcoin has also skyrocketed in the past 24 hours, shifting from relatively bearish to overwhelmingly bullish for the first time in two months. However, according to historical data, extremely bullish sentiment led to corrections in the past. Santiments data suggests that Bitcoin is approaching peak hype, which could mean that further consolidation could be coming. Bitcoin's perpetual contract funding rate also rose in tandem with its price, reaching as high as 0.1% on Binance. In the recent rally, Bitcoin longs are paying shorts, as sentiment is extremely bullish. However, high funding rates have marked each Bitcoin cycle top, indicating fast-rising bullish bias and a market full of overleveraged longs, according to Santiment. Bitcoin could be aiming for further price appreciation After reaching its record high, the recent Bitcoin correctionwas also likely due to a spike in Bitcoins Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL), suggesting that investors are increasingly taking profit. The pioneer digital currencys inability to surpass $65,000 was likely due to sell-offs and profit-taking. Bitcoin NPL However, Bitcoin price could still be aiming for further growth, as both Bitcoins short-term and long-term MVRV ratios remain relatively low. The higher the MVRV ratio, the more unrealized profits  the higher the chance Bitcoin holders could begin to take profit and reduce their exposure. Santiment further suggests that although overall trends point to further Bitcoin price appreciation a short-term correction may be needed for the market to properly normalize.

nasdaq,NotProvided,2021-04-15 00:00:00,Animal Spirits or Tangible Intrinsic Value: Whats Driving Bitcoin Right Now?,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",") weve seen play out in recent years has boggled my mind. Source: Shutterstock I mean, the long-term chart doesnt lie. Were talking about a digital token that has appreciated more than 10,000% over the past 5 years. Indeed, theres a strong long-term bull thesis to be made when it comes to Bitcoin. Considering the turnout for the recent Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN ) IPO crypto investors are intent on making a statement. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are here to stay. Sentiment remains strong, particularly among retail investors, in the long-term growth trajectory of Bitcoin. Many money managers disagree, saying animal spirits are driving the party right now. So, whos right? Lets take a look at both sides of the coin. Bitcoin: Size Matters Cryptocurrencies are skyrocketing as a group. However, its intriguing to note the amount of interest in Bitcoin among retail investors relative to alt coins. I think a lot of this has to do with the fact Bitcoin makes up approximately 55% of the total market capitalizationof all cryptocurrencies today. As the largest crypto token in the world, Bitcoin pricesare often used as a gauge of the sectors performance. That said, alt coins are now starting to move in lower correlation to Bitcoin. In recent weeks, a number of alt coins have experienced gains far outpacing those of Bitcoin, suggesting these digital tokens may not move entirely in sync anymore. Regardless, Bitcoin remains the gold standard. In fact, many view this cryptocurrency as digital gold. 7 Pet Stocks That Make Good Long-Term Holdings Theres evidence that golds recent fizzling out has something to dowith the rise in Bitcoin prices Investors are looking for places to park cash right now, and cash, bonds and gold just dont move very much. However, Bitcoin does move. Quite a bit actually. The volatility seems to frighten no one, when its on the upside. As a hedge, a store of cash or just simply a speculative investment, Bitcoin appears to be a no-lose proposition right now. That is, unless you ask big money right now. Risks Are Real, So Trade Carefully Despite all these great catalysts, there is real concern that a massive bubble is forming in the cryptocurrency space. An intriguing reportreleased by CNBC indicates a vast majority of money managers suggest a bubble is more likely than not in Bitcoin right now. The report indicates roughly 74% of money managers surveyed, folks who have a cumulative assets under management of more than $500 billion, are of this belief. One specific bear that was called out was Bobby Lee, founder of cryptocurrency exchange BTCC. Mr. Lee noted that an 80% to 90% drop could materialize at some point in the near term, after Bitcoin is done appreciating to as high as $300,000. Other bears have suggestedBitcoin has the potential to fall to zero. A Yale stud y recently put that percentage likelihood at around 0.4% Indeed, thats a small percentage. And every investment comes with some sort of risk of bankruptcy at some point. However, the polarized view on Bitcoin right now is intriguing. It appears bulls and bears are sitting very far apart today. Conclusion My personal take on cryptocurrencies in general is mixed. On the one hand, I do think theres a tremendous amount of value in the blockchain technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. I think its a transformative technology with great potential to change how we think about banking, insurance and other industries. Theres a lot of real-world application at play, particularly with Ethereums (CCC: ETH-USD ) protocol. On the other hand, the thought of Bitcoin as a store of value or a replacement for gold doesnt jive with me. I dont see cryptocurrencies as currency-like at all. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are two separate things, and I think both have been jumbled together right now. When the dust settles, and blockchain becomes widely used and regulated, I think those betting on blockchain technologies will win big. However, I would consider myself in the bear camp in regards to the long-term upside for Bitcoin or its alt-coin peers.
