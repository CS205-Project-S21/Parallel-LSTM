AFP Former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak's shocking admission of cricket corruption has also shone a light on cryptocurrency finding a place in the bookies' list of enticements -- a brand new challenge for the ICC's Anti-Corruption Unit, which claims to be ready for the battle. Streak was on Wednesday banned by the ICC for eight years after admitting to disclose inside information to a suspected Indian bookie during his coaching stints in Zimbabwe, Bangladesh as well as the IPL, Afghanistan Premier League and the Bangladesh Premier League. Till date, cash has been the most preferred mode of payment for bookies, who also pay in kind with cars, jewellery and high-end phones. However, Streak's case has thrown up the use of bitcoin in corrupt payments. The ICC's detailed judgement in the case has revealed that Streak once received two ""bitcoins"" from a corruptor in 2018, valued at $35,000 at that time. ""It is a new phenomenon for us, but we have staff capable of investigating it. Corrupters try to use all modes including cash and 'hawala', which are not easy to trace either. Bitcoins pose a similar challenge,"" ICC ACU General Manager Alex Marshall said in an email reply to PTI's query on Thursday. So what is cryptocurrency? In layman's language, ""Cryptocurrency"" is virtual money. It is the purchase of a digital asset based on an algorithm. The bitcoins that are generated aren't regulated by any central banking authority in any country (like the Reserve Bank of India) and in many countries like India, it is still an illegal tender. In simpler words, it is a ""Blockchain Industry"" where a financial transaction between two people sitting in two different parts of the world will not have any intermediaries. The valuation of one bitcoin is staggering. One bitcoin's INR value currently stands at Rs 46.83 lakh or $62,453. However, the bigger challenge is that coding of ""cryptocurrency"" is believed to be watertight. There are elaborately programmed vaults (digital) and the tracking can be infinitely more difficult when compared to paper tenders like INR, USD or GBP. Marshall said that ICC is up for the challenge in the coming days now that a new method of corruption has emerged. ""Tracking bitcoin transactions may not be easy but we have the right people with the right expertise, understanding and network needed to ensure we stay ahead of the corruptors,"" Marshall said. Even BCCI's new head of Anti Corruption Unit (ACU) Shabbir Hussain Shekhadam Khandwawala said that he heard of payment through bitcoins for the first time. ""Yes, I was going through the details of the Heath Streak case. I have also heard about bitcoin transaction for the first time,"" the former DGP of Gujarat Police told PTI. However, Hussain feels that tracking of corrupt people is not always about the keeping a vigil on the mode of transactions. ""We always catch the people not by the amount or how the money is paid (bitcoins in this case). Our clues are different. We keep a watch on them and their activities and telephonic calls,"" Hussain said. ""Some things happen underground also,"" he said, adding ""Everything has to be on the basis of the solid information received from sources. ""So if someone has accepted money or been involved in graft in any form, once you start investigation, you are able to reach that,"" he said.

On Wednesday morning, the leading crypto set a new all-time high of $64,863.10 after a week-long bullish momentum. Over the last seven days, BTC is up by almost 12%, confirming the bullish momentum. Many analysts have linked the market uptrend of Bitcoin and other altcoins to Coinbases Nasdaq debut. Bitcoin is continuing its brilliant run of form in 2021, breaking new records with the prospect of breaking even more. One of the prospects, which many investors and enthusiasts would love, would be seeing Bitcoin trade at $75k. Bitcoin Sets A New All-Time High Following a good run of form, Bitcoin (BTC) broke past $63k to set a new ATH at $64,863.10. The run that began on April 7, with BTC trading at $58,186.51, peaked on Wednesday, April 14, when the leading crypto set a new ATH at nearly $65k. Bitcoins run has defied all odds and those critics who have been waiting since the start of the year for the Bitcoin bubble to burst. While they continue to wait, BTC is building even more momentum, looking at higher targets in the coming weeks. Building Momentum For $75k At the start of this year, talk of Bitcoin at $60k would have been considered crazy by many. However, today, BTC currently trades above $62k while aiming higher, and the charts are in its favor. Breaking above the $62,000 zone means that BTC has formed an ascending triangle pattern on the four-hour chart. Remaining above $62k could see BTC soar above $65k or possibly even higher in the short term. The only thing that could negate this trend is if BTC falls under $59,000. If Bitcoin, and the entire crypto market, holds on to the bullish momentum, Bitcoin is bound to break out even higher. The first major mark it would reach would be $70k before moving higher to $75k. Even if the uptrend plays out, we should expect a short-lived pullback or two as Bitcoin journeys to new highs. The crypto market joined Bitcoin for the bullish run as it climbed into uncharted territory on Wednesday morning, surpassing $2.23 trillion in market capitalization. The momentum builds as Coinbase makes its debut on Nasdaq. On the Flipside Bitcoin is witnessing a pullback after breaking its previous all-time high of $62k. In the early hours of Wednesday, Bitcoin peaked at $64,863.10 before the drop began. A 24-hour chart of the biggest cryptocurrency shows a 2% price drop, meaning BTC now changes hands for around $61,918. Coinbase Is Now Live On Nasdaq Coinbase, the most valuable crypto exchange with a market valuation of about $100 billion and 56 million verified retail customers, has opened on Nasdaq. Surprising many, Coinbase has avoided taking the initial public offering (IPO) route. Instead of an IPO, Coinbase has opted for a direct listing. Direct listings are known for being cost-efficient and give existing shareholders the option of selling their shares right away. Coinbase opened on Nasdaq on Wednesday morning with a starting reference price of $250. Coinbases debut on Nasdaq makes it the first major crypto business to list on the US stock market. Many analysts have attributed Bitcoins uptrend to Coinbases listing on Nasdaq.

Its currently increasing towards the closest resistance...","The approval comes just over two months after Canada approved its first bitcoin ETF. 21h ago Huarong Debacle Highlights Problems at Hundreds of Chinese Banks (Bloomberg) -- Lai Xiaomin, former chairman of China Huarong Asset Management Co., was found guilty of accepting $277 million in bribes, as well as bigamy, crimes serious enough to see him summarily executed in January.Such extreme behavior -- and consequences -- are rare in any country. But in China, more modest but still flagrant mismanagement is common in the $54 trillion financial industry.In 2020 alone, the countrys top banking regulator issued almost 3,200 violations against institutions and 4,554 against individuals ranging from senior executives to rank-and-file staff; it levied fines totaling 2.3 billion yuan ($352.2 million). In the U.S., which has a much longer history of bank regulation, the Federal Reserve took 58 enforcement actions in total.Among the infractions, Chinese investigators found fabricated financial statements, executives nannies and chauffeurs installed as controlling shareholders, and favorable rates and sweetheart deals for investors and relatives.The state has also bailed out three poorly-run small lenders and merged dozens more since its first crackdown three years ago. Still, out of 4,400 financial institutions, 12.4% are designated at high risk for failure by the central bank. Now, the government is rewriting the commercial banking law and will have zero tolerance for transgressions.Poor governance is obviously a risk for financial stability, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia economist of Natixis SA. If its contained within the countrys smallest institutions, the potential for damage is minimal, she added.The issue is that we dont really know whether governance problems are really contained and this is the big risk.The past week offered a fuller picture of the costs of mismanagement and unchecked corruption. Huarong, which has around $42 billion in outstanding debt at home and abroad, delayed its earnings report in early April, beginning a spiral thats seen its bonds fall to a record low of about 52 cents on the dollar. Its shares are down 67% since the 2015 debut and currently suspended.A China Huarong spokesperson said Thursday the company learned the lesson from Lai Xiaomins case, firmly implemented central government policies, continued to eliminate the toxic influence, restored our corporate governance, accelerated business transformation and management reform, and enhanced corporate governance to move toward stable and better development.Its the second time in two years that creditors have been left at the mercy of bad actors. In 2019, China jolted global markets with a surprise seizure of Baoshang Bank Co., once seen as a model for funding regional economies. Triggered by the misappropriation of funds by its controlling shareholder, the takeover and eventual bankruptcy of Baoshang also called into question long-held assumptions of a perpetual government backstop.In general, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has placed the blame for problems in the financial system on bank directors, shareholders and executives, saying in a December statement that ineffective corporate governance is the root cause.In one example, a rural bank lent the equivalent of 95% of its net capital to its shareholders and affiliates, according to the CBIRC, which didnt name the bank. Most of those loans defaulted or are non-performing.The largest shareholder at one bank inflated revenues by 80 million yuan to make the institution look profitable. Elsewhere, one person and 22 of what the regulator described as his shadow affiliates held stakes in 17 banks, far exceeding the limits on banking ownership.The regulator has also identified bad behavior in its own ranks, putting its official in charge of oversight of the rural banks under investigation for severe disciplinary and law violations.Social media, too, has allowed employees to air grievances and reports of wrongdoing. Earlier this year, a whistle-blower at China Life Insurance Co. claimed on the social network Sina Weibo that the branch head fabricated client signatures and pocketed millions of dollars of non-existent marketing expenses. Following a CBIRC investigation, the company said in a statement that it was fined 510,000 yuan for inadequate internal controls broadly and pledged to enhance compliance education.In response to the rising risks, the central bank is revising its commercial bank law. The proposed changes include a new chapter on corporate governance, which for the first time specifies the responsibilities of shareholders and the key role of the board of directors. It also bars entities from using borrowed money to invest in banks and prohibits directors from holding posts at more than one affiliated institution.Unlike in the U.S. and Europe where misconduct and mismanagement often lead to public outcry, regulatory probes, and even high-profile firings, top leaders have been so far insulated in China. Senior executives are rarely held responsible for branch-level violations, and the financial penalties pale compared with the 1.9 trillion yuan of profit the industry earned last year.This is work in progress, said James Stent, author of Chinas Banking Transformation and a former banker whos spent more than a decade on the boards of two Chinese lenders. Governance is generally good at priority large banks, but problems remain at lower level financial institutions. Addressing them will take time, and governance will always be imperfect.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 2d ago",http://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-btc-reaches-time-high-072800080.html

Read on and find out how he did it.,"Joseph Ebuka , a Peer from Lagos City in Nigeria whos not only an active crypto trader and blockchain enthusiast but an art curator and freelancer as well. Instead of focusing on one thing to achieve his creative and financial goals, he brought together his love for art and Bitcoin (BTC) and made them work for him. Want to know how? Learn as Joseph shares how hes able to enjoy the best of both worlds. The beginning of his art journey Joseph started to have a keen interest in art when one of his friends shared rewarding opportunities with him. My love for art and the creative energy of the artists around me made me join the art business. We then decided to create a community of artists and creatives under a brand umbrella called Cokespice, he said. He started earning money from art when his group hosted their first traditional art exhibition in Abuja back in 2017. This exhibit became an avenue for featured local artists to showcase their incredible crafts, connect with art collectors, and make money from commissioned works. Ive just started my journey into the art collection and I have about four artworks in my gallery already. Right now, my most preferred medium of art is oil paintings on canvas, but Im also interested in graphics and pencil art, Joseph added. Navigating creative opportunities with Bitcoin It was only less than a year ago when Joseph started crypto trading. Hes using the Paxful mobile application to trade and manage his crypto funds anytime and anywhere. Since hes an active trader and his savings are mostly in crypto, Joseph found it easy to use Bitcoin in his freelance art business. But how smooth are crypto transactions on Paxful? He told us, It was a pretty swift process. My recent purchase was a physical painting, so I went to the artists studio. He also owns a Paxful Wallet, which made the transaction easier and faster. All I did was ask for his wallet address and send him my BTC payment. Since it was an internal transfer, I was charged with 0 fees and the artist received my payment instantly. According to Joseph, Bitcoin will add more value to both the art and the artist since they can withdraw money in the currency they prefer, and their artworks can be exchanged as a token for value. I actually buy artwork based on its perceived valueits not just a painting, its also an investment based on value exchange, he stated. Is blockchain the future of art? Joseph deems that blockchain technology can create a significant shift in the art world soon. I believe that blockchain is the future of art, and that future is now. Hes also looking forward to the growth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)digital tokens tied to unique tradable assetsin the African scene. Based on the recognition of talents and crafts, the art and paint industry in Nigeria has done well enough to be recognized. Im excited to see a major shift in the art industry in the near future, especially with the rise of crypto in the art market. Theres so much potential, he stated. Joseph also attends art auctions on Telegram, where he connects with international and local artists selling their works on blockchain platforms. He spreads the word about Bitcoin and blockchain technology with others who arent very familiar with it, whenever possible. Are you an art enthusiast with a passion for Bitcoin?

Some in the crypto world believe Nigeria is one of the few countries better placed to see a greater acceptance of digital currencies. However, despite this optimism, the Nigerian crypto industry continues to be plagued by constant hurdles that then complicate mass adoption efforts. Some of the problems faced include an uncertain regulatory environment as well as the proliferation of bitcoin-related scams which often taint the image of cryptocurrencies. However, according to Tony Emeka, the founder and CEO of Cryptotvplusa Nigerian crypto-focused media organization, some of these challenges can be overcome through education. Nigeria is very active when it comes to digital currencies and is one of the top countries in Africa in terms of cryptocurrency trade volumes. However, Nigerias blockchain and cryptocurrency industry has been dealing with regulatory uncertainty. In a question and answer session with Bitcoin.com News, Emeka discusses his latest education project Earnathonand why believes it will make a difference. The CEO also shares his views on the current impasse between the Central Bank of Nigeria and the crypto industry. To kick things off, Terence Zimwara (TZ) of Bitcoin.com News asked Emeka to share the background and experiences that motivated him to focus his efforts on crypto education? Tony Emeka (TE): The Nigerian crypto industry is noted to be one of the largest in the world considering market data. This growth has been due to the bad state of affairs of the nation and a strong enthusiasm by Nigerians to break free and make something for themselves. However, this celebrated growth has only been possible because of education. However, it has not been easy considering negative sentiments towards cryptocurrency as a tool for scams. Still, with the help of many individuals and business organisations, including Cryptotvplus, the industry has grown considerably. For instance, Cryptotvplus, through its education platform the Campus Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Awareness Tour (BCAT), has helped to raise awareness of blockchain and cryptocurrency across Nigeria since 2019. At one point, Cryptotvplus helped to organize one of the largest crypto-focused gatherings in West Africa. The education platform also helped to expose tens of thousands of individuals mostly students to crypto. On seeing the success of the BCAT campaign across Nigerian universities, it occurred to the team that there was a need to do more. For mass adoption to be achieved, it was imperative to automate the process and have millions of people learning crypto all at once. We also observed how incentivizing attendees via airdrops helped bring a lot of people to crypto. These experiences and ideas were the basis of Earnathon. To bring crypto education to millions of people globally. TZ: What is your impression on what is currently happening in the Nigerian crypto space, education-wise? TE: Education plays a unique role in shaping any (emerging) industry. Globally, there has been an increase in crypto education as well as greater awareness. This is reflected in the trackable search trends and user adoptions. But more has to be done. For mass adoption to be achieved, education efforts need to go to the grassroots. This is one thing that has been missing and now it is one of the things we are looking to do through Earnathon. TZ: I know crypto scams are a problem in Nigeria. Are you specifically dealing with this issue as well? TE: While scams cannot be eradicated totally they can be reduced to very low numbers. In Nigeria and around the world, crypto-related scams have risen and continue to rise, but quality crypto education is the key, the only potent weapon to fight fraudulent actors. Regulators can issue warnings and enforcement agencies will arrest bad actors. However, since these organizations are mostly reactive, education presents a fascinating solution. When people are proactive as a result of sound crypto knowledge, they can easily beat bad actors. Education is thus key. TZ: Now as someone who is trying to help raise awareness on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, how do you rate the ignorance levels in Government and the CBN? TE: The CBN stated in a circular published on February 7, 2021, that financial institutions could no longer facilitate crypto-related transactions. Surprisingly, the CBN position has been supported by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a few months after the same regulator classified cryptocurrencies as securities. This shows that the CBN and the govt still lack a good understanding of cryptocurrencies and money. TZ: So in your view, did the CBN fully understand (cryptocurrencies) or it just rushed its directive back in February? TE: The Circular on February 7th was somewhat from a position of fear. It was reactive. The apex bank ought to be proactive. The government had earlier noted it wanted to explore blockchain technology. This is only possible by creating a good environment for existing businesses to grow. But the circular was a setback for many businesses and thus, it seems rushed. TZ: How can this impasse between the crypto industry and the CBN be ended? TE: The position of the CBN on cryptocurrency seems to be on a faulty foundation. But progress can only come by engaging the regulator, showing them the possibilities, the importance of cryptocurrency and blockchain. No organization wants an intruder. Educating the CBN will enable it to see cryptocurrencies as tools for economic growth. Do you agree with Emekas assertion that education is a key step that will guarantee a greater acceptance of cryptos?

Market sentiment toward Bitcoin poses a major concern for the cryptocurrency, indicating it is approaching peak hype. Although Bitcoin faced a correction, BTCs MVRV ratio suggests it could be setting itself up for further price appreciation. Bitcoin has continued to record new all-time highs and most recently surpassed $64,000. Bitcoin sentiment shifts to overwhelmingly bullish for the first time in two months According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the market has started constructing new on-chain support. Over 245,000 Bitcoin have moved on-chain at prices above $62,700. The UTXO realized price distribution shows at which prices the current UTXOs were created. In the previous $1 trillion consolidation zone, while Bitcoin was trading between $53,000 to $60,000, 1.9 million BTC were moved on-chain. Bitcoin UTXO realized price distribution While Bitcoin has managed to find support at $62,000, crypto behavioral analytics platform Santiment found that the number of whale addresses is at 2021 lows. However, smaller addresses are increasingly being created. Despite a decline in whale addresses, Bitcoin whale transactions have increased while the cryptocurrencyreached record highs Market sentiment toward Bitcoin has also skyrocketed in the past 24 hours, shifting from relatively bearish to overwhelmingly bullish for the first time in two months. However, according to historical data, extremely bullish sentiment led to corrections in the past. Santiments data suggests that Bitcoin is approaching peak hype, which could mean that further consolidation could be coming. Bitcoin's perpetual contract funding rate also rose in tandem with its price, reaching as high as 0.1% on Binance. In the recent rally, Bitcoin longs are paying shorts, as sentiment is extremely bullish. However, high funding rates have marked each Bitcoin cycle top, indicating fast-rising bullish bias and a market full of overleveraged longs, according to Santiment. Bitcoin could be aiming for further price appreciation After reaching its record high, the recent Bitcoin correctionwas also likely due to a spike in Bitcoins Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL), suggesting that investors are increasingly taking profit. The pioneer digital currencys inability to surpass $65,000 was likely due to sell-offs and profit-taking. Bitcoin NPL However, Bitcoin price could still be aiming for further growth, as both Bitcoins short-term and long-term MVRV ratios remain relatively low. The higher the MVRV ratio, the more unrealized profits  the higher the chance Bitcoin holders could begin to take profit and reduce their exposure. Santiment further suggests that although overall trends point to further Bitcoin price appreciation a short-term correction may be needed for the market to properly normalize.

Bitcoin (BTC) Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitcoin? Balances - block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions - private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing - mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.

The virtual currency was worth about $13 per unit in January, before a media frenzy whipped up demand and drove Bitcoin values past $1,200 in November. The currency for people who don't like dollars is proving something here, inspiring JPMorgan Chase ( ) to research its own alternative to Bitcoin. But wait a second before you load up your retirement portfolio with Bitcoins. The value of a Bitcoin turned out to be volatile in both directions. In the video below, Fool analyst Anders Bylund explains why you might want to play around with some fraction of a Bitcoin but should treat the virtual currency as a plaything and not an investment.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-14 15:44:00,Where Can You Buy Bitcoins? -- The Motley Fool,"Most of the headlines involve where you can spend your bitcoins, but where can you buy some of the virtual currency?",") Oct 19, 2014 at 4:44PM The concept of a digital currency has really taken off over the past couple of years. Bitcoin's massive surge in price, combined with the ever-increasing number of retailers who accept the currency has made quite a few headlines. Source: flickr user Marc van der Chijs However, most of the headlines tend to be about businesses that accept bitcoins. And I'm partially to blame -- my previous bitcoin article was about places where you can spend the virtual currency. Many people have no idea how to acquire bitcoins. With this in mind, here is a quick guide on how to get some bitcoins of your own to spend or to hold. Two ways to get them When it comes to acquiring bitcoins, there are two main ways to do it: mining or buying. Mining involves buying expensive computing equipment that solves complex mathematical problems in the bitcoin network, for which the ""miner"" is rewarded with newly created coins. The problem with mining is that as more coins are mined and as more people join in, the process gets exponentially more difficult, diminishing both returns and the value of the hardware itself. At this point, being profitable in bitcoin mining is a very speculative venture, and is probably best left to professionals. That brings us to buying bitcoins, however it's not quite as easy as it sounds. Here is a quick guide to buying bitcoins for your own ""wallet."" Buying from an exchange There are a few bitcoin exchanges out there, such as Coinbase, where people can create their own bitcoin ""wallet"" and purchase their own bitcoins. All you need to do is set up an account, link and verify your bank account, and buy your bitcoins at the current exchange rate. Buying on Coinbase takes a few days before your bitcoins are available in your wallet, but you pay the price shown at the time you place your order. And there is an ""instant buy"" feature with lower daily limits that requires you to link a Visa credit card to your account. While Coinbase is the biggest and most reputable place to buy bitcoins, there are several other exchanges, and a good list is available here Be careful of scams, however, and make sure you verify the authenticity of any exchange before making a purchase. Just a hint: the prices should be close to each other on all legitimate exchanges. If Coinbase is selling bitcoins for $400 and a small exchange lists the price as $320, it should be a big red flag. Can I use my credit card or buy with cash? Not really. I mentioned that Coinbase allows you to link a credit card, but this is a backup payment method only. In other words, if your bank declines a purchase transaction, Coinbase can charge your credit card. As far as cash goes, you can buy with cash, but it's a little tough to do right now for most people. The good news is that it's getting easier. The new concept of a bitcoin ATM has really caught on, and in just a few months, a pretty good network of ATMs has been built up, as you can see on this map Using a bitcoin ATM, you can use cash to purchase bitcoins, and some machines allow you to exchange your own bitcoins for cash. Check out these examplesfrom Genesis Coin to see what they look like. As bitcoin becomes more and more mainstream, this network should continue to expand. Coming soon While it's not the most complicated act in the world to buy bitcoins today, it's definitely not as mainstream-friendly as it could be. For instance, if there were a bitcoin ATM in every American town, or if bitcoins could be easily acquired with a credit card, I'd be willing to bet a lot more people would get involved. And, that may be coming sooner than you think, thanks to the rapid expansion of the bitcoin ATM network, and PayPal's recent first step toward bitcoin integration by allowing its merchants to accept bitcoin payments. While it may be some time away, if PayPal's 100 million active users are able to buy, hold, and transfer bitcoins in their accounts, it could be the big push bitcoin needs to really break into the mainstream. In the meantime, unless you happen to live near one of the ATMs, an online exchange (specifically Coinbase) linked to your bank account is the best way to get your hands on some of the virtual currency.

shacknews,NotProvided,2021-04-14 14:31:00,Bitcoin (BTC) almost reaches $65K high ahead of Coinbase direct listing,"As Coinbase prepares to go public in the stock market, it has boded well for the valuation of various cryptocurrencies.","1 Coinbase has much of the eyes of the stock market on cryptocurrency today. After quite a period of teasing and preparation the cryptocurrency trader is set to go public with an direct listing on the Nasdaq expected today. Its a huge moment for the legitimacy of cryptocurrency as Coinbase represents one of the most notable platforms in cryptocurrency exchange. It can be seen throughout the valuation of various crypto today, such as Bitcoin, which reached nearly $65,000 in valuation just ahead of Coinbases direct listing. Coinbases listing day on the Nasdaq takes place on April 14, 2021, as reported by the company itself This follows about a month after Coinbase was valued at around $68 billion in mid-March for its upcoming listing. While some experts in the financial sector claim that Coinbase may be overvalued due to the constant volatility and nature of cryptocurrency as a whole, many agree this a watershed moment for cryptocurrency, as reported by MarketWatch Nowhere can this be seen as more apparent than in the valuation of Bitcoin, which topped out at a high of $64,895 in valuation today ahead of Coinbases listing. Bitcoin value has been on the rise for a while, but it took another steep jump leading into Coinbase's direct listing on the Nasdaq on April 14. Now Bitcoins rising valuation isnt simply the work of Coinbase going public. The popular cryptocurrency has been rising in value for a while on a number of factors, not the least of which was Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musks public support of it as well as the Tesla companys move to invest in Bitcoinand begin allowing it as an acceptable currency for transactions. With these things considered, Bitcoin has actually been on the rise for quite a while. However, other cryptocurrencies are also experiencing growth which seem to coincide with Coinbases listing. Dogecoinin particular, long considered to be a meme currency, found its way to valuation of around $.10 a unitthis last week, which is notable to say the least. As Coinbase arrives on the Nasdaq today, it and all cryptocurrency values will be well worth watching. For major news and updates on the matter, stay tuned right here at Shacknews.

That being said, both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnsons (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. Well get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal, but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March, up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that its up isnt too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately, but its good to see its only a little above expectations. Thats in contrast to last Fridays producer price index, which came in way, way, above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJs Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isnt great news, obviously, but its nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer, and this might slow the momentum, but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also, people shouldnt think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine, but it isnt surprising that a complication got reported, simply because vaccines arent widgets. Like any medical product, theyre complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. Its a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted out of an abundance of caution. Its unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this, but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S., and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back, but in a worst-case scenario its off the market for an extended period, putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the reopening stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning were seeing shares of airlines, casinos, and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Streets attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure, a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear, but its nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile, volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62,000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up, but still below 17.5, which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless theres big news out of the FDA press conference, trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrows onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope, youre not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this years reopening darlings like airlines, energy companies, and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before todays JNJ vaccine news, remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news, with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products, which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday, but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while, the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industrys efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago, so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that, trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS), and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always, investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading, where theres often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season, FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1, so things are definitely looking up. In fact, the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will, 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called cyclicals like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop Theres always a caveat, and heres one: The Covid situation isnt really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend, telling 60 Minutes that hes concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course, there was todays bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing, watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators, and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people.

""Investing in cryptoassets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors' money,"" the FCA said. ""If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money."" It also means people should make sure they understand what they're investing in, the risks associated with investing, and any regulatory protections that apply, the FCA added. That's doubly true when most investments in Bitcoin take place in a way that mean Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) can't protect you in the way they can with normal savings and investments. A Bitcoin ATM at a shop (Image: SWNS) People should be particularly concerned about cold callers, the FCA said. ""Consumers should be wary if they're contacted out of the blue, pressured to invest quickly or promised returns that sound too good to be true,"" the FCA said. But that doesn't mean you can't buy Bitcoin safely. Since 10 January 2021, real UK cryptoasset firms have been registered with the FCA under regulations to tackle money laundering. That means there is a way to check they're legitimate. To help, the FCA produced a quick guide to the risks of investing as well as the ways to check you're buying from a legitimate provider. ""Consumers should be aware of the risks and fully consider whether investing in high-return investments based on cryptoassets is appropriate for them,"" the FCA said. ""They should check and carefully consider the cryptoasset business involved."" How to check a crypto firm is legitimate Step 1: Consumers should check if the firm they're using is on the Financial Services Register or list of firms with Temporary Registration (Note: appearing on the Temporary Registration Register does not mean that the FCA has assessed them as fit and proper, nor that the FCA has determined their application for the purposes of the Money Laundering Regulations). Step 2: If they're not on the register, consumers should ask the firm whether they are entitled to carry on business without being registered with the FCA. Step 3: If they're not registered, the FCA suggests that consumers should withdraw their cryptoassets and/or money. This is because the firm is operating illegally if it has not ceased trading by 9 January 2021.

dazeinfo,NotProvided,2021-04-14 12:12:09,Bitcoin Hits Record $1.2 Trillion Market Cap: Much Faster Than All Top Tech Giants,"Fueled by consumers' rising interest in cryptocurrencies and institutional buyers, bitcoin has touched an all-time high value of a whopping $64,000 on","Read more Fueled by consumers rising interest in cryptocurrencies and institutional buyers, bitcoin has touched an all-time high value of a whopping $64,000 on Wednesday, ahead of Coinbases IPO debut. Data from Coinmarketcap.comshows that an unprecedented rally of Bitcoin value has propelled its market cap over a whopping $1.2 trillion. What makes the achievement more significant is the duration it has taken to touch $1 trillion market cap. Bitcoins outstanding performance made the cryptocurrency taking far lesser timethan other mainstream financial assets to hit the $1 trillion milestone. Advertisements According to a study conducted by CryptoParrot, Bitcoin, the worlds most popular cryptocurrency, was able to reach this record peak in the span of mere 12 years only, while other large-cap U.S tech companies took way longer. Source: visualcapitalist.com Microsoft was 3.6x slower than BTC, as it took close to 44 years to get to $1 trillion. The Cupertino-based tech giant Apple took 42 years to achieve the same milestone while the U.S e-commerce behemoth Amazon Inc took 24 years and Alphabet-owned Google took 21 years. CryptoParrots report further highlights that even though the technology stocks have surged to a big extent from last year, none of them was able to match or outperform bitcoins growth trajectory. Thus, it is very much possible that in the near future, BTCs market cap will surpass that of other mainstream assets as well, given it has already sped past that of Tesla. Another research report by Glassnode, a blockchain data provider, said that bitcoin has held the $1 trillion market cap for more than a week. Therefore, it displays a strong vote of confidence for bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency asset class as a whole. It is important to note that bitcoin, at the beginning of 2021, had a more modest market cap of only $500 billion, but from thereon, it went to gain another $500 billion. Advertisements So, which were the key events that contributed to BTCs viral growth? Both Elon Muskand Jack Dorseymade sizable investments in bitcoin via Tesla and Square. Teslas 1.5 billion bitcoin investment is pegged to have reaped the company bigger profits than what it earned from its entire business in 2020. Canadian government regulators approvedmultiple bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds, aka ETF. Several ETFs were launched on the Toronto Stock Exchange, aka TSX. For many years, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBT) was the only investment vehicle accessible to investors. Last but not least, major payment processors such as MasterCardand Visa along with Bank of New York Mellon, made announcements about making it easier for their customers to use cryptocurrencies for making purchases. The skyrocketing value of Bitcoin has boosted the confidence of investors as well as traders despite possible backslash it may face in some of the largest markets. India, one of the largest markets, is reportedlylevying a heavy tax on Bitcoin exchanges and trading as well. Few either countries are also closely monitoring the market conditions before making their final move. It now remains to be seen how further and at what speed bitcoins market cap grows from here onward. We will keep you updated. Until then, stay tuned.

Do you think that the digital currency has a future, after all?","Dec 21, 2013 at 11:14AM Dear readers, Let me tell you a little story. Once upon a time there was Bitcoin, a virtual currency that many people thought would change the way we think about money. But one day, China forced BTC, one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges worldwide, to stop accepting new fiat deposits. That was, more or less, the end of Bitcoin. And we lived happily ever after. Or not? Do you have another ending to this story? The December 2013 Meltdown Earlier this month, Bitcoin topped out at around $1,200, a move triggered mainly by all the hype that surrounded the recent Congressional hearing on virtual currencies. In a letter addressed to senators, Ben Bernanke gave his cautious blessing to Bitcoin, saying that virtual currencies may hold long-term promise. Instantly, this love-it-or-hate-it digital cash went through the roof. But when China's central bank scored a bull's eye on the crypto-currency by barring financial institutions and payment companies from handling Bitcoin transactions, a cloud on the horizon appeared. The oldest and largest Bitcoin exchange in the country was forced to stop accepting new yuan deposits. Bitcoin dropped like a rock and lost around 50% of its value. Frankly, I don't think this meltdown is that big of a deal. As Business Insider contributor Mark Williams aptly points out, ""in Bitcoin world, a week can be the equivalent of a decade."" I can't enumerate exactly how many times over the past four years Bitcoin took traders on a roller coaster ride by tripling in value, only to plummet a couple of weeks or even days later. Even so, this time is different because China  a global economic superpower  is standing up to it. And BTC China accounted for nearly one-third of the world's transactions denominated in Bitcoins. So, is this the beginning of the end for the world's most controversial digital cash? Bitcoin 'opponents' around the globe China is not the only country to frown on this decentralized crypto-currency. Regulators in Europe seem very keen on drafting new rules aiming at preventing virtual currencies from making their way into the mainstream. Last week, the European Banking Authority raised a red flag over the risks that stem from virtual currencies' extreme volatility and urged consumers to steer clear of them. Authorities in France also took a stand against Bitcoin.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-14 08:50:00,This Top Tech Investor Believes Bitcoins Will Beat Apple Pay -- The Motley Fool,Marc Andreessen believes bitcoins will eventually win out over Apple Pay in the next 20 years. But is he comparing apples to oranges?,"Mike Cauldwell Bitcoin is also the antithesis of fiat currencies, which have values set by the government, instead of being pinned to underlying assets like gold. Like a natural resource, there is a finite amount of bitcoins that can be digitally ""mined"" with an algorithm. This means bitcoins could become more dependable than even major currencies like the Russian ruble. Apple Pay is also ultimately limited to a single platform, iOS, while bitcoins can be transferred from nearly any Internet-connected device. Apple Pay is also fenced in by the legal boundaries of financial institutions and retailers, but bitcoin can cross international borders with ease. Why Andreessen might be wrong As of this writing, a single bitcoin is worth $216 -- down from over $1,100 in December 2013 but sharply up from around $4 in December 2011. That level of volatility makes it impossible to gauge their true value. Back in 2010, a Florida programmer paid for two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoins -- that would be worth a whopping $2.16 million today. Licensed exchanges like Coinbase might stabilize the price, but unless the annual gains or losses cool down to the single digits, it is hard to see businesses accepting bitcoin as readily as Apple Pay. Moreover, since retailers need to eventually convert bitcoin to local currencies, bitcoin ends up pinned to local currencies anyway. Apple Pay, while not as ""entirely new"" as Cook claims, still advances mobile payments to the next level by replacing cumbersome PIN codes with Touch ID on iPhones. On the upcoming Apple Watch, the PIN code only needs to be entered once, then remains active as long as the watch is worn by a single user. That big difference, along with a rising market share and the 220,000 stores that have adopted Apple Pay, ensure that it will fare better than earlier effortslike Google Wallet or Softcard. Apple Pay on the iPhone and Apple Watch. Source: Apple Apple Pay also offers a similar layer of anonymity as bitcoin, sending a token and dynamic number through the merchant network, instead of revealing credit card details. Add that to its Touch ID security, and Apple Pay arguably addresses data breach concerns just as well as bitcoin transfers. Why Apple wins by playing by the rules The ideology of bitcoin -- to declare independence from fiat currencies as a cryptocurrency without borders -- sounds revolutionary. Unfortunately, it is also prone to devastating hacks like Mt. Gox remains extremely volatile, and ignores user habits and retailer needs. By comparison, Apple Pay works by simplifying and securing mobile payments for users, addressing retailer needs, and inking partnerships with financial institutions. In my opinion, those steps will turn Apple Pay into a mainstream payment system as bitcoin remains a niche concept for hackers, programmers, and retailers seeking publicity Leo Sun owns shares of Apple and Facebook.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-14 07:38:00,5 Factors That Could Cause Bitcoin's Bubble to Burst -- The Motley Fool,"After more than quadrupling year to date, bitcoin's fun in the sun may be running out.",") Sep 14, 2017 at 8:38AM Traditionally, no investment has been able to hold a candle to the stock market when it comes to real wealth creation. However, cryptocurrencies aren't your traditional investment. This year alone, the aggregate market value of cryptocurrencies has soared by more than 800% surpassing $160 billion at one point, with bitcoin, the most consumer- and investor-facing digital currency of the group, nearly touching $5,000 per coin at the beginning of September after beginning the year below $1,000 a coin. While bitcoin's near quintupling might seem impressive, other cryptocurrencies, like primary rival ethereum, have risen by more than 3,500% year to date. Image source: Getty Images. Why digital currencies have been unstoppable in 2017 What's lit a fire under cryptocurrencies in 2017? Potentially the biggest catalyst has been the plummeting U.S. dollar, which recently hit a two-and-a-half year low. Generally, the dollar falls when uncertainty rises with regard to the U.S. economy. A lack of progress from the Trump administration in getting major legislation passed clearly has investors concerned that U.S. GDP growth forecasts may be a bit overzealous. When the dollar falls, the usual response from investors is to seek the safety of gold. Gold has been used as a currency for centuries, and it's a finite resource, which allows it to be a presumed store of value when the dollar is falling. However, in recent months, we've likely seen some investors choosing bitcoin as opposed to gold as their safe-haven investment. Bitcoin's protocol limits the number of coins that can be mined to 21 million, which itself makes bitcoin somewhat of a finite resource. The blockchain that a number of cryptocurrencies are based on, including bitcoin, could be another fundamental reason for this ferocious rally. Blockchain is a digital decentralized ledger that keeps track of all transactions. It's considered to be exceptionally secure, and some pundits believe it could be the future of peer-to-peer, client-to-business, and business-to-business transactions. In fact, more than 150 organizationsare currently testing versions of ethereum's blockchain in various pilot and small-scale programs in the financial and energy sectors, to name a few. Image source: Getty Images. If the bitcoin bubble bursts, one of these factors will likely be the culprit While the run higher in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has been game-changing, it's also feasible that bitcoin could be in bubble territory. After all, bitcoin's market cap has surged from roughly $3 billion in 2015 to nearly $69 billion as of Sept. 9, 2017. Though it's impossible to pinpoint what, if anything, could cause bitcoin's bubble to burst, the following five factors appear to be its most likely downside catalysts. 1. The emotional trading tide turns Perhaps the biggest risk for bitcoin is that the upside momentum wanes among retail investors and they lock in their gains. Because bitcoin is considered a nontraditional asset, most institutional investors have avoided taking a position in the digital currency. Thus, retail investors have been determining bitcoin's price -- and retail investors are considerably more prone to make decisions based on emotions rather than logic. It wouldn't take much to strike fear into bitcoin investors and send them scurrying for the exit. 2. Brand-name businesses ditch digital currencies, including bitcoin Another way bitcoin's bubble could burst is if brand-name and high-profile businesses suddenly decide that they don't want to accept the digital currency. Five brand-name businesses have accepted bitcoin since 2014 but if volatility in the currency grows, or if bitcoin's price were to suddenly falter, it's not out of the question that businesses could stop accepting bitcoin altogether. The fact that dozens of businesses accept bitcoin as payment adds to its legitimacy, so if businesses were to renege on their pledge to accept bitcoin, it could devastate what's often been described as a libertarian's dream currency. Image source: Getty Images. 3. Bitcoin's blockchain loses out to a competitor The bitcoin bubble could also burst if its blockchain turns out to be far less popular than envisioned by investors. As noted, ethereum already has an alliance of more than 150 organizations that believe its blockchain could be the next big thing. For what it's worth, bitcoin recently completed its SegWit2X upgrade that's designed to reduce transaction fees, improve transaction speeds, and increase capacity within its network (this upgrade is what precipitated the split of bitcoin into two currencies bitcoin and bitcoin cash). Will that be enough to attract businesses? It remains to be seen. 4. Bitfinex is hit by a major cyberattack If the largest bitcoin exchange were hit by a cyberattack, bitcoin could be in deep trouble. Currently, that title goes to Bitfinex, which, according to trading volume data found on WorldCoinIndex.com, shows it handles about half of all of bitcoin's volume in a given day. For those who may not recall, Mt. Gox at one time handled about 70% of bitcoin's trading volume before a cyberattack completely decimated the exchange. After bitcoin and cash were allegedly stolen by hackers, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy. This doesn't in any way suggest that Bitfinex is susceptible to cyberattacks to the same extent Mt. Gox was, but a debilitating cyberattack on Bitfinex, which could seriously hurt bitcoin's liquidity, can't be discounted. Image source: Getty Images. 5. Regulators crack down on bitcoin Finally, it's always possible that increased regulatory action could cause bitcoin's price to plunge. Unlike the other factors, this last point could potentially be a double-edged sword. You could rightly argue that increased regulation is a good thing since it would validate bitcoin as a currency and help keep bad folks from tarnishing the digital currency's reputation. Then again, increased regulation would be a major blow to libertarians who want zero government involvement in bitcoin. In other words, it could reduce interest in bitcoin, thus hurting its price. As noted, it's impossible to know with certainty if bitcoin is in a bubble. However, if my arm were twisted, I would indeed suggest the criteria for a bubble exists, and that buyers of bitcoin be fully aware of the major risks they're taking.

One can invest in bitcoins using So, are you ready to get rid of these misconceptions? Bitcoins and anonymity Well, if people tell you that bitcoins are completely anonymous, you dont need to trust them. It may seem that bitcoins are anonymous when you use them initially, but you need to be very clear that bitcoins are not 100% anonymous. The blockchain technology that runs the bitcoin is made on a public network. Thus, anyone can know the transactions that you are making in bitcoin. If a person has deep knowledge and understanding, he/she can decode your spending and income in bitcoin. Thus, frankly speaking, bitcoins are pseudo-anonymous. This means that is it not 100% anonymous, but it offers high levels of anonymity as compared to the use of traditional currencies. The bitcoin system is made private, and thus, it can be quite difficult for an observer to know exactly what you are doing with bitcoins. But, as per many studies, it is being said that the future innovation in technology and upgradation in bitcoin technology can make it quite difficult for anyone to get even a single detail about the use of bitcoins. Is bitcoin a scam? Well, this is one of the biggest misconceptions about bitcoins. Every day, you may hear that bitcoin is a scam, and you should not make an investment. No doubt, many people are duped on the pretext of making an investment in bitcoins. But, if you pay close attention and if you keep your eyes and ears open, you will know that bitcoin is not a scam. Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not controlled by anyone. Many people called bitcoin to be a new type of pyramid scheme. But, there is no truth in all these versions. As a currency, bitcoin works in the same way as other currencies, and its just that it uses a digital format of usage and investment. There are certain loopholes associated with bitcoins, but it does not mean that bitcoin is a total scam. Bitcoin has been in the news for all wrong reasons, but you cant call it a scam.

You should note that just buying and selling bitcoins is not enough. You also need to give maximum attention so that your bitcoins are stored in a safe place. These days you might have heard the news about many bitcoin wallets getting hacked. Many hacking and spamming activities put your bitcoin wallets under threat. For people who want to keep their hard-earned bitcoins safe and secure, it is important to have a wallet that is well-equipped with technological advancements. For safety and security purposes, investors are keeping their bitcoins in different types of online, offline, hardware, and software wallets. Different wallets have different advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we will try to pay attention to the major advantages offered by the mobile-based bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin has gone through a large scale YuanPay Group and it is important for people to understand the importance of a good quality bitcoin wallet. When choosing a good quality bitcoin wallet, it is important for people to understand that a bitcoin wallet should be such that it can be easily used by beginners as well as pro users alike. No doubt, offline bitcoin wallets are considered to offer better levels of safety and security, but if you are looking for convenience of operation, a mobile wallet should be your preferred choice. If you have never used a bitcoin mobile wallet, you should know that it comes up with different advantages. Knowing about these advantages will help you in making better choices. Some of the major benefits of bitcoin wallets include accessibility, faster and quicker transactions, and also a safe and secure trading platform. Some of the major reasons why you should use bitcoin mobile wallets include: Ease of access If you are someone who remains glued to mobile devices consistently, the use of a mobile wallet can be the best option for you. By using the mobile wallet, you can keep on checking the status of your bitcoin every minute. Thus, you can get real-time data and information about your bitcoins by using a mobile wallet. Another important advantage of the mobile wallet is that it can help you in making the payment quickly and conveniently as the mobile stays with you 24X7. You can buy a cup of coffee or a diamond ring for your partner whenever you need it. All you need is a shop or an online store that can accept payment in bitcoins. Better security Better levels of security is another important reason that makes bitcoin a good option. As compared to other wallets, bitcoin mobile wallets offer better security as you will have access to your mobile all the time. Thus, unless you use an unsafe internet connection, there is no reason possible that your bitcoin wallet will be at threat. In addition to this, if the wallet privacy code is strong, there is no way possible that anyone else will get access to your mobile wallet. Your mobile phones use a different protocol called the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The best part about TEE is that it includes private keys that cant be broken by hackers and spammers. Thus, your bitcoin wallets offer you a high level of security that cant get surpassed by even hackers and spammers. Ease of use Another important benefit of using a mobile wallet is that it is quite easy to use. You can use it in any shop or store you want. All you need is access to your mobile phone and the password, and you can get it. The mobile wallets are protected in two ways, one with your regular mobile password and the other with the security key of the wallet you are using. Tech-savvy system For the millennials, mobile bitcoin wallets are a great choice as they can be used by tech-savvy people with maximum ease. The choice of a good bitcoin definitely depends upon you.

investing,NotProvided,2021-04-14 00:00:00,2021s top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest By BTC Peers,2021s top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest,"2021s top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest The crypto derivatives market has grown by leaps and bounds in 2021, with digital assets exchange platforms reporting record-high trading activities. Notably, the growth of the derivatives market is exemplified by the growing demand for Bitcoin futures contracts. The global open contract, which was worth $3 billion back in January 2020, has surpassed the $22 billion mark, according to skew.com. With this in mind, it has become necessary to evaluate the explosiveness of the crypto derivatives market by analyzing the shares of digital asset exchanges using open interest as the standard measure. Note that we have opted for open interest metrics because it paints a clearer picture of trading activities and it provides an accurate means of measuring the flow of money into a derivatives market. Here are the top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest. OKExLaunched in 2017, OKEx remains one of the oldest and most reputable crypto exchanges. Over the years, OKEx has adapted to emerging trends and has continued to feature prominently in the top echelon of the crypto exchange market. The exchange offers traders a variety of ways to engage with the crypto market, including a budding derivatives market, and other crypto finance offerings. For the better part of 2020, OKEx emerged as the largest crypto derivatives exchange as a result of its competitive derivatives products and fees. With OKEx, traders can access perpetual contracts, futures, and options all on one platform. As a result, OKEx has maintained its high-flying status, regardless of the emergence of formidable competitors in 2021. According to data from The Block, OKEx accounts for 13.79% of global open interest for BTC futures worth over $3 billion and averages 24-hour futures open interest worth $4 billion. As such, it is currently the 3rd biggest Bitcoin futures exchange globally. BinanceBinance is popularly known for its strategic listings and relatively low fees. Remarkably, the exchange has managed to replicate this formula in its derivatives market to great effects. Earlier this year, Binance stamped its dominance in the BTC futures market by accounting for over $4 billion worth of open interest equivalent to 18.22% of the global tally. The 24-hour open interest of Binances futures is currently above $9 billion. One of the compelling selling points of Binance is its low trading fees set at 0.02% and 0.04% for maker and taker fees respectively. Also, traders get to access up to 125X leverage, depending on their affinity for risks. These features, combined with the established status of Binance in the spot trading market, have propelled its derivatives products to success. BybitBybit has carved a name for itself in the crypto derivatives market in just under 3 years of operations. The exchange currently averages 24-hour trading volume worth $20 billion and accounts for 15.66%, or $3.59 billion, of the global tally of open interest for BTC futures. At the time of writing, the 24-hour open interest of its futures market is around $4.3 billion. The rise of the Asia-based exchange in the global rankings indicates the growth of retail participation in the crypto derivatives market. 70% of Bybits clientele are reportedly retail traders while the other 30% are institutional accounts. Another propelling factor might be its referral program launched in January 2021. Bybit pays a $10 bonus to new and existing users participating in the referral scheme as part of its ongoing growth inducement strategies. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)Dubbed the ideal option for institutional investors interested in crypto derivative products, CME remains one of the contributing factors to crypto mainstream adoption. Its existing status in the traditional finance terrain has played a pivotal role in its growing dominance in the crypto derivatives market. The exchange momentarily emerged as the largest bitcoin futures exchange in December only to slip to 4th place following the explosive rise of the market shares of OKEx, Binance, and Bybit. It is also worth mentioning that the crypto derivatives trading activities recorded on CME reflect the demand for crypto products by institutional traders. However, this notion might become redundant in the coming months as CME plans to launch Micro Bitcoin futures suitable for retail clients. Huobi GlobalMuch like the exchanges listed above, Huobi delivers a wide array of trading options that are available globally. Huobis growing appeal boils down to its capacity to process high volumes of trades without worrying about slippages. It has ensured that this same high level of liquidity reflects in its derivatives market as the exchange records an average trading volume of $22 billion. Also, it has its standard maker and taker fees set at 0.02% and 0.04% respectively. In terms of open interest, Huobi ranks as the 5th largest Bitcoin futures exchange, according to the data from skew.com. The exchange currently boasts an open interest of $2.4 billion for BTC futures, representing 10.79% of the global Bitcoin futures market. DeribitDeribit is another high flyer in the emerging crypto derivatives market. Like Bybit, Deribit is one of the few prominent exchanges that focus solely on providing crypto derivatives products. Note that Deribit features just 33 Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives products. Nonetheless, it remains one of the most prominent options for both retail and institutional traders. Besides, the possibility of opening anonymous accounts makes it appealing to privacy-focused traders. According to Coingecko, Deribit processes over $1 billion worth of trading volume daily, thereby cementing its place in the top 10 list of crypto derivatives exchanges by volume. More importantly, it accounts for $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin-futures open interest and averages $1.8 billion 24-hour open interest. Therefore, Deribit is the 7th on the list of the top 10 bitcoin futures market and top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest. FTXWith its 24-hour open interest averaging $5.2 billion, FTX provides sophisticated trading tools for over 150 perpetual and quarterly futures markets. Although it is a relatively new exchange, it has positioned itself for unprecedented growth by delivering consumer-centric and innovative products ranging from the basic to the highly technical. For example, Move, one of its derivative products, allows users to speculate on the daily, weekly, or even quarterly changes in the price of cryptocurrencies. As a result of FTXs penchant for innovation, the exchange has emerged as the 6th largest Bitcoin futures exchange globally, accounting for over 10% of the global bitcoin-futures open interest of $22 billion. BitmexOnce the largest crypto derivative exchange, Bitmex excelled as one of the long-standing privacy-focused crypto derivatives markets available globally. However, due to the increased regulatory scrutiny, Bitmex has begun to enforce KYC require",http://investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/2021s-top-10-crypto-derivatives-exchanges-by-open-interest-2473837
