Under the plans announced at a Dubai Museum of the Future Foundation event today, block chain  a distributed database list system designed to prevent tampering and revision  will be used by several prominent entities in the emirate including healthcare providers, Dubai International Financial Centre and Dubai Multi Commodities Centre. The move follows the formation of the Global Blockchain Council by DMFF in February. The first to be announced by local telecoms provider du will see patient healthcare records made directly accessible to doctors in the emirate using the blockchain system. The initiative is designed to prevent mistakes, make sure doctors have access to the most up to date records and reduce the need for patients to carry their own paperwork. Elsewhere, Dubai Multi Commodities Centre said it planned to combine the Kimberly Process initiative with a blockchain record system to combat the trade of conflict diamonds.  The free zone also plans to digitise the transfer, storage, and trade data provided by each country on diamond transactions. DMCC director of business development James Bernard said this data would be immediately visible to everyone across the world, limit risk and vastly reduce the costs and complexity of current systems by creating a permanent database. The DIFC initiative will see the free zone preserve and record wills and trusts in a blockchain system designed to streamline the succession process for family businesses and expatriates. Meanwhile, loyalty and rewards platform Loyalty plans to create a customised programme for Dubai enabling users to collect points and spend them at various attractions in the emirate, to create a more customised tourism experience. Other initiatives will see technology company IBM work with local companies, including logistics providers and an investment bank, to digitise and record trade flows and fintech start-up BitOasis said it was working with free zones to simplify the process of setting up a company in the emirate. It is using a blockchain system to digitally verify records and keep track of paperwork with the intention of speeding up the licensing process. The pilot projects are the first that are ready to be announced to the public but there are several others in the works, according to Museum of the Future Foundation chief operating officer Dr Noah Raford. They are scheduled for completion within three to six months with the intention of reflecting on their success after a year. Blockchain was originally designed as a digital ledger to record every bitcoin transaction that ever occurred. However, there is a growing realisation in the technology community that it may have applications beyond the cryptocurrency. IBM Clouds chief technology officer Anthony Butler said the technology had some interesting use cases and could change the way people interact with each other. Its applications are still being explored and there is a risk it is being overhyped, according to fintech company ANX Internationals chief operating officer David Chapman, who warned that many blockchain initiatives had failed to last 12 months. But, through its support, Dubai is hoping to position itself at the forefront of financial technology. Beco Capital managing partner Alvaro Abella said blockchain had enormous potential to facilitate trade in areas like Jebel Ali Port, particularly with the support of the Dubai government. Dubai is providing an example of what other governments should be doing to support the development of blockchain, he said.",https://gulfbusiness.com/dubai-backs-bitcoin-technology-blockchain-new-initiatives/
forbes,NotProvided,2016-05-26 23:00:00,How Blockchain Technology Could Change The World,Theres a lot of hype in the air about blockchain technology at the moment. A recent World Economic Forum report predicts that by 2025 10% of GDP will be stored on blockchains or blockchain related technology. This means its probably something which everyone involved in business should take notice of. [...],"Kevin Durants Business Partner Rich Kleiman On How Star Athletes Are Handling The Coronavirus Crisis. Worldwide, the financial services market is the largest sector of industry by market capitalization. If blockchain technology can replace just a fraction of that by enabling peer-to-peer transactions in other sectors then it clearly has the potential to create huge efficiencies. The technology was initially pushed into the headlines several years ago thanks to the virtual currency Bitcoin. The value of one unit of the currency (which is underpinned by blockchain technology) rose from pennies to over $1,000 between 2011 and 2013, making a handful of early adopter enthusiasts very wealthy. Of course, this generated press interest. Since then, while Bitcoins value may have fallen and the currency established a more stable rate of growth, the buzz around the blockchain concept has intensified. Blockchain technology (source: Shutterstock) IBM , Microsoftand many others have announced services based on blockchain technology. Unsurprisingly, at the moment these are mainly aimed at financial services clients. It may represent the threat of extreme disruption to their industry  but of course they will still attempt to capitalize on it  thats what they do, after all! Last month Indian tech giant Infosys announced the launchof its own blockchain based service saying that they had received interest from almost every single one of their large customers. Major banks including Bank of America Barclaysand Morgan Stanleyhave also publicly spoken about their involvement and taken part in trials. In fact, 25 major banks last year announced their commitment to the R3 CEV initiative, designed in investigate blockchains potential use in finance. Distributed ledger But how exactly does it work? I think this is where its worth returning to the phrase internet of value. The regular internet allows anyone to publish information to anywhere in the world. A blockchain (and there are many individual ones  both public and private, just as with websites) allows anyone to send value anywhere in the world where the blockchain file can be accessed. Each chain is essentially just an online database, stored in a distributed, peer-to-peer fashion among its users. Cryptography ensures that users can only edit the parts of the blockchain that they own  by possessing the private keys necessary to write to the file. It also ensures that everyones copy of the distributed blockchain is kept in synch. In the most common model, distributed processing power, drawn from users of the blockchain, is used to fuel the cryptographic systems needed to do all of the leg work. By giving private keys which you own to someone else, you effectively transfer the value of whatever is stored in that section of the blockchain. To give the easiest example - Bitcoin - keys can be used to access addresses which contain units of currency with financial value. This fills the first of three crucial roles  recording of transfers - traditionally carried out, at great expense, by the financial services industry. It also fills the second key role  establishing trust and identity. No one can edit a blockchain without owning the corresponding keys. Cryptographic checks are carried out whenever anyone tries, and edits which are not verified across the network are not accepted. Of course, the keys  just like gold, or cash - can theoretically be stolen. However, a few bytes of computer code can usually be kept secure at relatively little expense. Essentially this means that the work carried out by legions of staff in offices of banks, to record transactions, verify identities and prevent fraud, can now be carried out far more quickly and accurately by pure mathematics. Human fallibility is taken out of the equation. Smart Contracts In my opinion, though, its the third crucial role  the establishing (and verifying) of contracts  where blockchain offers the most exciting possibilities. And its also where the value of this type of technology becomes apparent outside of financial services. The ability to securely read and write to a distributed ledger, governed by mathematics and consensus rather than the whims of a centralized operator, has a whole heap of potential in just about every other industry. The key here is that as well as something as basic as an indicator of value (as with Bitcoin), blockchains can be used to store any kind of digital information, including computer code. This code can be programmed to execute when two or more parties enter their keys  meaning that everyone agrees that a contract has been filled. It can also read from external data feeds  stock prices, weather reports, news headlines, or anything else that can be parsed by computer code  to create contracts which automatically sign off when stated conditions are filled. These are known as smart contracts. Obviously the potential here is limitless. Applications could be developed which allow businesses to validate transfers based on delivery of service  for example a certain number of buying orders would signal to the blockchain-based smart contract that conditions had been filled for an invoice to be paid. The payment could then be made automatically through a blockchain based payment system. App ecosystems are already evolving, based around platforms such as Ethereumwhich aim to give businesses the toolsets necessary to get involved.  One theory even suggests that blockchain tech will provide the value fuel for the Internet of Things. Devices in the home and across industry could automatically pay for the energy they use by writing to the relevant blockchain, creating a transfer of value based on the precise usage of the device. One project involves the creation of smart local power gridsbased on distributed blockchain technology. Of particular use in remote communities, such systems would allow the distribution, metering and billing of electricity to be administered within the community itself, rather than being reliant on external multinational power and finance institutions. Another, ascribe aims to use blockchain tech to solve intellectual property issues in the digital age. Blockchains can be used to create a permanent or transferable link between the owner and a piece of IP, handle licensing issues, and even create limited editions of digital information, securely limiting the amount of times a piece of information (for example an artwork) can be displayed, shared or copied. There are, as I previously said, an almost limitless number of applications for the technology. Fraud-resistant voting systems to be put in place, where the owner of one private key is assigned one vote, and no third party referee is necessary. Censorship-resistant distribution of information. Decentralized reputation and recommendation engines, provably free of interference from intermediaries such as moderators or advertisers. In my opinion, blockchain technology looks set to be one of the most imp",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/05/27/how-blockchain-technology-could-change-the-world/

Learn how these mechanisms will change everything,"Understand how the internet began and enabled the Peer-to-peer communication, leading to the creation of Bitcoins and Blockchain, a financial technology (fintech) that promises to make a splash. A bit of history The internet, an essential part of our everyday lives, had its origins in the end of the 70s with an innovative concept. It would be an open network infrastructure that would allow you to connect with other networks, without the presence of a government agency or centralized organization, only with the basic rules and definitions necessary to ensure communication between everyone. With the arrival of the World Wide Web (WWW), the internet gained mass appeal outside of its birth environment (military and academic), and became the large global communication network that we know today. Several requests for file exchanges and remote access emerged surrounding this open infrastructure, but at that moment in history, computers were divided into two large groups: servers and clients . The vast majority of internet users were clients accessing the information available on servers, who centralized the distribution of information over the network. Peer-to-Peer communication and fintechs This division was broken with the introduction of Peer-to-Peer communication (P2P). It is an architecture of computer networks, where each one of its points or knots functions both as a client and as a server , allowing for services and data to be shared without the need for a central server . P2P was initially created with the intent to facilitate the exchange of music over the internet. In this type of communication, the spirit of decentralization reached a new dimension: all the computers act as servers and clients, performing the exchange of information in a totally open and democratic manner. From P2P to the new fintech challenges The trend of using distribution instead of monolithic systems has allowed information networks to grow, becoming larger and more powerful. While the networks grew, P2P applications developed and awake",http://blog.mjvinnovation.com/digital-transformation/from-the-internet-to-the-blockchain

Thorkild Grothe-Mller founder,"May 22, 2016 New Experiment Allows You to Play Monopoly on the Blockchain Just recently, a new study has been revealed using blockchain technologyand the popular Parker Brothers board game Monopoly. In his study, Blocktech IVS founder and CEO mixes innovative protocols with a classic board game that operates on the principles of basic economics. Also read: Using Blockchain Tech with Monopoly Gives Researchers Informative Data On May 22nd, 2016, Grothe-Mller published a video of his proof-of-concept that applies distributed ledger technology and the board game Monopoly. Grothe-Mller operates his startup Blocktech IVS, which delivers services within the area of blockchain applications and solutions. The company, Grothe-Mller states, is trying to bridge the gap between technology and needs in the real world. This particular testing has applied blockchain techniquesto Monopoly,andoffers a realistic examination. Grothe-Mller explains that the board game observation serves two purposes: Tool for everyone to understand the concept, potential, and limitations of the blockchain technology Workbench for experimentation, demonstration and test of solutions The Blocktech IVS Monopoly Proof-of-Concept In the video, Grothe-Mller describes the technical applications used in the process of this experimentation. The vision is a multiplayer gamerunning on a web browser that stores transactions and smart contracts on a distributed ledger platform. When playing the Monopoly scheme, the blockchain records titles, building ownership, and money throughout  giving insight to all moves played. They chose to use the popular Parker Brothers game because the rules are known by most everyone. Grothe-Mller says that the game also reflects real economic situations, and is the perfect testing ground for trying blockchain technology. Some of the scenarios the project supports include: User-identity of players Link real-world objects into a blockchain  Selling and Buying Smart-contracts for Escrow Supply-chain-management Grothe-Mller says the developers have a running prototype working with the Monopoly game. He says that, with this proof-of-concept, the Blocktech IVS team has gained a wealth of experience and knowledge throughout the experimentation. The working prototype is built on the Ethereum blockchainwith Microsoft Visual Studioand its Solidity add-on. The combination of these technologies is used to compile and deploy contracts throughout the game. The project services also run on NodeJS, BlockApps Strato, and Web3 platforms. The Monopoly Game tethers to the Ethereum Blockchain Grothe-Mller gives a full demonstration on a Windows virtual environment and syncs up the platform with an Ethereumnode. After the blockchain is connected, the game is booted up on the BlockApps framework, allowing the Monopoly app to run on a web browser. Users sign up with a public/private key based on the Ethereum blockchain and each player is given theirown profile. Within this interface, user data stores real-estate property titles, Monopoly dollars (MOD) and statistics throughout the gameplay.

economist,NotProvided,2016-05-21 00:00:00,Science and technology,Blockchain technology could improve the reliability of medical trials,"WhatsApp CLINICAL trials are a murky old world. The pharmaceutical industry is keen to get new drugs to market and researchers are just as keen to report positive results. This can produce some rather unpleasant side-effects. Selective reporting of data from trials is rife. In one infamous example, a 2001 study reported that paroxetine, an antidepressant, was safe and effective for treating the illness in teenagers. It later emerged, however, that this was based on new measures of the drugs effectiveness, introduced only after the drug had failed to show any significant improvement in the outcomes that had been specified when the trial was first drawn up. Later studies showed that the drug increased the risk of suicidal behaviour in children. How to guard against such things got Greg Irving, a family doctor and a researcher at the University of Cambridge, thinking. He came up with a way to improve the reporting of clinical trialswith the blockchain technology underlying bitcoin, a digital currency. The blockchain is a database that acts as a public ledger of all transactions with the currency, and is thought to be almost completely tamper-proof because it is validated and stored independently on thousands of different computers worldwide. This provides a way, Dr Irving reckons, to check that results have not been fudged. Since 2007 Americas drugs regulator has required that all clinical trials are registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, a publicly accessible database. So, Dr Irving used a recent example to demonstrate how his idea might work. He saved a copy of the study protocol, including the planned analysis and clinical outcomes it was supposed to test, to a text file. He then fed that file into an algorithm called an SHA256, which boils the data down into a unique string of characters known in cryptography as a hash. Even a small change to the original file, such as the addition of a full stop, would result in a completely different hash. (Conversely, it is impossible to use the code to reconstruct the contents of the original file.) Such strings are also used in bitcoin transactions. To add a record of the codified protocol to bitcoins public ledger, its hash must be used in a bitcoin transaction. To do that Dr Irving used the hash generated from the trial protocol as a private keyessentially a password that allows someone to spend bitcoins in his online wallet. Bitcoin users usually randomly generate a hash for the same purpose. He then transferred a small sum of money from his bitcoin wallet to a second bitcoin wallet. The transaction created a public keya second string of characters that is time-stamped and entered in the blockchains ledger. Anyone with a copy of the trial protocol should be able to reproduce the above steps to check if they resulted in the same public key. This would prove that the copy of the protocol matched the original. To show that this was the case, Dr Irving gave his protocol to John Holden, also a general practitioner, who used it successfully, the pair report in F1000Research. Though the process might seem to be convoluted, Dr Irving and Dr Holden say it took less than five minutes. Dr Irving believes the method could prevent hidden outcome switching, the egregious and statistically flawed practice of secretly changing the focus of a clinical trial to fit the results. A study last year of 137 trials found 60 reported on outcomes they were not looking for, according to their original protocol. The COMPare project, which monitors clinical trials, found only nine out of 67 studies it has so far looked at had reported their results properly. With about 20,000 studies registered each year on ClinicalTrails.gov alone, such problems are likely to be the tip of a very large iceberg, Dr Irving contends. Public keys for protocols should be uploaded to trial registries, he argues, and included in research papers. Researchers and medical journals could speedily check whether the right results were being reported. Ultimately, the process could be automated. Another benefit, paradoxically, is that the protocol for studies could be hidden until completed. This might be useful for commercially sensitive trials of new therapies. As long as the public key was uploaded to a registry when the trial began, the protocol could be verified later without the worry that it had been changed during the study. Dr Irving would now like to test his ideas on a small number of trials. And, of course, to report the results properly. Update (June 22nd 2017): On May 25th 2017 the study mentioned in this article was retracted by its authors due to concerns over unreliable methodology.

But the blockchain can help.","archives due to archaic data storage solutions being used in the past. A combination of floppy drives, CD-ROMs, and even tapes has made it impossible to recover and digitize some critical information. Given the declining usage of tapes and floppy disks, that hardly comes as a surprise. However, it also begs the question as to why these cities have only recently started digitizing their archives, as this is a problem that should have taken care of several years ago. CD-ROMs can still be read by most computers, but they are not a durable solution to store sensitive data in the long term either. Unlike what most people might come to expect, these issues affect both large and small cities. Rotterdam, Utrecht, and Eindhoven are just a few of the locations where a part of the archived data has gone missing. The used many moons ago have become unreadable, either due to hardware degradation or due to tapes rotting away. But hardware degradation is not the only issue city officials face when trying to digitize archiving,as it takes a long time to access all of the information. In fact, some of the older floppy drives require outdated versions of Microsoft Windows to make them readable, which is not a process most people are looking forward to. As a result, a lot of information is no longer accessible to citizens and officials. Additionally, some of the data cant be digitized, which means the information will go missing at some point in the future. New solutions have to be found to make the digitization process a lot smoother in the future, which is why officials need to start exploring new technologies to record current information.

morganstanley,NotProvided,2016-05-18 00:00:00,Banking with Blockchain Technology,"Explore how big banks are planning to leverage Bitcoin to streamline operations and costs, while improving services and products for their clients.","Email this Print this The code underlying Bitcoin was supposed to spell the end of traditional finance; instead, big banks plan to leverage it to streamline operations and costs, while improving services and products for clients. Ever since Bitcoin was introduced in late 2008, the blockchain code that underpins the cryptocurrency has been the source of hope and fearand much hype. In theory, agile startups could create software built on blockchain protocols with the hope of providing a safer, faster, cheaper and more transparent alternative to traditional financial intermediaries, such as banks, brokers and complex clearance processes. The opportunities, much of which is currently focused on post-trade processing, could compete with, and potentially threaten, financial incumbents. In practice, incumbent financial institutions are investing in building permissioned blockchainsa digitally distributed ledger where authorized users can record, process and verify transactionsto streamline their own operations and costs, according to a recent Morgan Stanley Researchreport, ""Global Insight: Blockchain in Banking: Disruptive Threat or Tool?"" In short, Wall Street sees an opportunity to hack its own complexities using this new tool. Blockchain technology could help banks reduce the clutter and cost of numerous complex processes say co-authors Huw van Steenis, head of European financial industry coverage, and Betsy Graseck, who covers U.S. Large Cap Banks. While broad-based adoption could take as long as a decade, exchanges, custodian and central depositories should see changes come quicker, in the next 12-18 months. The practical applications of the blockchain will take timeas well as regulatory blessings and long-term industry adoptionbut clients and investors could benefit significantly, as would the financial industry itself, via streamlined and less costly operations, as well as better products and services for customers. To deliver better efficiency and interface with other parts of the tech food chain seamlessly, an industry blockchain would have to be built simply and elegantly so that all parties can leverage and understand it. The Consortium Route The transition will likely be gradual. Expect blockchain applications to appear one asset class at a time, in an iterative process that may take as long as a decade. When change comes, it will likely come from industry consortianot startups. ""The market may underestimate the opening advantage for banks and custodians,"" says Graseck. ""If they can deliver a more streamlined process with lower costs, they will be a formidable competitor."" Through consortiums, banks are now engaged in a broad range of proofs of concept. As winning ideas emerge, expect banks and related intermediaries to agree on common standards, with regulatory support, to share the expense of building a blockchain, whether it leverages their existing infrastructure or not. Two such partnerships, the Hyperledger Project and the R3 Blockchain Consortium, each have many proofs of concept underway, attracting participation from dozens of major institutions. One of the most frequently discussed potential use cases for blockchain technology is post-trade settlement for a wide range of securities, including syndicated bank loans. Today's process is costly, with each party relying on teams of people to review, authorize, verify and potentially dispute transactions. ""Transacting parties using the same distributed ledger could have more visibility to help speed up resolution management, which should lower staff costs associated with post-trade settlement,"" van Steenis says. 10 Challenges to Adoption Plenty of hurdles stand between financial institutions and widespread blockchain adoption: Cost/benefit: Blockchains could speed financial transactions, but faster isnt always more profitable. Given the high cost of building a blockchain system, any proposed use must have a positive return on invested capital. ""The question is, can incumbents achieve increased security, speed, transparency and efficiency using enhancements, blockchain or otherwise, to existing infrastructure,"" Graseck says. Cost mutualization: If a shared blockchain were to work like an interoperable industry utility, banks would need to share the cost of building the infrastructure. Making this equitable could be challenging, given banks wide variation in size and need for customization. Aligning incentives: Not all parts of the financial food chain have the same incentives. Different entities may have conflicting priorities for a shared blockchain. But without large groups of users, blockchains wouldnt be successful. Evolving Standards: Users want to determine a standard ahead of any material investments.Too many choices could slow down adoption.Given their deeper pockets, larger competitors are in the forefront of driving the standard. Scalability: Any blockchain must scale effectively from proof-of-concept to succeed, a key reason why most new blockchain proposals are looking at a range of rules, including ones that restrict users or centralize all, or part, of the blockchain.Without these, higher energy costs could eliminate the benefits from lower personnel costs. Governance: A blockchain would need a governing body to decide who gets access to the blockchain and manages its maintenance. Regulation: The familiar challenges of regulating digital identities and cross-border standards would have to be addressed during the build-out. Legal risks: Users on a financial services blockchain must be identifiable entities, perhaps via something like a single digital passport number. Regulators would still enforce know your customer and anti-money laundering rules, regardless of the software protocol. Security: Does the blockchain offer more resilience for security? Banks will have to perform extensive research to ensure that any blockchain they implement is at least as resilient as their current infrastructure against attack. Simplicity: To deliver better efficiency and interface with other parts of the tech food chain seamlessly, an industry blockchain would have to be built simply and elegantly so that all parties can leverage and understand it. These roadblocks, while not insurmountable, show why blockchain technology most likely won't disrupt the financial industry as quickly or as completely as some expect. While financial institutions are investing in research now, adoption will be iterative, asset-class by asset-class over the next five to ten years, say van Steenis and Graseck. Even as the industry begins to adopt blockchain technology, institutions are likely to incorporate the new technology into existing systems with workarounds, instead of completely scrapping their current infrastructures for a brave new blockchain world.

How can blockchain technology help secure the supply chain? Blockchain, the ledger of transaction data most commonly associated with Bitcoin, can be used in service of supply chain management. Here's a look at how. Share this item with your network: By Published: 03 May 2016 Blockchain technology has great potential in managing supply chaindata, specifically to maintain quality and certification data, chain of-custody information, and other critical safety and regulatory information. Blockchain, which first came to public attention in conjunction with the Bitcoin digital currency, is a type of distributed database that stores a permanent and tamper-proof ledger of transaction data. A critical feature of blockchainis that control is distributed across a network of participating entities with no central server. No entity ""owns"" or controls the data. All information provided to the blockchain, which some refer to as distributed ledger technology, is authenticated through an unforgeable digital signature that allows the user to prove their identity while preventing another user from impersonating them in the future. Each computer that is connected to the chain of transactions, or node, is updated as each ""block,"" or additional transaction, is made. The data is distributed and duplicated across the network, and member computers are constantly communicating with one another, comparing data to make sure it is correct and matches previous records and is therefore valid. Many security experts believe that blockchain isunhackable and impossible to shut down because there's no central server. Blockchain technology was created to ensure secure transactions. In a traditional data processing situation, whoever controls the server controls the data. So the entire integrity of the system is dependent on that owner, or controller. If a company should decide to ""fudge"" the data for any reason, there is no assurance that the fraud would ever be detected. With blockchain no one entity is in control of the data -- control is distributed across the network. Every entry is authenticated, and all data is confirmed across the network, so it can never be altered or corrupted. The use of blockchain technology in service of supply chain managementfocuses on certification data, chain of custody and ensuring regulatory requirements are met for controlled goods like pharmaceuticals and food Blockchain technology is being actively considered for securing healthcare records, for DNA data and other personal information that is being circulated through the pharmaceutical research community and will likely become the go-to methodfor securing medical and health related supply chaindata. Food and beverage, automotive, electronics, aerospace and defense, and other communities will likely follow in their application of blockchain to secure batch and lot, quality, safety and traceability information.

In other words, the crowd keeps these cryptocurrency protocols aliv","Leave a Comment Bitcoin, the new age currency making rounds around the internet relies upon people, who are part of the network to keep it alive. In other words, the crowd keeps these cryptocurrency protocols alive by contributing processing power to the network (miners) and by executing digital currency transactions. Apart from being dependent on the crowd for its own survival, bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology have something more up their sleeves, making them invaluable for the crowdfunding industry. The blockchain technology is a perfect fit for crowdfunding applications. The decentralized nature of the digital currency technology combined with security and immutability makes it so. The main application of blockchain technology, when it was introduced along with bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto was for it to be the distributed ledger that facilitates and records each and every transaction that ever happens on the Bitcoin network. By maintaining a record of all the transactions, the blockchain prevents users from double spending their bitcoins during the confirmation phase. However, the benefits offered by blockchain technology is much beyond its use as a ledger for digital currency transactions. To list few of the benefits, Blockchain technology offers a secure platform for data storage and management, it offers universal authentication, it builds a trust factor on trust-less networks, it can be used to automate various processes, easy to audit, offers frictionless transaction capability and it offers a certain degree of anonymity. Having such a long list of benefits under its belt, Blockchain technology has grown beyond bitcoin and its use is being explored by virtually every industry. Crowdfunding is a process of raising fundsfor a project or venture from the masses, where people pool in smaller contributions/investments to create a significantly larger investment to meet the requirements. The burden of investment is distributed across the masses, so no single person has to spend more than they can spare. The concept of crowdfunding has been around for ages now. Its implementation in different ways goes back as far as the late 17th century where War Bonds were used as a method of crowdfunding. Also, there are instances where artists, authors, philosophers have crowdfunded their works. The modern day crowdfunding can be divided into few distinct types. Donations based, rewards based and equity based. While those who participate in donation-based crowdfunding campaigns do not expect in return for their contribution, it is not the same with the rest. In reward-based crowdfunding, the contributors expect certain rewards in recognition of their contributions. However, ventures opting for equity-based crowdfunding are expected to give a share of equity to its backers against their contributions. Also, certain crowdfunding campaigns on the platform have predefined goals, which if not met will leave the whole campaign void. blockchain technology is perfectly capable of managing value exchange under contract. The feature that will come handy when it comes to managing rewards based and equity-based crowdfunding campaigns. Using blockchain based smart contracts for crowdfunding, the whole process of assigning relevant rewards and equity against their contributions can be automated. By programming a set of pre-defined crowdfunding conditions on smart contracts, the system can be automated to execute the smart contract to issue certain rewards or proof of ownership of a certain percentage of equity based on the amount contributed towards the campaign. While mainstream crowdfunding campaigns are yet to pick this up, it is being implemented by the digital currency segment for their crowdsales. Crowdsales are the crowdfunding campaigns in the cryptocurrency world, where the digital currency platform sells the pre-mined crypto-tokens for the platform under development in exchange for either bitcoin, ethereum or some other established digital currency. The funds raised are then used for further development of the platform. The crypto tokens bought by the participants of the crowdsale is equivalent to both rewards and equity (depending upon the model followed by the platform). Blockchain technology and digital currencies have proven to be capable of being retrofitted to meet the needs of any industry, including the time-tested ones. Crowdfunding is one such segment, into which the technology is capable of blending in, completely.

Blockchain technology is unlike any other system currently powering currency, and as such is not properly understood by the public at large. To many, especially of the older generations, cryptocurrency can seem like magic, a trick of digital sorcery, and certainly not something upon which one would place their trust and life savings. To aid in the understanding of cryptocurrency, I will attempt to explain Bitcoin through the allegory of a pre-electricity village, without referencing any modern technology. Decentralized transaction records Our hypothetical village has no centralized currency, and instead employs a simple barter system. The villagers, tired of the inefficiency of simple barter, but wary of a central bank issuing currency, adopt a decentralized accounting system around units of measurement called VillageCoin, and write down all transfers in a public ledger. Record keepers When a citizen wishes to transfer an amount of VillageCoin to another, they write down the transaction on a piece of paper containing the sender, the recipient, the amount, and the date, and submit it into a large, secure ballot box for inclusion in the ledger. Volunteer record keepers, known henceforth simply as keepers process all transactions. Several keepers must sign off on a transaction before it can be included in the ledger in order to prevent fraud and mistakes. Transactions may also indicate a small amount of VillageCoin set aside for the keepers, with higher fees ensuring priority transactions are processed first. Public ledger Once confirmed by the keepers, all transactions are written onto scrolls which are then encased in glass. These are called blocks. Each block has etched on its head a shorthand summary of the transactions contained therein. These blocks are chained together and kept in the villages public archives, so all transactions are permanently and publicly accessible. Back to Bitcoin Bitcoin functions much in the same way as this fictional villages accounting system. Transactions between addresses containing an amount and date are submitted to the network. Instead of physical record keepers, computing systems called miners process and confirm transactions. They are paid small transaction fees, and additionally claim new Bitcoin mined into the currency supply slowly over time (with a hard limit of 21 million). All transactions end up in data blocks, which then are chained together on the blockchain as permanent and public record. The only key differences between Bitcoin and the fictional VillageCoin are the use of digital records instead of physical, transaction addresses not being tied to physical identity (no one necessarily knows who controls which address), transactions being instantaneous and easy rather than time-consuming and requiring physical materials for transcription, and Bitcoin being being a global currency (rather than being relegated to one small village). Bitcoin isnt so complicated after all When viewed through the lens of physical record-keeping, Bitcoin starts to make more sense to the average layperson. The concept of the blockchain, a public and decentralized leger, is the simple, natural conclusion of any desire to record any human activity long-term without a centralized governing body. If more understood the simple roots behind Bitcoins technological genius, currencies controlled by central banks would have been abandoned by now.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-human-blockchain-bitcoin-explained-without-technology

Gartner analysts list 7 common myths about the technology.,"email Everyones talking about the Bitcoin blockchain  a global, distributed ledger of transactions for the Bitcoin digital currency  allowing for peer-to-peer payments over the Internet. According to a Gartner definition, the Bitcoin blockchain is an authoritative record of Bitcoin transactions, and is not stored in, or controlled by, a central server. Instead, transaction data is replaced as a whole across a peer-to-peer network of thousands of coins. The Bitcoin blockchain is being applied across many industries in areas such as the Internet of Things, digital rights management, and global payments. But among all the global noise, there is some confusion around what it can and cant do. In a report published this month, Gartner analysts Ray Valdes, David Furlonger, and Fabio Chesini shared seven common myths about the Bitcoin blockchain. Myth 1: The blockchain is a magical database in the cloud The blockchain is not a general purpose database but rather it is conceptually a flat file  a linear list of simple transaction records, the analysts said in the report. This list is append only so entries are never deleted, but instead, the file (currently about 50 gigabytes), grows indefinitely and must be replicated in every node in the peer-to-peer network (thereby introducing scalability and latency issues). Myth 2: The integrity of the ledger is defined by the majority of nodes in the peer-to-peer network The reality is that its integrity is defined by the majority of hashpower (the computational resources used in data mining) not the number of distinct nodes in the network, the analysts said. This means that a single sufficiently powerful entity on the network can 'outvote' the rest of the nodes, the report said. Myth 3: The ledger represents an irrevocable record Read more PwC partners with blockchain technology company This is pragmatically correct, the analysts said, but it is theoretically possible for a party to accumulate enough hashpower to rewrite the record all the way back to the Genesis block (the first block of a blockchain). Such an action would work against the incentives of the usual participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem because it would destroy all user confidence in the blockchain technology and the commercial economy it supports, the report reads. Myth 4: Blockchain technology is scalable to the level of a global economy This is not just a myth, but more widespread perception today as people become aware of scalability issues relating to the current form of the Bitcoin technology stack, the analysts said. Due to its design, the network can only handle a relatively small number of transactions per second. Read more 5 megatrends for CIOs to watch This number is due to the constraint of a maximum block size of one megabyte, combined with around a 10-minute confirmation delay per block which, depending on the average transaction size, results in a maximum capacity of seven transactions per second (tps), the analysts said in the report. Actually, due to the increasing size of transaction records, this number has been decreasing and is now estimated at less than three tps, a small number compared to the peak capacity of, say, the Visa network at 47,000 tps or Nasdaqs potential of 1 million tps, the analysts said. Myth 5: The blockchain can be decoupled from the currency or digital token Some financial institutions considering using blockchain are saying they dont care about the currency, only the blockchain. But in its present form, bitcoin is a key part of the blockchain, the analysts said. The blockchain is simply a list of bitcoin-dominated transactions. Also, the design of the consensus mechanism relies on the currency providing the incentive for miners to confirm transactions. Read more Therefore (as some members of the bitcoin community have said), anyone who states that the currency is not important and can be ignored in favour of the blockchain, does not understand the technology and how it works, the analysts said. Myth 6: Bitcoin transactions are anonymous, instantaneous and absolute. In the bitcoin technology stack, participants in transactions are pseudonymous, the analysts said. Regarding transaction speed there is, by design, a minimum 10-minute latency in confirming transactions, and pragmatically, one could wait for an hour for confirmation. Transactions on the blockchain are probabilistic rather than absolute, in that it is theoretically possible for an attacker to build an alternative chain (a data fork) that would allow double spending. Unless the attacker has a majority of hashing power, this will not succeed. Myth 7: The blockchain is a decentralised system. The original design was a decentralised peer-to-peer network, but in practice the blockchain has become more centralised, the analysts said. The number of peer-to-peer nodes on the network has dropped steadily at about 15 per cent per year, they said. Mining is conducted in large part (about 80 per cent) by only four mining pools, which are all based in China. Any two of these four could theoretically collude and would together constitute a majority of the computational resources (hashpower) needed for mining, and could then control the updating of the distributed ledger.",https://www.goodgearguide.com.au/article/598068/7-myths-about-bitcoin-blockchain/

The technique, which removes the burden of maintaining a reliable website-based infrastructure for cybercriminals, was observed in a recent version of the CTB-Locker ransomware that targets Web servers. CTB-Locker has targeted Windows computers for a long time, but a PHP-based variant capable of infecting websites first appeared in February, marking an interesting evolution of this ransomware threat. [ Related: Microsoft Windows 10 vs. Apple macOS: 18 security features compared] The decryption routine in the original PHP-based CTB-Locker version involved a script called access.php that served as a gateway to the attackers' back-end server. This gateway script was hosted on multiple hacked websites and was necessary to obtain the decryption key after victims made a payment. The approach was not reliable, according to researchers from Web security firm Sucuri, because those hacked websites could be cleaned by their owners. Constantly updating the list of gateways used by the malware was probably a hassle for the criminals. Because of that, CTB-Locker's creators came up with a new approach: using the bitcoin blockchain itself to deliver the decryption keys. This new behavior was observed by Sucuri's researchers in a CTB-Locker version released in March. The technique relies on a field called OP_RETURN that was introduced in the Bitcoin protocol in 2014 to allow transactions to hold arbitrary bits of text, or metadata. [ Prepare to become a Certified Information Security Systems Professional with this comprehensive online course from PluralSight. Now offering a 10-day free trial!] The new CTB-Locker variant generates a unique bitcoin wallet address for every infection. Once the victim pays the ransom by sending the required amount of bitcoins to that address, the attackers generate a new bogus transaction from that same wallet to which they append the encryption key in the OP_RETURN field. The transaction is not validated in the bitcoin system, but it does get recorded in the blockchain and can be viewed through websites like blockexplorer.com and blockchain.info. The CTB-Locker script uses the blockexlorer.com API to check the transaction history for the wallet corresponding to the infection and extracts the decryption key from the bogus transaction once the payment has been made. ""So, instead of using unreliable gates on third-party hacked sites, the March version of the CTB-Locker reads the keys directly from public and much more reliable blockchain information services,"" the Sucuri researchers said in a blog post ""Thats the beauty of Bitcoin transactions -- everything is public and transparent, and at the same time its possible to keep things anonymous and not traceable to real IPs."" There are many applications that can benefit from distributed, tamper-proof systems like the blockchain, which is why the technology is being adoptedby banks and other industries.

The new Blockchain team will be based in PwCs Belfast office and is expected to grow to over 40 digital and technology specialists during 2016. The announcement comes just days after Sir Mark Walport, the UKs chief scientific adviser urged the government to adopt the blockchain technology to run key public services like tax collection, benefits or the issuing of passports. PwCs decision to focus on blockchain technology represents a major step in the firms move towards developing FinTech (financial technology) solutions that are becoming a catalyst for change and innovation in the financial services industry. Announcing the establishment of the Belfast Blockchain team, Steve Davies, PwC partner and EMEA FinTech Leader, said: Theres clear evidence that banks, institutions and even governments are looking at blockchain technology as a secure storage and distribution solution. Now there is growing interest and a real demand from our clients to help understand the implications of blockchain and how to respond to it. So, as the blockchain juggernaut continues to gather pace, PwC will be well placed to service our clients needs at a global level. PwC is now breaking new ground in developing radical FinTech solutions and these appointments represent the first stage of our plans to grow a world-class Fintech offering. We expect the initial core team of 15 experts to grow rapidly, with PwC in Belfast continuing to expand, exploit and deliver technology and digital solutions to global clients. While there is continued debate over the role of Bitcoin as a mainstream currency, the underlying blockchain technology, which consists of blocks of data in a digital ledger, is believed to be highly resistant to malicious tampering. The NASDAQ exchange is currently using a Blockchain-based system to record trades in privately held companies, while Bank of England research suggests that Blockchains could have far-reaching implications for the financial industry. The UKs technology sector is increasingly focusing on FinTech as offering radical and disruptive solutions to existing business models. The sector raised a record $3.6 billion of venture capital in 2015, with the FinTech sector accounting for almost a quarter of all investment raised by London-based tech companies. However the impact of Blockchain is still underestimated by many in the financial services industry. PwCs forthcomingGlobal Fintech survey polled 545 leading asset managers, FinTech businesses and key players in banks, fund transfer payment companies and insurers.  Only 9% of asset managers are very familiar and just under 3 in 10 are not at all familiar with blockchain, the survey will say. Welcoming the creation of the PwC Blockchain team, Ashley Unwin, PwC UK Executive Board member and UK and EMEA consulting leader, said blockchain technology could be the single greatest advance in the FinTech sector in a decade: Blockchain technology is worrying major players in the financial services industry as they dont know where it will go or its potential to disrupt business models. However, in document delivery and settlement processing alone, it will offer significant cost reduction and efficiency gains. We are confident that these disruptive FinTech technologies will trigger a huge increase in demand for blockchain expertise and we intend to be a leader in exploiting these disruptive new technologies.",https://www.the-blockchain.com/2016/04/04/pwc-launches-new-global-technology-team-to-tap-into-blockchain/

Pages Improvisation Blog Thursday, 7 April 2016 The central question behind the Block chain: What is a transaction? And how does rethinking the transaction affect our understanding of educational technologies? Block chains are records of transactions. Over the last few weeks as I've been hammering-out a bid for exploring block chain in education, I've frequently encountered the comment, ""But education isn't transactional! It's interactive!"" I've struggled to engage critics with a deeper consideration of what either ""transaction"" or ""interaction"" actually means. The point is that clarity about these words suddenly becomes really important. In reality, nobody knows what an interaction is any more than they do a transaction: I always struggled with the 'interactive' mantra of educational technology discourse from a few years back. It painted the computer as a kind facilitative medium through which actions were taken and the ""machine"" (either some AI or other kind of adaptive interface, some other person) acted back producing a kind of self-sustaining loop. This wasn't helped by certain socio-material theories which considered technology as a 'actor' without any consideration of how the technology 'actor' is identified. The fact that people would say "" It's interactive"" was a way of acknowledging the existence of an ""it"" and a process which the learner/user gets caught in. Why do we call it an ""it""? The reason for asking is that there are many social entities where we do things, things happen in return, and we get a kind of self-sustaining loop. We don't say that institutions are interactive, do we? We say ""there is a university"", ""there is a bank"" and so on. What is the ""it"" of interactivity? What I'm getting at, apart from the woolly thinking about interactivity, is that the proper topic of interactivity is the question of the identification of social entities. It is a much deeper issue about patterns of human action and the determinat",http://dailyimprovisation.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-central-question-behind-block-chain.html

Pages Saturday, 2 April 2016 The Transactional Dynamics of Personal Learning Environments Whatever the eventual result of the Block Chain hype, I suspect the lasting result will be a renewed focus on transactions in education. Thinking about the relationship between transactions and institutions has a long history dating initially from Weber, but particularly from Ronald Coase's Theory of the Firm in 1937: institutions can be thought of as the site of transactional behaviour where the firm's existence depends on the cost of its transactions being lower than they would be outside the firm. The transactional behaviour within firms can also shed light on the internal organisation of the firm and its bureaucracy. DiMaggio and Powell's classic work on institutional structures and ""institutional isomorphism"" (where the activities of management in different organisational sphere start to look the same) kick-started rethinking organisational analysis through differentiating the kinds of intra-institutional and inter-institutional transactions which characterise modern corporate life. The result of this have sometimes slipped into a confusing gap between constructivism (institutional structures are constructed through discourse) and positivism (institutions are nevertheless assumed to operate as real sites for analysis, with little questioning of their existence or legitimacy). Typical examples of approaches include Etkowitz and Leydesdorff's Triple Helix and Lounsbury, Ocasio  and Thornton's Institutional Logics. The Personal Learning Environment was originally conceived as a critique of institutional control of the resources and technologies for learning. Whilst most of what has been written about the PLE has focused on the impact of 'personal' technologies (e.g. social software, mobile devices, etc) for learning, little attention has been paid to the institution itself, and what we imagine the institution to be, and (more pertinantly) wha",http://dailyimprovisation.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-transactional-dynamics-of-personal.html

Radical Political Decentralization Could End Nation States Critical Mass Is Coming, and There May Be an Inflection Point That Excludes Firms EY provides assurance, financial audits, consulting and advisory services to companies all around the world. In its recent report on blockchaintechnology, the company explains the potential of this emerging landscape and what challenges currently preventit from reaching critical mass. The paper has a few contributors, including Angus Champion de Crespigny, Anne Freden, Paul Brody, and other EY executives. EYs Financial Services Blockchain and Distributed Infrastructure Strategy Leader Angus Champion de Crespigny explains how firms should look into this new protocol:  We recommend companies not focus on how this technology fits into their current business but instead look at what their products and services look like in a blockchain-enabled world. The multinational firm says that blockchain technology could be the right tech, at the right time meaning that, as data breaches and security loopholes are on the rise, a tamper-proof digital record will be of great importance to businesses. Alongside this, EY says distributed ledgers have brought about algorithmic trustthat could replace institutional practices with trust among peers. Additionally, it is bringing new models and markets into society, says the firm, which will arrive simultaneously with the IoT and the sharing economy, not to mention digital transformation. It has the potential to accelerate them all. Angus Champion de Crespigny On the downside, EY says that the protocol is still immature and may be too slow to scale. EY also cites PR problems regarding the blockchains association with Bitcoin which is still a controversial innovation in the financial industry. These issues could raise flags among investors or creators entering the blockchain space. Furthermore, startups and legacy institutions need imagination, early experiments, and extensive testing with R&D programs for ideas using blockchain technology to succeed. There are also debates over transparency privacy, regulatory uncertainties, and tax implications. However, to simply brush off the potentials of distributed ledgers as merely hype may not be fruitful, as Angus Champion de Crespigny explains: &ldquo;Blockchain is developing much faster than anyone expected.To think the impact to your industry is many years away is very risky. Its time to think through, in a logical, strategic way, how to effectively disrupt yourself before others do it to you. Companies should identify new blockchain-enabled opportunities, assess the risks and time their entries to capture and build competitive positions. EYs report noteshow the impact of blockchain technologyis already staking a claim within the financial sector. EY Global Chief Innovation Officer Jeff Wong says, if companies arent thinking about this now, there will suddenly come an inflection point, and then it will be too late. According to EY, startups and legacy firms should achieve readiness early by not trying to figure out their own blockchain strategies, but rather how they will operate in a world where the technology already encompasses everything. The report explains that blockchain progress will still be relatively slow at first as industry standards are hashed out between the finance and tech industries Yet, this doesnt mean that companies should sit back and watch it progress on the sidelines. EY states that, should critical mass be reached, blockchains impact will be felt far, wide and fast. What do you think about EYs thoughts on blockchain technology and critical mass?

You also almost certainly know that the technical underpinning of most of these cryptocurrencies  and Bitcoins greatest innovation  is something called the blockchain. This site and our forthcoming blog posts will explore how this innovation will disrupt industries far afield from finance, including the creative industries. But first, a quick bit of background for anyone getting up to speed on the blockchain generally. Heres what it is, in a nutshell. Distributed Trust. All successful transactions between two or more parties require some level of assurance or trust by both parties. For many financial transactions, the assurance is provided by third parties such as banks. For other types of transactions, governmental institutions may fill that role. There are other mediators of trust as well, too numerous to name. The blockchain eliminates the need for third-party-mediated trust. Transactions facilitated by blockchain technology are automatically verified by a multitude of computers owned by many parties. The transactions are recorded in a digital ledger that exists on all of those computers simultaneously; a ledger that grows with each additional transaction, and thus can be used to confirm not just the most recent transaction but all of those historically on the chain. The term blockchain derives from the fact that transactions occurring on the system during a particular timeframe are gathered into a block of transactions then placed into the chain of such blocks. For Bitcoin, its public blockchain is validated by a network of miners  computers that compete with each other to solve cryptographic puzzles and earn new Bitcoins. Other blockchain efforts may use a different system of distributed validation (that is, a different consensus mechanism). Indeed, distributed does not have to mean public; private blockchains  and even hybrid public/private blockchains  have been proposed and have been the focus of recent, intense attention from investors. Distributed Transparency. Think of a prisoner exchange on a bridge in a B-movie: the assurances are provided by an understanding that if one side tries to back out of the deal, it will be immediately apparent. Similarly, blockchain technology theoretically resists virtually all attempts to falsify or manipulate records, because the entire transactional history is, again, distributed over thousands of computers, and prior to new transactions being made the system checks that the local version of the blockchain is the same as all of the others throughout the network. One key aspect of distributed ledger technology is that the blocks in the chain can include other information, which allows a large number of additional applications to be built on top of the blockchain. Already, numerous companies are offering products that piggyback on the Bitcoin blockchain, while other companies and institutions are building their own independent blockchains. As just one example, NASDAQ is exploring blockchain technology to facilitate trades without the need for brokers and clearing houses. Instead, transactions would occur directly between parties, with lower costs and lower counter-party risk. But the possibilities are nearly endless. Of course, this oversimplifies the technology, and then some. Below are some recent explainer articles that go into a bit more depth. For a more complete understanding, try Michael Casey and Paul Vignas book The Age of Cryptocurrency. Next up: Why blockchain technology will matter to industries outside of finance.

These people tell themselves that they are redeemable, that Bitcoin is just the MySpace of cryptocurrencies, that they will have another opportunity to get in early on some other revolution. These people can be dangerous, but most of them are easily preyed upon. I think this may explain the origin of blockchain technology. It lets people talk as if clones of Bitcoin are important without having to remind themselves of Bitcoin. If someone says blockchain technology to me I give him the benefit of the doubt and write him off as someone who doesnt know what hes talking about.

Its a phrase for people who know there is a lot of money around, but dont exactly know where its coming from. I dont see that there is a lot of use for some kind of general blockchain technology outside of its application in Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, the blockchain is a way of solving the double-spending problem without privileging any party as to the creation of new units or of establishing a consistent history. This is an extremely costly and complicated way of maintaining an accounting ledger. How often do I really need to do my accountancy in this way?

To start out let us take a look at what a BitCoin is. BitCoin is a digital currency, also referred to as a cryptocurrency, were encryption techniques are utilised to verify the transfer of funds and regulate the generation of units of the currency, which is referred to as mining or more specifically BitCoin Mining. A main differentiating factor of BitCoin compared to other traditional currencies, such as the US Dollar, is that BitCoin operates independently of a central bank, which means its value is purely based on market demand and supply. The underlying technology used with BitCoin is called BlockChain. In a nutshell, a BlockChain is a distributed database that contains a continuously growing set of data record that is hardened against tampering and modification. A BlockChain is utilised for a public ledger of all BitCoin transactions. So now that the basic concepts have been explained, let us get started mining some BitCoins. Firstly you will need a BitCoin wallet to hold your BitCoins. There are various options available, falling in 3 main categories, hardware wallets, software wallets and online wallets. Do some research and see what option suits your requirements best, then set up the wallet of your choice. I used an online wallet called XAPO (www.xapo.com), which has several great features, including the ability to order a debit card linked to your BitCoin wallet. The only negative thing I experienced with XAPO is the very long verification process, which took approximately 3 weeks, before I could use my wallet. Now that we have a wallet setup and ready, we can get busy mining some BitCoins. As with the wallet there are a few options available when it comes to mining BitCoins which are contained in 2 main categories, i.e. Mining on hardware you own or Mining in the Cloud.

Angus Champion de Crespigny On Blockchain Technology and Bitcoin Bitcoinist: How did you first get involved with ? Angus Champion de Crespigny (ACdC): It was about three years ago when I read about the technology in some funny little column. It was interesting to see that it would manage to create this currency that relies solely on the internet. The more I read about it, the more it fascinated me. I was educated as a software engineer I developed a real-time cryptographic voice encryption device a master project. After that, I moved into financial services and regulatory compliance, and I started looking at the whole space. I could see that this technology was incredibly powerful, but there was a whole lot of obstacles by bringing into the real world. Its been an exciting few years learning how this technology was going to disintermediate financial services to where we are now where financial institutions are all in on this. We are still working on figuring out when that critical mass is going to hit. Thats a very brief history of how I got plugged into this technology. On the public side if theres something in the digital world that you want to prove happened there is no better place to do that then on the Bitcoin blockchain. Its the most secure network in that sense by a significant degree. Theres value in that. Bitcoinist: Do you believe legacy finance institutions are embracing blockchain because they think they may be disrupted? ACdC: I believe there is an element of that. Theres also the element of everyones looking at it and you would be silly not to as well.

The first generation of the internet created a new medium for information. The blockchain is the new medium for value and it turns out every business, institution, government and individual can benefit. How might this affect, say, the energy grid? Most homeowners, businesses and other organisations in urban areas get their power from regulated utilities at regulated prices. We have more variety in locally generated renewable energy from, for example, solar panels. The local utility captures excess power in its supply for redistribution at wholesale rates, often with considerable leakage. Read next Why too much investment in your startup can be as bad as too little By Dan de Sybel Yet the consumer, who may be located across the street from a local power source, still must go through the utility and pay full retail for renewable energy generated by their neighbour. Instead, imagine each household that has the ability to generate and store electricity can enter into peer-to-peer transactions with neighbours, or sell at market rate back into the grid. Millions of homes could become autonomous agents, contracting power automatically with the highest bidder. Blockchain technology is critical to all of this. Advertisement With potentially millions of distributed power sources, the system needs to continuously track everything, including the ability to authenticate each node in the network, to ensure its reliability. Power generation is one of dozens of ways cities will be transformed by blockchain technology and the internet of things.

Each kilometre of subway track or light rail requires thousands of man-hours, costs millions (sometimes billions) of pounds, and can cause huge disruption to daily life.

How can that excess capacity be put to work and what role will the blockchain play?

Trevor Altpeter, one of the Counterparty Foundation directors, told CoinJournal that users will have access to all features of Ethereum, noting that the only differences are Bitcoin specific such as longer block times and thus, greater security. Put simply, you hold Bitcoin, Counterparty (XCP) and Counterparty assets in the same Bitcoin address, Altpeter said. This means they all can share one private key making key management and security much easier. Running smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain has many advantages considering that it is dominant cryptocurrency in the space. Most of the uses for smart contracts rely on the ability to escrow value directly, Altpeter said. Since Bitcoin is the most valuable blockchain it is the only blockchain that currently accommodates this niche. Ethereum will have to become significantly more valuable before it would be realistic to build uses that involve escrowing value.

For the time being, this concept is not ready for real-world adoption just yet, albeit the teams have indicated future releases will make that a possibility. Given the highly confidential information to be found in certificates and academic transcripts, it is pertinent to ensure privacy is guaranteed. Learning Machine Co-Founder and CEO Chris Jagers told the media: The goal of our collaboration with the MIT Media Lab is to empower individuals with shareable credentials that can be used peer-to-peer and verified as authentic. The current system for sharing official records is slow, complicated, expensive, and broken for everyone in a myriad of ways. The first generation of students to grow up entirely during the Internet age have started applying for college, and many admissions officers can share stories about applicants trying to text photos of their academic records. The expectation, while seemingly humorous, conveys an honest impression about the way things should work. It should be that easy for people to share certified records directly with others and have them trusted as authentic. In a perfect world, learners would have full control over their official documents. But all too often, proprietary file systems  combined with framed documents and paper transcripts  seem to take over that job. In digital format, all of these documents will live on forever, without the need to store a physical copy. Verified digital credentials are the way forward, as it shifts organizing from issuers to the individual. Empowering the individual to take care of their digital belongings is an excellent way to raise awareness of what the blockchain can do. Or to be more precise, that is what an can do.

The press announcement combines two different initiatives. One is the creation of a Virtual Currency Task Force, and the other is the inclusion of virtual currency exchanges within the scope of the European Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Neither of these implies the creation of a new regulator as such. The proposal clearly states that distributed ledger technology should not be stifled by regulation at this early stage. The new task force would also be tasked with recommending any necessary legislation, but the text warns against taking a heavy-handed approach to this new technology which, it says, can offer significant opportunities for the consumer and economic development. ""To avoid stifling innovation, we favor precautionary monitoring rather than preemptive regulation. But IT innovations can spread very rapidly and become systemic. That's why we call on the commission to establish a task force to actively monitor how the technology evolves and to make timely proposals for specific regulation if, and when, the need arises,"" said von Weizscker. What we advocate in the report is not to stifle innovation by regulating now, but instead to closely monitor what is going on by the creation of a task force which we suggest should be created at the level of the commission, and then to regulate  if and when the time is right to do so and if and when the structures to do so are in place, reads the short version of Weizsckers report.

Bitcoin was last trading down 10% at $53,991 as of 1320 GMT, a whopping $12,000 below record highs set on Wednesday. Smaller rival Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, dropped 10% to $2,101. Data website CoinMarketCap cited blackout in Chinas Xinjiang region, which reportedly powers a lot of bitcoin mining, for the selloff. Luke Sully, CEO at digital asset treasury specialist Ledgermatic, said in an email that people may have sold on the news of the power outage in China and not the impact it actually had on the network. The power outage does expose a fundamental weakness; that although the Bitcoin network is decentralized the mining of it is not, Sully added. Some widely-followed blockchain analysts on Twitter pointed to a sharp drop in hash rate due to the outage. Hash rate refers to the volatility index that measures the processing capacity of the entire Bitcoin network, and it determines the power required by miners to produce new Bitcoins. Typically shocks to hash rate do not cause price drops. A hash rate reduction slows transactions, which ironically makes it harder to move coins to exchanges for sale. The recent price drop is well within the bounds of typical volatility, it is noise not signal, said Edan Yago, co-founder at Bitcoin-based decentralised finance protocol Sovryn. The retreat in Bitcoin also comes after Turkeys central bank banned the use of cryptocurrencies for purchases on Friday. Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said cryptocurrencies had been ripe for a pullback. The market has become overly aggressive and bullish on everything, said Edward Moya. It could have been any bearish headline that could have triggered this reaction. Many cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7, setting the stage for price swings at unpredictable hours. Historically, retail and day traders have driven the moves.

Dreamstime Add Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency wallet provider, to the list of companies weighing initial public offerings now that Coinbase Global has successfully navigated its trip to the public equity markets. Blockchain.com, of London, is a financial services company that is known for building crypto wallets for users to send, receive, and manage their Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, and ether. It employs about 200 people. The startup is contemplating life as a public company, according to co-founder and CEO Peter Smith. We would consider an IPO someday. But were not in a rush, Smith told Barrons. When asked about the timing of a possible Blockchain.com IPO, Smith said: Well have to wait and see. Blockchain.com is carefully considering its public-market options. Smith made the comments after Coinbase Global listed its shares earlier this week. Coinbase (ticker: COIN), the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., went public Wednesdaywith shares rising 32%. On Friday, the stock rose nearly 6% to $342, valuing Coinbase at $89.36 billion, versus a valuation of $65.3 billion at the reference price for the deal of $250. On Wednesday, Coinbases stock peaked at $429.54, valuing the exchange at $112.2 billion before dropping. The Coinbase IPO was interesting because it showed how the public markets will receive a crypto company, Smith said. Awareness of cryptocurrencies has improved, but not everyone understands them, Smith said. We havent even gotten to that point with the internet yet, he said. Crypto acceptance is better this year, and it is much improved compared with a decade ago, but we probably have a little bit further to go, he said. Blockchain.com is the latest crypto company to consider an IPO. Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange and one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges in the world, is also expected to go public Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is also said to be considering a listing. Founded in 2011, Blockchain.com has raised $500 million in funding since its founding This includes a $300 million round in Marchled by DST Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and VY Capital. The round valued Blockchain.com at $5.2 billion. Blockchain.com is looking to move beyond crypto. It provides a platform for retail and institutional clients to trade crypto while also supplying custody, clearing and settlement services. Smith wants to have foreign-currency exchange, corporate equities, options and other investment products, as well as cryptocurrencies, available on the platform by the end of 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported We just trade crypto.

Retail sales beat expectations while industrial output growth moderated.The latest data puts China on course to grow well above its annual target of more than 6%, supporting the view that China and the U.S., where economists predict 6.2% growth, will both outperform other major nations this year. Chinas recovery hasnt yet plateaued after it became the first major economy to contain the spread of coronavirus and return to growth, with GDP rising 0.6% in the first three months of 2021 from the previous quarter.How Much of Chinas GDP Was Made in America?: Daniel MossThe recovery last year was led by strong investment in real estate and infrastructure spurring demand for industrial goods, while overseas orders for medical goods and electronic devices fueled exports. Consumer spending had lagged, but the latest figures showed a turnaround. Retail sales growth was 6.3% in March when calculated on a two-year average growth basis -- which removes distortions created by last years lockdowns -- up sharply from the rates seen last year.We are seeing a bit more balanced recovery in the Chinese economy, Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS AG, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. That early pickup in construction industry is going to give way to more household consumption, she added. Consumer spending at restaurants and sales of discretionary goods such as jewelry, alcohol and tobacco led the growth of retail sales in March.The economy was also boosted by a jump in investment from overseas. Inbound investment into China rose almost 40% to $45 billion in the first three months of 2021, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce released Thursday. That was the highest for that period in comparable data back to 2002.Markets were choppy following the data release but ended the day little changed, with the benchmark CSI 300 Index paring an earlier loss of as much as 0.6% to finish up 0.35% for the day. The yield on benchmark 10-year sovereign debt fell slightly to 3.16%. The onshore yuan was unchanged on the day at 6.5226 per dollar.Broadening out the recovery remains a work in progress with growth in the first quarter still reliant on the property sector. Fixed-asset investment in real estate rose 7.6% on a two-year average growth basis and infrastructure spending increased roughly in-line with pre-pandemic rates. Quarterly steel production of 271 million tons suggests that annual output is on course to top 1 billion tons for the second year running.What Bloomberg Economics Says...The undershoot in GDP growth relative to expectations and lopsided nature of the recovery do not warrant any economy-wide shift in monetary policy, in our view.Looking forward, production is poised to start peaking, while demand should pick up further. This should add more balance in what looks to be a steady recovery ahead.Chang Shu, chief Asia economistFor full report, click hereAlthough Beijing has promised no sharp turns in monetary and fiscal support this year, some prominent economists have warned that premature tightening could still put the recovery at risk. The central bank has asked banks to curtail loan growth in coming months as it seeks to control credit to curb asset bubbles. Alongside the investment data, data showing home prices grew at the fastest pace in seven months in March will likely prompt more action by Chinese policy makers to rein in the sector.Considering the robust recovery, we certainly do not expect Beijing to step up easing measures, but it is also unlikely to make a sharp shift in its policy stance, Nomura economists led by Lu Ting wrote in a note. Authorities have learned lessons from a forceful deleveraging campaign in 2017-18, which led to bond defaults, a stock market selloff and weaker growth, they said.The statistics bureau said Friday inflation is expected to remain in a moderate range this year, and while rising commodity costs could boost domestic prices, theres no basis for prices in upstream sectors to rise significantly.The economy is far from overheating, said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd. The consumer sector doesnt have a solid basis for overheating, and I dont think the central bank will take a faster turn for monetary policy.Bloomberg Economics forecasts global GDP growth of 6.9% in 2021, rapid enough to bring output substantially back onto its pre-Covid path. Data released Thursday showed the U.S. economys comeback is firing on all cylinders, with retail sales exceeding pre-pandemic levels in all categories except restaurants.

However,","0 Bitcoin is suddenly all over mainstream media, whetting the appetite of risk-taking investors interested in entering positions in cryptocurrencies However, what they dont understand is all the benefits that this emerging asset class and the underlying blockchain technology have to offer. Negative perceptions about cryptocurrencys use for crime continue to get in the way of widespread acceptance. And even if that barrier is broken, learning about the technology and even using it can be challenging or confusing at first. However, Euler.Tools, the worlds first real-time block explorer platform that intends to disrupt the crypto trading industry using interconnected data, could finally make learning crypto and blockchain easy. Heres how Euler.Tools is helping traders see and understand blockchain technology and market events all from one single platform. The Early Mathematical Origins Behind Euler.Tools The story of how Euler.Tools first began was a struggle. Founder Jorge de los Santos got into crypto trading after finding success in other markets, only to get totally liquidated. His fascination with where the money went from there fueled his passion for learning more about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The more he searched for concrete sources of information, Santos realized that the industry still faced many challenges. As Santos first began his ambitious project, developers were unfamiliar with blockchain, and there were still many misconceptions about the technology itself. Santos was inspired by mathematician Leonhard Euler, who created graph theory and solved The Seven Bridges of Knigsberg problem. Euler.Tools applies an old methodology to modern-day problems to find the most efficient bridges into blockchain understanding and adoption. The Right Tools To Build The Future Of Blockchain Solutions Crypto traders are armed to the teeth with various tools and data sources, including TradingView, DexTools, BitQuery, and much more. But to access all this information, either the trader needs to invest in dozens of monitors or needsa to visit website after website after website to get all the info they need. Education is even more challenging with regard to bringing new users into the space. In addition, what exists today is difficult to understand clearly. Euler.Tools is revolutionizing blockchain data and education with an all-in-one solution, bringing together crucial data feeds to make widespread crypto adoption a reality. Convenience is a significant barrier in cryptocurrencies today. By including everything from tax prep to data visualization tools for fundamental and technical analysis, the technology will finally be accessible enough to grow. How Euler.Tools Revolutionizes Traditional Oracle Solutions Euler.Tools is an oracle that checks every single contract, operation, blockchain, and more, aggregating all information into its innovative data bridge blockchain architecture. The protocol even taps into other Oracle feeds, making it what is dubbed as a MetaOracle. The process itself is fully automated, avoiding delays due to manual intervention and preventing bayesian distortion. The information is also highly detailed. For example, most feeds only consider pricing, while Euler.Tools looks at liquidity, profitability, gas costs, and other vital data critical to decision making. The fully transparent, real-time blockchain explorer can filter data by contract, exchange, base currency, trading pair, and more. You as the user can check volumes, addresses, wallets, minting rates, token burn rates, and just about anything that you could possibly imagine. Wallets can be directly connected to the platform for further data enrichment, putting you in tune even more with your trading portfolio than ever before. From there, you can create set up alerts, monitor token progress, and get notified when new tokens are created, and so much more. Learn More About Bridging The Gap To Adoption With Euler.Tools Euler.Tools also integrates the deflationary EULER token for holders to participate in liquidity mining and receive exclusive incentives and benefits. A buyback mechanism supports long-term growth in the value of the token by reducing the overall circulating supply. Holding EULER tokens gives users access to basic platform functionality. Simultaneously, various subscription tiers are available for those interested in taking advantage of key platform features, such as the DEX Block Explorer, Big Data Query, Portfolio Protection, and the Aggregated Data Trading Interface. Using all of the tools Euler has to offer, novices can become pros in no time at all, while experts now have a one-stop-shop source for all their data needs.

April 14, 2021 | Written by: Categorized: Banking and financial markets| Blockchain explained| Blockchain in financial services Share this post: How can businessesabsorb disruptive impact and begin to integrate these new business models in existing and new streams of business opportunity? NFTs have taken the world by storm. Rejuvenating the blockchainmovement started by Bitcoin, followed by smart contract platform Ethereum, NFTs seem to be a natural progression in the explosion of asset tokenization, of all kinds of things we value. NFT stands for non-fungible token and to understand NFT we need to understand the concept of fungibility! What is an NFT? An asset is considered fungible when it is considered mutually interchangeable with another identical item. For instance, money which can be changed for other forms and modality or other purposes. In the crypto-sphere, most native assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum serve the same function, besides its core purpose or providing utility they are also fungible tokens. By this definition non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, invert the definition of fungibility and provide a unique perspective of other things that are also as valuable to us as money and can be measured in fungible units. See how blockchain adds value to trade and finance NFTs solve the issue of uniqueness and a one-of-a-kind asset type. Examples include not only the popular collectable such as digital art, music, and other digital collectibles  which we value and treasure  but can also include other practical objects such as digital IDs, healthcare records, credit history and others, which are unique, valuable to us, and serve a purpose in digital networks powered by blockchain So, while blockchain is the underlying technology that provides a transaction system by enforcing a digital ledger and enforces rules of engagement via smart contracts it also extended tenets such as immutability, transaction record and transparency to facilitate verification and asset movement with an embedded trust system. What can NFTs be used for? NFTs are also a type of token and asset class online  other tokenized assets can include stable coin, security tokens, tokenized securities and others. NFTs are unique in that they can be tradable (art and collectibles) or hypothecated (healthcare records or digital history) and this is where things get interesting. As NFTs are also things of value and make their way into marketplaces they need a fungible token like a utility coin or stable coin for derivation of value in measurable terms. These marketplaces will usually need integration with either banking rails or existing crypto-provided rails such as digital exchanges or a DeFi ecosystem to facilitate trade and transfer. I address the complex issue of a fleeting and rapid rise of NFTs, after a similar meteoric phased rise of decentralized finance(DeFi), creating amazing innovations with the immense promise of democratization, new business models, and global marketplaces with global access  all fueled by the basic premise of decentralization and fundamental constructs of tokenization and wallets. NFTs may be characterized as unique one-of-a-kind cryptographic tokens with some intrinsic value to the holder (ID, health record) or a market (art, collectible). Where are NFTs going next? NFTs that have an intrinsic value and are essentially tokens that are simple proof-validations of the existence, authenticity, and ownership of digital assets. Fungible tokens are valued on various bases, such as the sum total of economic activity in the network (cryptocurrency), utility (smart contracts and transaction network processing), assigned values (as in stable coins and security tokens), and so on. NFTs represent both transferable entities and non-transferable tokens that we value. We begin to realize the promise of blockchain that envisioned digitization, tokenization and democratization of finance by enabling networks that are capable of moving value with reduced friction and intermediation. The question to ponder now is: how do businesses, individuals and enterprises understand the transformative and disruptive impact and begin to integrate these new business models into existing and new streams of business opportunity?

Another event headliner, MicroStrategy MSTR CEO Michael Saylor, pointed out that the result is mic-drop-worthy: We went from zero adoption in the world to 26% enthusiasm in less than 12 months, he says. But despite the galloping interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from both institutional and retail investors, Schulman said PayPal, is one large company that is unlikely to put bitcoin on its balance sheet this year, citing volatility concerns from investors. On the flipside, Saylor noted on a separate panel that everybody talks about the volatility of bitcoin, but volatility measures the rate at which it's going up in price. It's the same as buying the volatility of Tom Brady. He's got the highest volatility in the Football League, LeBron James has high volatility in the basketball league. The winner of every single sport and the winning team of everything on Earth is always the most volatile by definition because it's the one that's winning most often, added Saylor. Since August 11, 2020, when MicroStrategy revealed its first bitcoin purchase worth $250 million, the software company has bought $2.2 billion in bitcoin, more than any other publicly traded company in the world. Its stock has soared 534.3%over the past 12 months, while bitcoin has gained 817.5% and the S&P 500 has added 49.6% over the same period. Most of the event discussions centered around bitcoin and the ever-rising wave of institutional bitcoin mania, with comments from Fidelity, Northern Trust NTRS , and CME Group CME . Yet alternative cryptocurrencies and blockchains were also mentioned. Visa's head of crypto Cuy Sheffield said the credit card giant ultimately wants to support new types of cryptocurrencies and protocols and find ways to integrate them into Visas core network. Last month, the company started accepting settlement payments from its global cryptocurrency wallet partner Crypto.com in stablecoin USDC on the ethereum blockchain. Beyond cryptocurrencies, executives from Walmart Global Tech, luxury powerhouse LVMH, South Africa-based pulp producer Sappi and partner of Russias leading mining and smelting producer Nornickel, Atomyze, discussed applications of distributed ledger technology in supply chain tracking and fraud prevention. The two-hour event concluded with a panel discussion with DTCC and Vanguards blockchain bosses showing how the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the process of merging the two worlds of enterprise blockchain, which traditionally doesnt use cryptocurrency, with the growing digital asset space. John Evans, head of blockchain strategy at Vanguard, said: With the net effect of everything that occurred in markets between the beginning of the lockdown and maybe the fourth quarter, I think that all of the mindset that needed to shift definitely at all levels of these large financial services organizations finally coalesced.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-13 15:00:00,Where Will Bitcoin and Blockchain Fit in the Banking System in 25 Years? -- The Motley Fool,One of these may have a brighter future than the other.,") Jun 27, 2018 at 10:45AM Will bitcoin truly become the currency of the world? Will blockchain technology be used in our everyday lives? host Michael Douglass and Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel think the answer is ""yes,"" but only to one of these two questions. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on June 25, 2018. Michael Douglass: Let's start with blockchain. I believe that blockchain will be in widespread use for its dispersed ledger capabilities. I will further add, I do not think that Fannie and Freddie will be using blockchain for mortgages because I think they're going to lag the rest of the market. But, I'm betting that, throughout the private sector, blockchain will be used for contracts, and maybe even some non-agency conforming loans might be using blockchain for validation. Matt Frankel: There are a ton of applications for blockchain technology. We're only starting to see this pick up a little bit. One important distinction I want to make -- and we're going to get into this in a little more detail in a minute -- blockchain does not mean Bitcoin. Blockchain does not mean any other cryptocurrency. This is a form of technology. It's just like saying, ""The internet does not mean Microsoft."" It's one thing that came out of internet technology. Blockchain technology, I definitely agree with Michael on this one, is going to grow by leaps and bounds. There are so many applications, not only in finance but in fields like healthcare, for example. There are a ton of applications for blockchain in terms of record-keeping and things like that. I definitely agree with you on that one. Douglass: Here's the one that, I don't think it's going to be too controversial between you and me, Matt, but it might be for some of our listeners -- I do not believe that any of the current major cryptocurrencies will be in widespread use for conducting business transactions. There, I said it! They are too resource-intensive, they're just too slow, and they can't handle the volume. Now, that's not to say that they won't be used as validation. Again, I think blockchain will be. But, I don't think we're going to be regularly paying the pizza delivery guy with Bitcoin. Now, I do believe that new cryptocurrencies will emerge and may, in fact -- and probably will -- better solve the speed and cost difficulties that would plague today's cryptos at scale. But, I do not believe that any of our current -- you might think of them as first or second-generation -- cryptos will be in widespread, common use across society. Frankel: Just to add a little more color to that, when Michael says the major cryptocurrencies, I believe you're referring to, what, the biggest dozen or two dozen that exist right now? Douglass: Yeah, exactly. Frankel: OK. There are 1,900 cryptocurrencies in counting right now. Douglass: [laughs] Right! Frankel: And there are more coming online every day. It's possible that the ones that will eventually have a big impact have already been invented. There's already third-generation cryptocurrencies being invented. But it's way too early to tell. Who knows which one of the 1,900 could eventually become what everyone thinks Bitcoin is going to become? There's no way of knowing right now. Will cryptocurrency still be a thing in the future? Absolutely. It could definitely one day -- probably not in the next 25 years -- completely replace our currency system as we know it. Will it be Bitcoin itself that does it? Probably not. And that's kind of the point there. It is interesting to note, though, that a lot of those 1,900 cryptocurrencies utilize Bitcoin and Ethereum and the other blockchains in their technology. That's an interesting dynamic. But, will Bitcoin itself be as big as everyone thinks it's going to be in 25 years? I'm predicting no.

The company said it mined 75% more Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) tokens than it did last year, and that has the market excit","tokens than it did last year, and that has the market excited. As of 11 a.m. EDT today, Riot Blockchain stock was up 8%. So what According to today's press release, Riot Blockchain mined 491 Bitcoins in the first quarter, with 187 of those coming in March alone. This was a notable increase from last year. First-quarter Bitcoin production was up 75% from the same period in 2020, and production in March was up 80% year over year. Image source: Getty Images. This is particularly noteworthy because it was twice as easy to mine Bitcoin last year, so to speak. Every few years, the Bitcoin network has what's called a ""halving event."" When Bitcoin reaches a halving date, the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half. Miners do the same amount of work, but don't get the same payout. Since May 2020, miners have been getting just 6.25 Bitcoin tokens per block mined. Therefore, Riot Blockchain has increased its computing power enough to not only compensate for the halving event but also take Bitcoin mining share. This can be measured with something called a ""hash rate."" The company ended 2019 with a hash rate of around 100 peta-hashes per second (PH/s) whereas the total hash rate of Bitcoin was around 100 thousand PH/s, according to Blockchain.com. Now, Riot Blockchain's hash rate is expected to reach 1,600 PH/s by the end of this month while the total hash rate of the network is around 172,000 PH/s. From these numbers, it's clear to see Riot Blockchain's growth is outpacing the growth of the network. Mining share is important. The amount of Bitcoin tokens that can be mined is fixed. So Bitcoin miners are paid relative to the amount of hash rate they provide the network. With Riot Blockchain increasing its share, its payouts are also increasing, which is why investors are excited today. Image source: Getty Images. Now what Riot Blockchain isn't settling for its hash rate of 1,600 PH/s, and for good reason. With the price of Bitcoin now over $60,000, many miners are actively buying new mining machines in hopes of getting more of this valuable cryptocurrency Riot intends to have a hash rate of 7,700 PH/s by the end of 2022. This will be a gradual process, but investors can expect timely updates. Also in today's announcement, Riot Blockchain said it intends to update shareholders on its mining progress monthly. 10 stocks we like better than Riot Blockchain, Inc When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What is Blockchain? Blockchain is always associated with Bitcoin, since it is the technology that allows mining and transactions using virtual currency. In other words, Blockchain is what guarantees that a given user owns a certain amount in Bitcoin, as well as what validates the transfer or payment using the virtual currency. But of course, Blockchain goes far beyond Bitcoin. After all, the technology allows data validation in a very efficient and decentralized way, which meant that the technology could be considered as a verification method in several segments. How does Blockchain work? The data in the Blockchain obeys a standard so that they can be verified and validated at any time, causing a chain of information to exist that necessarily needs to be associated with each one of them, in order. This order makes it impossible to cross the data chain, since, for a data to be validated, part of the information is in the previous data and part in the next data. This cascading organization allows greater reliability throughout the system, as it is not possible to insert data randomly into the Blockchain. Therefore, a transaction can only be carried out once, inhibiting duplication and even fraud. Its safe? Lets imagine that we arrived at a location that offers service passwords, so that, these passwords bring in addition to a number that orders the arrival of users, date and time information for removing the password. That is, in a single data it is possible to know when the user arrived, who arrived before and who should be next. Blockchain works in a similar way, so that data can be validated basically in the same way as a password, since each one of them presents information about its origin and cannot be duplicated. As we have seen, it is practically impossible to defraud a movement through Blockchain, which has led financial institutions to consider the validation modality for their movements. In addition, the method allows data verification in a very efficient way, which can be used to validate certificates and even virtual documents and contracts. The technology is not yet used on a large scale outside the cryptocurrency universe, but the tendency is for there to be an expansion of the validation modality, since it is an extremely safe way to guarantee the reliability of information transmitted over the internet, including being an alternative for security of connected devices.

MIAMI (PRWEB) April 11, 2021 Blockchain strategies are to be discussed on an upcoming episode of Viewpoint with Dennis Quaid. The informational television segment will cover the innovative uses for the technology alongside the leading blockchain experts making strides in the industry. Content providers will supply information for the episode, which is to be produced by the creative team behind the Viewpoint program. Blockchain made its debut in 2008 as part of a proposal for Bitcoin, a virtual currency system. It is an open, shared ledger that can efficiently record transactions between two parties in a verifiable and permanent way. Blockchains are commonly used for recording transactions made with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Contracts and transactions, and the records, are part of the core structure of today's economic, political, and legal systems. With blockchain, contracts can be embedded with code and stored in transparent shared databases protected from deletion, revision, and tampering. Every process from signatures, to agreements and payments, could have a digital record and signature that could be validated, stored, shared, and identified. Blockchain can create transparency and protection where it currently is lacking. Viewpoint is proud to share information about the new advances in the digital world that are making futures brighter and will provide additional details about blockchain technology's uses in the latest episode. Dennis Quaid will introduce the segment on Viewpoint. The short-form Viewpoint program is made for audiences with the intent to educate. The show has received multiple Tellys and is created by a tenured crew of creative developers and producers.

Prices and daily changes as of Jan. 26, 2018 at 12:30 p.m. EST; prices are rounded to the nearest cent where appropriate. Ripple (XRP-USD) has been a major laggard recently. The cryptocurrency, which gained notoriety for its partnerships with companies like American Express and MoneyGram International, traded for as much as $1.70 last Friday, and now trades for 28% less. The likely reason for the drop is the news that Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck abruptly halted withdrawals earlier today. Rumors indicate that the exchange was hacked and could have lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies -- particularly NEM, down 6.9% today, and Ripple (XRP-USD). $240 million flows into blockchain ETFs in one week A couple of blockchain-based ETFs launched last week, and to say that investors seem interested is an understatement. Since their launch, about $240 million has flowed into the two new funds. So what is a blockchain ETF? Instead of investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, blockchain ETFs invest in the stocks of companies that have substantial investments in, or involvement with, blockchain technology. Here are a few examples of the holdings of these young ETFs, and why each one is included: Overstock.com: Overstock was one of the first online retailers to accept bitcoin several years ago, and it's actively involved in the blockchain industry. The company has an entire division focused on blockchain projects, and it recently announced a partnership with Siebert Financial to offer low-cost brokerage services, which may include cryptocurrency trading. IBM: IBM has several blockchain projects, including a partnership with Stellar to develop a real-time payments system. Square: Payment-processing company Square recently began experimenting with bitcoin purchases in its Square Cash app. Notice that stocks like the Bitcoin Investment Trust and Riot Blockchain are not included. The new ETFs are not aiming to invest in cryptocurrencies themselves or ; nor are they speculating on unproven companiesthat have the word ""blockchain"" in their names. Rather, these ETFs are intended as investments focusing on established companies that could benefit from advances in blockchain technology.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-11 06:11:00,Bitcoin Investing: These 2 Companies Are Investing Millions in Blockchain,"While trashing cybercurrencies, big business is investing huge sums into the underlying technology.",". A report from CB Insightsshows just how active corporations are in the space. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet has invested millions in the technology, but very little in cryptocurrencies CB Insights notes that corporations have made more than 140 equity investments in blockchain since 2012 with a total investment of $1.2 billion. As of the time of the report, 42 corporate deals had taken been inked. Except for Japanese company SBI Holdings, CB Insights lists Alphabet as the largest corporate blockchain investor with six investments through its Google Ventures arm. Alphabet is more concerned with blockchain than currencies. The company's most notable blockchain investment, Ripple, uses the technology to settle international bank transactions. The company claims it can do so with a one-third reduction in operating costs and allow lenders to move money in seconds. However, since its biggest clients are banks, it's unlikely that cryptocurrencies are the trading currency, but rather blockchain is the technology to help banks transact in fiat currencies. Other investments are in a similar vein to Ripple: Ledger X, the first regulated institutional trading platform, Veem, the online payment provider that uses blockchain to settle international transactions, and Storj, a blockchain-based cloud storage service. Overstock is a rare ""all-of-the-above"" investment Outside of investing in cryptocurrencies, perhaps the best way to invest in the cyber currency craze is Overstock. CEO Patrick Byrne is the most outspoken supporter of bitcoin among major CEOs, noting ""bitcoin is more powerful than physical money."" Additionally, the company was among the first retailers that transacted in bitcoin More recently, Overstock is creating more of a buzz with its blockchain forays than its online retail operations. Under its Medici Ventures unit, the company has a portfolio of 12 different companies. (This differs from CB Insights count of six investments in total, but the difference appears to be that some of Medici's companies were internally developed.) The most recognized company in Medici Ventures' portfolio is the blockchain-based cybercurrency trading platform, tZERO. This month, Overstock went even further in its cybercurrency plans by launching a $250 million ICO for tokens for the tZERO that would function as preferred equity in the trading site. A small piece of the pie It's a folly to invest in the companies above to take advantage of the cryptocurrency craze. For Alphabet, 99% of its revenue comes from its Google unit, which is search and ad-related revenue. The other 1%, what Google affectionately calls Other Bets, houses many different businesses in addition to Google Ventures. Additionally, under new CFO Ruth Porat the company has been slowing spending in its Other Bets segment to improve its bottom line. Even though Byrne wants to sell Overstock's retail business to become a true blockchain-focused company, this has not occurred and it will likely be difficult to secure approval from a shareholder majority that invested in an online retailer. In the end, if you've carefully weighed the risks of this new asset class and still want exposure, there are better ways to do so than investing in these two companies.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-11 00:00:00,The Right (and Wrong) Way to Invest in Blockchains,Bitcoin investors have ridden a volatility roller coaster for the past two years. Here's a much better long-term strategy for investing in blockchains and cryptocurrencies.,"Aug 8, 2018 at 7:11AM Author Bio I am a believer in the power of disruptive innovation, and that individual investors can significantly outperform the market over long periods of time. I am the lead advisor of our Motley Fool Explorer service, where we look for future-focused companies well-poised to capitalize on developing long-term trends. Follow @@TMFInnovator What a ride it's been for blockchain investors. We've almost become numb to get-rich-quick blockchain schemes, as scores have surfaced during the past two years. It seems like everyone and their dog has devised an idea on how to make money off of blockchains Let's take a quick walk down bitcoin memory lane. The genesis of the fast-money ideas began as soon as cryptocurrencies were offered directly to the public. There was no need to be an accredited investor or to work with financial middlemen. Exchanges such as Coinbase and Circle gave individuals with no previous investing experience a way to purchase bitcoin before most people even knew what it was. Speculation ran rampant. ""Bitcoin"" became a headline that everyone wanted to read, and its price soared from $1,000 to $20,000 in 2017. Nearly 1,000 other cryptocurrencies became available to the public through Initial Coin Offerings. The rampant speculation attracted institutions like blood attracts sharks. Investment products such as Grayscale's Bitcoin Investment Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) could be bought or sold through more traditional stock brokers like Fidelity. This gave investors a way to speculate on bitcoin's price without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Things then just started getting weird. Long Island Iced Tea formally changed its nameto Long Blockchain (NASDAQ: LBCC) and its shares immediately tripled in value. Bitconnect came up with a progressive referral program to boost the value of its tokens. No one cared that actions like these weren't actually creating any value. Suddenly, everyone started rethinking their blind optimism. Long Blockchain's shares fell 95% in six months, and Bitconnect closed its doors after being exposedas a Ponzi scheme. If ""euphoria"" described the public's attitude toward blockchains in 2017, then ""trepidation"" seems to be the word for 2018. This volatility roller coaster has investors hesitant, but still eagerly waiting to see what happens next. So is there any hope for bitcoin's future? Image source: Getty Images. Peering into the blockchain crystal ball To answer that question, we should recognize that the activities described above refer to the general public's interaction with bitcoin. Things happened quickly, there was massive speculation, and most people had no idea how or where bitcoin could actually be used. But the enterprise is a completely different animal. Moving much more deliberately, large corporations actually have an interest in blockchains as a way to improve their operations. And improving operations could translate to increasing profits for shareholders. I recently spoke with CB Insights' intelligence analyst Arieh Levi at the Future of Fintech event Levi said that enterprises take a different view of blockchains than the general public: It's important to separate and understand the difference between two types of blockchain companies. The first is the crop of companies that sprouted up in 2015 and 2016 that are looking to use blockchain technology in the enterprise as corporate infrastructure to help with back-office processes. And those have seen slow growth -- a lot of local funding in those years, but certainly the growth there has slowed. Then, of course, there's the ICO mania and ICO craze. These are companies trying to build a new, decentralized web. And to a large degree, that thesis has seen lots of money -- they raised $18 billion [cumulative] during the past year, which is more than most other sectors combined, which is insane. At the same time, that sector, that area of blockchain research is softening and moving sideways with the price action. I think we can expect some more of that in the future as some of the worse projects there get flushed out. There could be a lot of promise in those slow-growth",https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/08/the-right-and-wrong-way-to-invest-in-blockchains.aspx

Just like the stock market, the cryptocurrency market is frequently subjected to extreme price fluctuations  both upwards and downwards. Tesla recently purchasing $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin is just one example of how the crypto market can change. For instance, at the end of 2013 to the beginning of 2014, during the middle of 2017 to the middle of 2018, and now again as weve seen in the past few months, there have been many highs and lows of cryptocurrencies. If we analyze the movement of cryptocurrencies across a 52-week period, its clear that the biggest market capitalization is what weve seen in the past few weeks: Bitcoin (No.1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization) has a 52-week low of US$4106 and a 52-week high of US$58,330 (which are a factor of 14.2 apart) Ethereum (No.2 by market capitalization) has a 52-week low of US$95 and a 52-week high of US$2036 (factor of 21.4 apart) Cardano (No.3 by market capitalization) has a 52-week low of US$0.01913 and a 52-week high of US$1.48 (factor of 77.4 apart) (Data source: https://coinmarketcap.com accessed on March 2, 2021.) This level of fluctuation within a one-year period is seldom seen in the stock market, and its generally not something thats happening once-off to one specific cryptocurrency; its happening often, and to several cryptocurrencies. Understanding the blockchain ecosystem Over the past few years, blockchain technology has swiftly advanced as more companies, researchers and developers begin to adopt and understand it. In the first generation of blockchain platforms, there were many limitations to scalability, the high consumption of energy, limited support of smart contracts, and so on. Now, hundreds of projects and platforms are trying to improve different aspects of blockchain technology, involving hundreds of highly qualified researchers and thousands of skillful engineers. Leading global institutions believe blockchain solutions can have a huge economic impact. However, the realization of this potential will depend on factors such as the technological advances, the acceptance of blockchain solutions by the industry and the general population, the legislation passed to regulate the blockchain space, and the development of new business models based on the technology. Linking back to the crypto market Theres a possibility the recent cryptocurrency price hikes are partially or totally justified by changes in the market participants perception of the factors affecting the future prospects of blockchain platforms. However, in the long run, the value of the cryptocurrencies will depend on the financial added value generated by the blockchain ecosystem. If we look back to the 1990s and the dot-com boom, there was a huge growth in internet use, and it was recognized it would change the world. Hundreds of net-related companies appeared and began developing technologies, services, and applications. A market bubble eventuated due to excessive speculation, and in the crash, numerous companies were forced to shut down. But the internet, of course, turned out to indeed be revolutionary, and some of the companies formed at that time are today among the worlds biggest. If blockchain technologys potential is realized, perhaps many of the current blockchain platforms and projects wont make the cut, drastically reducing in value or vanishing altogether. But, theres a reasonable chance that some of them will be big winners.",https://scitechdaily.com/whats-the-buzz-about-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-technology/

Exchange lightly edited. This week we spoke to Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, a crypto lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C. What's the biggest item on the agenda in Washington this year? Anti-money laundering policy is probably the biggest one we're worried about. Done incorrectly, that could have major effects on the growth of the industry. Securities laws are another issue that always seem to flare up with different enforcement actions. But, you know, there's also some sort of lesser tax policy issues. There is policy related to stablecoins. There are privacy issues. And those are very important in and of themselves, but relative to the anti-money laundering stuff and securities stuff, they have to take a little bit of a backseat, because they're a little bit less of an existential threat. Are U.S. admins learning more about crypto as we go? Yes, and I think that tracks with overall understanding by the general public, and also the growth and expansion of new types of crypto networks and the growth in Americans that hold crypto assets, right? From the industry's perspective, the whole point is to replace centralized organizations with decentralized software protocols ... Just that basic understanding of what crypto actually does, that it's more than just this kind of digital-asset that you sell, and trade, but it's actually these networks that perform really complex services  I think that is still lost on those people. Kristin Smith Has Congress warmed to digital-assets yet? It's still a challenge, particularly for Congress, because they're spread so thin. There's definitely a small set of energized members that are into crypto. They tend to be more on the Republican side than the Democratic side. But we have a few Democrats that are starting to get interested. Do you expect regulation efforts to pick up as the market expands? We're going to have a little bit of time. I don't think they're going to come running out of the gate. Back in 2017, when all of the initial coin offerings (ICOs) were going on, that was a problem, right, because the consumers were being harmed. So, if crypto can stay on good behavior, so to speak, and build things in a responsible way, I think well have time.

Now the Chinese unit, which remains under Wus control, has filed lawsuits against three senior executives the board designated to replace him, according to people familiar with the matter. The previously unreported suits could take years to resolve, suggesting Wu may remain entrenched.Wu fired the three men -- including co-CEO Phil Tang -- but they were subsequently reinstated by the board. In the new lawsuits, Arm China is suing the trio, demanding they return company property, according to the people.Arm China declined to comment on any ongoing legal cases or possible settlement talks. It did say the three executives had caused material damages to the company and they had been terminated for legitimate reasons.Tang didnt return requests for comment. Arm Ltd. declined to elaborate, saying it wont comment on pending legal matters.The complex tussle has thrown into question the future of Arm, whose semiconductor technology is the worlds most widely used for smartphones and is increasingly deployed in computers. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son agreed to sell the British chip designer to Nvidia for $40 billion last year, but the path for completing that transaction is growing increasingly difficult.The China dispute also raises questions about Beijings willingness to protect foreign investment in the worlds second-largest economy. Arm Ltd. sold a majority stake in the China unit to a consortium of investors, including Beijing-backed institutions. That has complicated the British firms efforts to manage Arm China and Wu, who has support from local authorities in Shenzhen.Both sides appear to be at a stalemate. Wu, a Chinese-born U.S. citizen, pulled back from signing settlement agreements worth tens of millions of dollars if he would leave the company, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about legal matters. At the same time, two minority shareholders in Arm China linked to Wu have filed lawsuits to overturn his June 4 dismissal, they said.SoftBank opened negotiations with him last year and had hoped to reach some sort of resolution, they said. Instead the court battles are deepening and the Japanese company has soured over the increasingly complicated dispute, the people said. SoftBank is now resigned to letting the legal proceedings take their course and there are no current negotiations with Wu, according to one of the people.We are going through a leadership change in China; its taking time to resolve, said Arm Ltd.s Chief Executive Officer Simon Segars in an interview with Bloomberg Television recently. Its hard. But we are confident thats going to get resolved.SoftBank and Nvidia declined to comment on the dispute in China.Arm China said in a statement that Wus position is compliant with legal registration and confirmed by China law and regulations.Read more: Arm Takes Aim at Intel Chips in Biggest Tech Overhaul in DecadeThe standoff accords a relatively unknown executive outsized influence over one of the industrys most important pieces of technology, in the worlds biggest internet and semiconductor market. Chinese companies need unfettered access to Arms products to push forward with the countrys attempts to make itself more independent in chip technology, an area where its largely reliant on imports. Beyond resolving the stalemate, Nvidia and SoftBank also need Beijings signoff to seal their deal, and its unclear whether Wus presence would complicate that.Wus hold on Arm China is partially due to local laws which make it difficult to change control of a company unless youre physically in control of the company stamp and registration documents. Hes refused to give them up and has used company funds to pay for legal fees incurred in his attempt to fight off his dismissal, the people said.Arm China said payment of legal fees is made in compliance with company policies as well as China laws and regulations.His ultimate goals appear to be a large cash payoff and immunity from subsequent legal action, according to people whove spoken with him. Inside Arm China, which is responsible for selling licenses to its chip designs and fundamental technology in the country, Wu has told local staff hes not going anywhere. He recently gave employees Chinese New Year cash presents in a red envelope with his surname on it.Arm China said the money came from Wu personally to show his appreciation to colleagues, a tradition at Chinese New Year in the country.Hearings in the case against the three executives are expected to take place in late May, one of the people said. Separately, two minority shareholders in Arm China have sued the Chinese entity in Shenzhen to nullify the boards decision to oust Wu. These two cases are now being merged and hearings are slated for late April, the people said.Son told investors as recently as February that he expects to close the Arm sale and I dont have any Plan B.Arm, for its part is trying to make sure that its technology remains pervasive in China despite U.S. sanctions intended to curb the supply of American technology to major companies like Huawei Technologies Co. While Arm is a U.K.-based company part of its operations are in the U.S. making its products subject to controls.The Chinese government has not stated its position on the Arm China leadership struggle, but the unit has several government-backed shareholders including sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. and the Silk Road Fund.In his interview with Bloomberg Television, Arm Ltd.

Bloomberg Russian Tycoon Komarov Eyes Precious Metals After Pipes Sale (Bloomberg) -- Russian tycoon Andrey Komarov is setting his sights on precious metals mining after selling ChelPipe PJSC, the pipe maker that made him a billionaire.Komarov is talks to purchase the Kumroch gold deposit in Russias Far East from Zoloto Kamchatki, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as its private. Hes also interested in investing in the Fedorova Tundra platinum and palladium project in the Murmansk region, the head of the company that owns the deposit said in March.While demand for steel pipes fell during the coronavirus crisis, platinum-group metals prices rallied on supply disruptions and stricter emissions rules that boost usage in autocatalysts. Even though gold has been pressured in recent months on bets for a economic recovery, prices are still historically high amid ultra-loose monetary policies around the world.A spokeswoman for Komarov said hes considering investing in the Fedorova Tundra deposit in the future and that hes interested in mining projects in general, without elaborating. Zoloto Kamchatkis press service declined to comment.Until last year, Zoloto Kamchatki was controlled by billionaire Viktor Vekselbergs Renova, which sold it to Complexprom, a company owned by former Renova managers, a spokesman for Renova said, without elaborating.Komarov, 54, bought his first stake in ChelPipe in the late 1990s, and saw his wealth soar after rebuilding the companys facilities, impressing the Kremlin. When visiting a new site in Chelyabinsk in 2010, President Vladimir Putin said the modern layout made it look more like Disneyland than a pipe workshop.In March, Komarov sold his 86.5% stake in ChelPipe to rival TMK PJSC for 84 billion rubles ($1.1 billion). The tycoons fortune now stands at about $1.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The Kumroch deposit holds 34.4 tons (1.1 million ounces) of gold reserves, a Zoloto Kamchatki representative said. It is due to start mining in 2025, with expected annual output of as much as 5 tons.Komarovs Atom Gold has already filed documents to the anti-monopoly service to approve the purchase of 75% and one share of the company that holds the Kumroch license, the people said. The rest would be held by Zoloto Kamchatki, with the partnership sharing the risks of a big project, they said.The Fedorova Tundra deposit is expected to produce as much as 250,000 tons of concentrate annually, mostly containing PGMs, but also nickel, copper and gold.

Understanding blockchain's logistics applications Last year, Walmart food safety chief Frank Yiannas demonstrated that the condition and origin of any food product across the retailer's network could be tracked in two seconds via blockchain -- a process which would have taken nearly a week with older tracking methods. That's why it's smart for JD to use blockchain tracing on food sold on its marketplace. China has been plagued with food safety issues, and the implementation of blockchain-tracked food gives customers a higher level of assurance, which complements JD's corporate mantra of ""authentic products, delivered today."" Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, corporate invoices (known as ""fapiao"" in Chinese) are tightly regulated in China, where they're issued for all financial transactions to discourage tax fraud. Keeping track of all corporate invoices can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, so digitizing all those invoices on a blockchain network where transactions can be quickly tracked could save companies like China Pacific Insurance lots of time and money. But JD's already late to the party JD's blockchain platform sounds revolutionary, but plenty of other companies have already entered the blockchain-as-a-service market. Tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon all offer blockchain-as-a-servicesolutions as extensions of their cloud businesses. In China, Baidu launched a blockchain-as-a-serviceplatform in January. Alibaba already uses blockchain to track purchases, and its fintech affiliate Ant Financial uses blockchain to let Alipay users track charitable donations. Alibaba and Ant Financial also hold the highest number of blockchain-related patents in the entire world. Tencent launched a blockchain-as-a-service platform last year, applied that technology to its fintech transactions and logistics, and even used it to help consumers track medical prescriptions. JD could struggle to grow its blockchain platform against these rivals because it lacks a major cloud infrastructure platform. It could eventually expand the service, but that could be a costly effort for a company that is already struggling with high expenses. JD's tech and content expenses surged 80% annually last quarter, and contributed heavily to its net loss It's not a game changer Blockchain-related news attracts plenty of attention these days, but few of these projects will actually move the needle for their companies. JD's investments in blockchain should improve quality control standards in its own marketplace -- which could boost customer loyalty and widen its moat against Alibaba. However, the blockchain platform probably won't become a meaningful source of revenue because there are simply too many competitors in the market, and unlike JD, those competitors can bundle their blockchain solutions with other cloud services.

nasdaq,NotProvided,2021-04-08 20:03:06,Solving the Challenges of Private Blockchain Transactions,"Transaction privacy is a problem thats existed for almost as long as Bitcoin has been around, despite many wrong assumptions in the early days that blockchain offered anonymity","Apr 9, 2021 2:25PM EDT By Huang Lin Transaction privacy is a problem thats existed for almost as long as Bitcoin has been around, despite many wrong assumptions in the early days that blockchain offered anonymity. However, the reality is that even in the Bitcoin white paper , Satoshi Nakamoto acknowledged the public nature of blockchain transactions. The knowledge of which Bitcoin addresses belong to Satoshi is generally accepted public wisdom among the blockchain community. As soon as Bitcoins lack of privacy became apparent, developers have been working with varying degrees of success to find solutions. In general, the aim is to allow users to transact with at least the same degree of relative privacy they enjoy with their fiat bank accounts while preserving trustlessness. The most widely-used privacy technology is the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, also known as zk-SNARKs or zero-knowledge proofs. They allow one party to prove a statement regarding certain information without actually revealing the information itself, using a secret key thats generated before the transaction happens. An Imperfect Solution Several projects now use zk-SNARKS, including Zcash, Monero, Grin, and Tornado Cash. However, like so many implementations in blockchain, developers have made trade-offs comparable to the famous scalability versus decentralization debate. With zk-SNARKs, the compromise is between scalability and the security of the privacy solution. Zcash, which is a privacy coin, and Tornado Cash, a private transaction protocol, both opted for an implementation that compromises on security while preserving scalability. Their zk-SNARKs require that the secret key used for the transaction is generated using a trusted setup. Essentially, this means that a party has to be trusted with the secret keys that could enable them to launch a double-spend attack. Without undermining the popularity of both projects, the solution flies in the face of blockchains strive for trustlessness and security against double-spend attacks. The other option is the zero-knowledge proof scheme without the need for a trusted setup, but in a way that makes the proof size so large as to cause blockchain bloat. Monero and Grin both opted for this side of the trade-off, meaning that their privacy solutions create a sub-optimal user experience while offering a better guarantee of security. Like the other famous blockchain debate, iterations on the same problem eventually lead to a solution. Now in 2020, projects are starting to emerge that have solved the trade-off, offering anonymous payment protocols for smart contract platforms using an innovation called zk-ConSNARKs. This provides a near-constant proof size while removing the requirement for a trustless setup and thus the security risk of a double-spend attack. Misaligned Incentives The idea of introducing mining or liquidity incentives has spurred the DeFi revolution, and privacy-preserving protocols are no exception to this rule. Projects such as Tornado Cash, and more recently, Lightening Cash have introduced token-based rewards to users of their protocols as a means of increasing adoption. However, not all incentives are created equally. Tornado Cash has been highly successful at achieving a large total value locked, around $1 billion at the time of writing. Its done this by offering rewards linked to transaction values. Therefore, the average value of a deposit is above $23,000 at the time of writing. This situation comes with two issues. Firstly, it speaks to a problem thats becoming endemic in DeFi as a whole. The high transaction fees on Ethereum are pricing everyday cryptocurrency users out of the market. DeFi, which positions itself as open finance, is closed to those who dont have thousands to spend in a single transaction. The second issue is that an incentive model like the one used by Tornado Cash, which is based on the value of transactions or the total value locked, is targeted towards those who have thousands to invest. This means that it serves to limit the value of the privacy-preserving protocol itself. Hide in Plain Sight Consider it this way. If youre in a city and you want to hide, are you more likely to get identified on a relatively quiet street with only a few other people to cloak your presence? Or would it make more sense to disappear into a crowd of tourists on the busiest square in town? A model that incentivizes based on value is attracting high-value transactions from high-net-worth individuals, who number fewer than those who have lower values to invest. Furthermore, theres bound to be more interest in who is behind high-value transactions. A privacy protocol with a high volume of transactions offers more opportunities to hide. Therefore, it makes sense to align the incentives accordingly. Provide people with rewards exclusively for the number of transactions they put through a privacy protocol, rather than the value of their funds. In doing so, you have the blockchain equivalent of a city square crowded with tourists  a privacy protocol that can attract users in sufficiently high volumes to create a critical mass, incentivized by the promise of privacy mining rewards. Furthermore, basing it on a low-fee platform such as the Binance Smart Chain makes it more attractive to the masses who are likely to be deterred by Ethereums high fees. In an industry striving to deliver open finance, privacy shouldnt be something that users are forced to compromise. By providing incentive models aligned to attracting more users and removing security gaps, privacy can be democratized for all participants benefit. Author Bio: Suterusu project.

coindesk,NotProvided,2021-04-08 13:01:11,"Ethers Record Run Came With Less Support Than Bitcoins, Blockchain Analysis Shows","Few buyers snapped up ether during its most recent run to an all-time high, blockchain data shows, indicating weaker support at that level.","Compared with bitcoins (BTC) rally to a record price above $61,000 in March, ethers latest bull run to an all-time high over $2,100 was supported by scantier demand from buyers, according to a top blockchain-data analyst. Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, said on CoinDesk TVs First Mover show that relatively little ether (ETH) was bought at prices above $1,850 and even less was bought at $2,000 or above. The reason why this is important is because the price that people are willing to buy and hold at tells us the level of demand that there is at that price level, Gradwell said. So not a huge amount of demand at that $2,000 price. As of April 5, blockchain data showed there was significant ether accumulation at prices around $1,800, Gradwell wrote this week in a newsletter. That price level is likely to provide strong support because the cost of acquisition indicates historical demand for a cryptocurrency at different price levels. The analysis assumes that the buyers are unlikely to sell their crypto asset at prices below their cost of acquisition. Only about 700,000 ETH were acquired at or above $1,850, costing around $1.4 billion on April 5, three days after ether logged a new all-time high price, Gradwell wrote. By contrast, on March 29  two weeks after bitcoins price peaked  238,000 BTC costing about $14 billion were acquired at or above $57,000. The latest all-time high [ether] price of $2,151 was some way above a large level of support, and suggests that the peak was driven by a relatively small amount of demand, Gradwell wrote. This is in contrast to bitcoin, which had greater prior demand across high price levels. The chart below, from Gradwells newsletter on April 1, also shows that 0.1 million bitcoin were acquired at prices higher than the spot price on March 29: The exercise highlights the limits of using blockchain data to analyze market movements: While the data can offer extra transparency, helping investors and traders understand where cryptocurrency is moving on the networks,the data can also be misleading, relying on humans for the interpretation as well as assumptions about investor psychology. . Gradwell said on CoinDesk TV that his analysis included some potential downward biases, which could skew ethers supporting price level on the lower end. The analysis didnt capture the prices of sales and trades made on centralized exchanges. But Gradwell argued that with the increased shift of ether trading to decentralized finance (DeFi), which is trackable on the blockchain, he is not worried about such downward bias. At the same time, Gradwells analysis also flattens the cost curve of entities that acquired ether at different prices, which may skew the supporting price level lower. Large entities, such as DeFi contracts, tend to hold lots of ETH acquired at both low and high costs, he wrote in the newsletter. For example, 7.4 million ETH with an average cost of acquisition of $1,818 is held in the wrapped ether contracts. On the upward bias side, CoinDesks Lawrence Lewitinn said on the CoinDesk TV show that Gradwells analysis is based on an assumption that people would not sell their ether at a loss. If ether holders are willing to sell their ether at a loss, it means that the $1,800 supporting level may be less strong than expected. Gradwell said a majority of investors who bought ether at its peak price in 2018 sold their ether at a loss, while more bitcoin holders at the time continued to hold their bitcoin throughout the bear market. The persistence of a small, but very bullish, cohort of ether buyers supports my concern that the highest ether prices tend to have a narrow base of support, at least compared to bitcoin, Gradwell wrote.",https://www.coindesk.com/ether-support-bitcoin-blockchain

The Pandemic Highlights Blockchain's Potential Role in Increasing Resilience of Business Communities & Ecosystems. The Market to Reach US$ 30.7 Billion. The global market for Blockchain Technology is projected to reach US$ 30.7 billion by the year 2027, trailing a post COVID-19 CAGR of 43% over the analysis period 2020 through 2027. At a time when the global economic climate is spinning out of control, the blockchain technology market is expected to face severe short-term challenges in the year 2020. This year is expected to end on a dismal note as the pandemic continues to rage through the globe flaring up in second and third waves of infections, each worse than the previous wave, continuing to cause large scale human and financial destruction in countries across the world. Pessimism remains high among chief information officers (CIOs). The continued decline in business confidence is an indication of the gradually worsening economic climate, since business confidence is a well-known leading indicator of future output. Business confidence, in other words, is a barometer of investment growth. As companies revisit their Investment spending plans, its little surprise that IT budgets are being slashed. IT budgets which in the pre-pandemic period was projected to grow by over 5.5% to 6.8% supported largely by enterprise software spending is now set for sharp downward revisions. This downward revision comes despite the fact that the pandemic has set into motion a digital transformation wave. While emerging technologies like AI, IoT, automation, big data, and blockchain will benefit in the post COVID-19 period as essential technologies to have to ensure resilience to future disruptions, they currently come under the non-essential bracket especially for companies struggling to survive and remain afloat. Virtually every technology company is facing financial challenges of disrupted supply chains, business opportunities and low consumer demand for goods and services. Inability to meet quarterly revenue targets mean reduced available funds for planned IT projects. Over 45% to 55% of CIOs expect negative impact on IT budgets in the range of -10% to -40% as compared to the less than 20% who expect spending to actually increase. Excluding automation, cloud computing and technologies for remote working which are high priority as businesses come under pressure to enable WFM and remote operation to ensure business continuity, all other IT spending are being slashed. Blockchain technology will witness decline in all application areas, industrial and non-industrial sectors. While blockchain is witnessing dwindling investments, these glitches are likely to be transitory and the technology is anticipated to spring back relatively quickly than other legacy options. The technology is estimated to witness the highest level of spending over the coming years owing to its intriguing characteristics like redundancy, decentralization and transparency. These aspects are bound to push blockchain adoption across a diverse spectrum of domains, from financial services and healthcare to supply chains. The technology is expected to experience increasing interest and spending across various applications and industry verticals for addressing concerns associated with traditional options, enabling companies to gain an edge over competitors. The technology has become an integral part of business-to-business and business-to-consumer commerce, products and legal processes. Blockchain holds significant potential for prescription management, medical data, online shopping and other areas. The technology is likely to help companies in controlling supply chains, achieving traceability of products and maintaining auditable record of goods movement. Blockchain is anticipated to present new opportunities for participants to manage supply chains, track insurance records and verify medical data. Despite certain degree of reluctance, the technology is poised to find increasing acceptance across manufacturing and professional services companies in the post-pandemic era. The technology is estimated to receive a notable investment of $14.4 billion globally by 2023. The manufacturing & resources sector is estimated to register the fastest growth of 60.5% in terms of blockchain spend, followed by the distribution & services sector, which is forecast to post a solid CAGR of around 58.7%. Despite modest level of risks across majority of industries, blockchain-related deployments are slated to increase in the professional services, healthcare, manufacturing and retail industries owing to the requirement for coordination through the value chain. Regionally, the US is anticipated to remain at forefront of blockchain spending. Following slowdown, blockchain spend in majority of regions is likely to increase notably over 2018-2023, with Central and Eastern Europe & Western Europe leading from the front with a CAGR of more than 63%. Asia-Pacific is estimated to contribute nearly 19.3% of the total spending on blockchain technology in 2020. The regional market is expected to be fueled by increasing investments in the BFSI sector. The technology is anticipated to receive a major stimulus from increasing focus of various countries in Asia-Pacific to improve existing payment techniques and maintain records associated with regulatory compliance.

Markedly, bitcoin faces significant regulatory pressure around the world. Central banks have been reluctant to approve bitcoins legitimacy, primarily due to its volatility, which has hindered cryptos potential to gain mass adoption. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission has so far declined to approve a bitcoin ETF due to volatility and lack of price transparency. Banks, among financial institutions, generally face significant regulatory scrutiny because of their role in the economy. This has been a major reason behind their reluctancy in accepting bitcoin. In fact, during 2017 rally, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a fraud, and worse than tulip bulbs, referring to the Dutch tulip bubble burst in the 1600s.

Yet, there is a big difference between the degree of centralization between Cardano and Bitcoin in their block production. Cardano relies on stake pool operators to control block production on its network. The important news here is that Cardanos 2200 stake pool operators are fully decentralized. In and of itself, this news is fairly difficult to work with. Because blockchain technology and terminology remains so nascent, this kind of news is difficult to comprehend. Fortunately, we can make a pretty good comparison with Bitcoin. 85% of Bitcoin block production is done by the networks 10 most influential pools. Unfortunately this leads to a situation in which smaller stakes often have no choice but to lend their computing power to the large pools. The large pools have a greater chance to solve an algorithm with their greater computing power. And pools which solve a given algorithm are rewarded, so smaller contributors to a Bitcoin pool have an incentive to do as those pools dictate. So there is a fairly logical argument here that Bitcoins goal of decentralization may be anything but. Cardanos 2200 stake pool operators who control 100% of block production are far less likely to rebel or collude than Bitcoins 10 pools that cover 85% of its block production. Such a situation is referred to as a 51% attack. Governance One reason Cardano has gained such an ardent base of supporters is the roadmapthat it has laid out. The roadmap lays out phases of Cardanos development and central goals for each phase. Cardanos roadmap is currently in phase 5 called Voltaire, the French philosopher. The current phase of Cardanos development focuses on decentralization of its governance. Cardano is building a voting and treasury system. Participants can purchase stake  ADA coins  and that stake and voting rights can be used for influence. The treasury system will fund the future development of the Cardano network once fully implemented. In order to fund the treasury, a percentage of all transaction fees will be pooled and appropriated as voted upon. This form of governance will theoretically improve upon what is present across multiple current systems due to its decentralized nature. Cardano expects that IOHK will no longer be in control once its voting and treasury systems are in place. At that time, control should shift entirely to the ecosystem participants themselves. Network Cardanos network becomes fully decentralized once the voting and treasury systems are fully implemented. Whats interesting is that Cardano has spelled out this process and its importance to its network. It appears much more thought out and openly expressed than many other blockchain projects. These kinds of ideas and discussions about governance are usually the domain of developers alone. However, I think this is very welcome by people who are on the fence about cryptos, defi, and blockchain technology. What Cardano is doing is important for mainstream acceptance of the space. Verdict I am a fan of Cardano. I honestly believe that more of the 10,000-foot view is whats needed in blockchain and defi. At least from the marketing and PR side. I also think Cardano is one of the few projects that is actively trying to define what its ecosystem really is. It makes sense to establish a position now.

The Daily Beast Ex-Trump Official Was Finally Punished Under the Hatch Act. Whos Next? Drew AngererFor years, flagrant violations of the Hatch Act were rivaled only by Infrastructure Week as the grimmest running joke of the Trump administration. But nearly three months after President Donald Trump left office, a former administration official has been formally disciplined for exploiting their position for political purposesand more could be on the way.Lynne Patton, a longtime Trump Organization fixture and former event planner, ran afoul of the Hatch Act on multiple occasions during her tenure as public liaison director for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but openly dismissed any chance of facing discipline for violating the law.Just retweeted this amazing tweet from both of my Twitter accountsprofessional and personal, Patton wrote in a 2019 Facebook post after sharing a meme from a conservative account. It may be a Hatch Act violation. It may not be. Either way, I honestly dont care anymore.On Tuesday, however, Patton was finally disciplined for violating the ethics law, accepting a settlement from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel that included a $1,000 fine and a four-year ban from serving in the federal government. Patton was also required to admit that she had knowingly violated the law when she recruited residents of public housing to appear in a video championing Trump at the Republican National Convention last year.Normally, such violations were shrugged off by Trump officials as bureaucratic oopsies. But with the election of President Joe Biden, the Office of Special Counsel and the Merit Systems Protection Boardthe government agency tasked with adjudicating cases of potential Hatch Act violations, which sat without a board quorum for the entirety of Trumps time in officeare beginning to chip at the vast backlog of complaints from the Trump era.Ex-Trump Official Lynne Patton Violated Hatch Act With Deceptive RNC Vids: OSCThe Office of Special Counsel would not confirm the existence of pending investigations, but said that it is slightly constrained by the timing of complaints that were filed with the Merit Systems Protection Board.In order for OSC to file a complaint with the Merit Systems Protection Board, OSC would have had to file the complaint while the subject was still a federal employee, Zachary Kurz, a spokesperson for the Office of Special Counsel, told The Daily Beast. Otherwise MSPB no longer has jurisdiction.But the enormous number of extant complaints submitted to the boardwhich now number in the thousandsmean that some Trumpworld figures are nervous that they may actually face consequences for violating the Hatch Act.Let me put it this way: people are going to wish theyd never tweeted, texted one person close to the White House.Even in an administration marked by a callous disregard for ethics laws, Lynne Patton stood out, Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), the ethics watchdog organization that initially filed the complaint against Patton. What made her behavior particularly egregious was that she not only used her position for political purposes, she misled and exploited public housing residents for political gain, showing little regard for the people she was supposed to be helping and the ethics rules she was supposed to be following.Pattons actions were far from an outlier in the Trump administration, where senior officials developed a years-long pattern of violating the Hatch Act, mostly with impunity. The Republican National Convention alone presented a tsunami of potential violations of the law, from former acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf hosting a naturalization ceremony during primetime to former Secretary of State Mike Pompeos decision to address the RNC from Jerusalem to the location of its closing night on the White House lawn.In October 2020 alone, CREW found that 16 Trump officials had violated the Hatch Act an astonishing 60 times, including first daughter/senior adviser Ivanka Trump, son-in-law/senior adviser Jared Kushner, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, trade honcho Peter Navarro, and communications director Alyssa Farahbut the administrations seniormost officials were openly contemptuous of the law, which forbids using a government position or government resources for political purposes.Nobody outside of the Beltway really caresthey expect that Donald Trump is going to promote Republican values and they would expect that Barack Obama, when he was in office, that he would do the same for Democrats, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadowsa onetime stickler for the Hatch Acttold Politico in August, calling concerns by ethics experts a lot of hoopla.Or, as former White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said shortly before the Office of Special Counsel determined that she should have been removed from government service for her repeated violations of the Hatch Act: Blah, blah, blah Let me know when the jail sentence starts.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

studybreaks,NotProvided,2021-04-07 03:01:11,"Digital Gold: Bitcoin, Blockchains and NFTs Explained",It might not be long before everyone is buying and selling digital artwork to hang in their virtual homes and using cryptocurrency at grocery store checkouts.,"Post Views: 778 Skyrocketing to the moon and beyond, theres a growing movement toward the mainstream acceptance of the cryptocurrencyknown as Bitcoin. As more financial institutions begin to invest in what many are now referring to as digital gold, the world is inching closer to a massive paradigm shift that could leave people looking back at traditional currency the same way they look at ancient bartering systems. These days, its becoming much more common to come across a friend or co-worker whos excited to talk about how awesome Bitcoin is. While numbers vary depending on the source, its estimated that 80% to 90%of Americans are familiar with some type of cryptocurrency. Thats a shockingly high level of awareness and is indicative of just how far cryptocurrency has come since its inception. Now, with 10% of Americansowning Bitcoin, its important for people to have a basic understanding of how the currency operates and the mysterious history behind its creation. What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin was created in 2009 using the plans laid out in a whitepaperwritten by someone under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The true identity of Bitcoins originator has never been revealed, leaving room for speculation among the crypto community and Bitcoin detractors. There are rumors that if Nakamoto were to ever reveal his true identity the entire Bitcoin market could destabilize and come crashing to the ground. However, theres no evidence that Nakamoto, or anyone for that matter, holds anything but a limited influence on the market. In fact, what makes Bitcoin revolutionary is that it is completely decentralized, free from the constraints that come with fiat or government-controlled currencies. More importantly, though, unlike traditional fiat, theres a finite supply of Bitcoin. Nakamoto intentionally set the limit on the number of Bitcoin that could ever exist to 21 million. You might also like: Bitcoin Games on the Gaming Market? Is It True? Although the reason behind setting the supply specifically to 21 million remains a mystery, this limitation essentially prevents Bitcoin from falling into inflation. So while governments can keep printing fiat until the trees run out, Bitcoin functions as a limited commodity similar to gold, minus the physical limitations of a heavy metal brick. What Are Blockchains? Like any other precious metal thats bought and traded on the market, Bitcoin is procured through a process known as mining. Unlike its physical counterparts, though, Bitcoin is mined electronically using powerful processors. The process may seem complex, but basically, each Bitcoin transaction is processed by a large network of computers running specialized software. During a transaction, the software records both the senders and receivers Bitcoin addresses along with the amount transferred, and it enters that information onto a blockchain Anyone put off by the introduction of another amorphous digital term can simplify things by thinking of a blockchain as a virtually counterfeit-proof database. Its essentially a group of encrypted transactions permanently linked together. Every Bitcoin transaction is added to a block, and when that block is full, its chained to another block  hence the blockchain name. During this procedure, every single computer that processes Bitcoin verifies each blockchains accuracy, ensuring that it is nearly impossible to counterfeit. Simple enough, right? Well, the important thing to remember is that blockchain is the technology that makes Bitcoin work in a safe and secure manner. However, this technology isnt limited to securing cryptocurrency. While Bitcoinhas been around since 2009, recently, there has been a whole new crypto investment phenomenon that is even more difficult to understand than digital money. What Are Nonfungible Tokens (NFTs)? Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, are taking the internet by storm. NFTs are encrypted digital tokens that use the same blockchain storage method as Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, each NFT is distinct and cannot be exchanged equally for other NFTs. To put it simply, a $100 bill can be traded for another $100 bill because theres no difference in value between the two; thats what makes them fungible. A nonfungible asset, however, cannot be exchanged the same way. You might also like: Many Eco-Friendly Companies Are Just Pretending To Be Good for the Earth Theres a lot of utility behind NFTs, as they can be used to represent items both physically and digitally. Oddly enough, many of the most valuable NFTs have been digital images of physical artwork or trading cards. To add to the apparent absurdity of NFTs as a concept, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey recently sold an NFT of a link to the first-ever tweet for a whopping $2.9 million . Individuals unfamiliar with NFTs will read that and be completely dumbfounded by the idea of anyone paying such a price for something that could easily be saved as a screenshot. Its true that the value of NFTs is subjective; however, their real value comes from the same technology that makes Bitcoinwork so well. The encrypted address behind each NFT is added to a blockchain, making it a permanent and transparent asset that can be verified by anyone. So while anybody can save a screenshot of the first-ever tweet, only one copy of the NFT sold by Dorsey exists. Its this combination of digital representation and blockchain security that makes NFTs distinct assets. You might also like:",https://studybreaks.com/thoughts/nfts-bitcoin-blockchains/

According to blockchain data pulled from this journalists Bitcoin node, the result of the coin toss has determined that Taproots activation timeline will be measured using median time passed (MTP) instead of block height. For the actual toss, the last digit of the block 678079s hash were used to decide the outcome where a value of 0 represented MTP and a value of 1 represented height. Screenshot of coin flip result (Colin Harper) Taproot  an upgrade that will enrich Bitcoins smart contracts is all set to go using the Speedy Trialactivation method outlined a month ago. Todays coin toss settled a dispute, though, over how the Bitcoin blockchain will measure the time that has passed between when the upgrade is released and when it will time-out. Block height vs. MTP There were two options up for debate: one using block height, which chooses a timeout that triggers once a specific block is mined and the other using MTP, which chooses the timeout based on real-world time derived from block data. Subscribe to Subscribe By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditionsand privacy policy The coin toss occurred on block 678079 and the result landed on MTP Following the result, Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow removed his pull request for a block height-based scheme. MTP means that when Taproots code is shipped, miners and node operators will have a time period of exactly three months to upgrade to Taproot before a timeout period is reached. If miners representing 90% of Bitcoins hashrate upgrade in this timeframe, then Taproot is locked in and it will activate three months after this lock-in. Assuming Taproot is shipped by May, this means the upgrade would be fully functional on the Bitcoin blockchain no later than November. We have two good options, and coin flip is people agreeing to put aside minute preferences on two acceptable options for the big picture, Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin wrote in a Bitcoin devlist email As such, I think that a coin flip is appropriately used in this circumstance, although I recognize the sentiment that some may feel its treating development a little too *flippantly*.

nasdaq,NotProvided,2021-04-05 23:00:00,3 Blockchain Stocks to Buy in 2021,"Blockchain is a record-keeping system first developed by the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. The premise is simple: Transactions are grouped into blocks, validated by miners, and stored in a chronological ""chain"" across all nodes (computers) in a network. This",". Here's what investors need to know about how blockchain could impact the futures of these three companies. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Microsoft In 2018, Microsoft partnered with the giant U.K. consultancy EY (still well-known by its former name, Ernst & Young) to build a blockchain network that automates video game royalty payments. Specifically, the network makes it possible to code smart digital contracts that self-execute as transactions occur, improving transparency and efficiency for Microsoft, game publishers, and developers. Publishers can now access royalty information in minutes, rather than the 45 days it took before. And Xbox finance operations are now 70% more efficient, according to Rohit Amberker, finance director of the Royalties and Content Operations team. This royalty payment solution is powered by Microsoft's Azure Blockchain Service, a platform that simplifies the development of blockchain networks and applications. But other customers use the service as well, and their solutions are equally impressive. For instance, General Electric Aviation has built a blockchain network to track airplane parts. That's important because airlines can't use any part unless they know its full history, which leads to substantial waste in the aviation industry. Notably, this solution allows the company to access verified data in real time, eliminating the need for inefficient tracking via paper documents. In fact, blockchain efficiencies could improve the industry's revenue by as much as 4% per year, or $40 billion, according to some analysts. Starbucks uses Azure blockchain technologies to ensure its products are sourced ethically. Using the mobile app, consumers can scan a code on the company's packaged coffee and find out exactly where the beans were grown. The network also allows farmers to trace the movements of what they produce, providing valuable transparency. For example, some farmers may not know their product is export grade, so this technology gives them insight into the quality of their beans. As more enterprises adopt blockchain-powered solutions, Microsoft's global cloud computing platform should make the company a key player in the space. 2. PayPal PayPal benefits from blockchain in a more traditional sense. In October, the company started allowing users in the U.S. to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin and three other digital currencies through the PayPal app. The company plans to bring the same functionality to Venmo and international markets in the coming months. Its fintech rival Square has allowed its Cash App users to trade Bitcoinsince 2018. Since that time, Cash App users and user engagement have both trended upward, driving a significant increase in gross profit. PayPal should see similar benefits in the coming quarters, but the company has even bigger plans. Last month, PayPal launched its Checkout with Crypto service, allowing consumers to make purchases with Bitcoin (and a few other digital currencies) directly from the PayPal app. Eventually, the company plans to make this option available for all of its 29 million merchants. That would be a big step toward legitimizing cryptocurrencyas a form of payment, and it could be a powerful growth driver for PayPal in the coming years. 3. Salesforce Salesforce helps its clients develop and maintain relationships with their own customers. Specifically, the Salesforce Customer 360 platform unifies data from sales, customer service, marketing, finance, and other departments, making it easy for different teams to work together. As part of Customer 360, Salesforce offers a low-code application platformthat makes it possible for anyone to develop software, even if they don't understand computer code. As a longtime innovator, Salesforce recognized blockchain's potential in 2019 and incorporated it into its low-code platform. Clients can now build blockchain-powered networks and applications through Salesforce, similar to the way Microsoft's clients use Azure Blockchain Service. While this hasn't been a notable growth driver so far, it adds substantial value to Salesforce's platform. Blockchain has the potential to reshape numerous industries, and Salesforce is well-positioned to capitalize on that trend. 10 stocks we like better than Microsoft When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The use of the tool, however, is spreading to sectors that are not necessarily linked to cryptocurrencies. With the arrival of the pandemic in Brazil, for example, blockchain is gaining more and more utility when being used for document authentication without having to leave home. One tool that is taking advantage of technology is e-Notoriado. In December last year, the digital authentication function was adopted by the platform and, in four months, about 156 thousand pages of documents have already been authenticated by the blockchain system. Thus, users can share the documents via WhatsApp, email, SMS or any other messaging application, which will continue to have the same legal value as the original file. But what is blockchain? The blockchain concept was born in 2008, with the creation of Bitcoin. The technology was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto, pseudonym of the supposed creator of the cryptocurrency, to prevent data from being altered, copied or exchanged in the virtual environment. As a result, transactions are safer, preventing a person from spending 1 BTC twice or saying that they sent 10 BTC and transferring a smaller amount, for example. To this day, the currencys cryptography is intact, with no successful attempt at fraud. In summary, the technology uses pieces of code generated online, connects the information in blocks, forming a chain. The trick here is that each block has information from the previous one, that is, if someone wants to invade the chain, they will need to unveil the code of all previous blocks. Blockchain Company Ripple's Value Reaches $ 10 Billion Blockchain on Authentications The authentication process, according to the President of Colgio Notarial do Brasil, Giselle Oliveira, is carried out through Notarchain, a private blockchain network of notaries. The process takes place in the same way: the requested document has a unique code that will be deposited in a block with all the transactions in that network. From there, a chain is built, in which each block is linked to the previous one, making it impossible to change the information that has already been stored. The document registered by user A in Minas Gerais can be verified by a notary at the request of user B in Tocantins. This user B, with the certified copy in PDF, can also request the printed document of the original document that it came from Minas Gerais, by user A, guaranteeing faithful reproduction and its legal effects , explains Oliveira. She explains that the process is fast, as well as the face-to-face procedure, but recommends that the service be scheduled in advance.

Digital currencies like Bitcoin work on whats called the blockchain. Thats a distributed digital ledger U.S. Rep. Bill Foster, D-Naperville, says is non-falsifiable. Something that you cannot go and make a counterfeit copy of something thats already been published on the blockchain, Foster said. And so that will prevent a lot of document fraud. With Chinas central bank looking at its own digital currency, Foster is pushing for Congress to investigate making a digital dollar in cooperation with the Federal Reserve central bank. The United States is playing catch-up to the rest of the world when it comes to digital currency, and if were going to protect the U.S. dollars status as the worlds reserve currency, we need to make development of secure and effective digital currency a priority, Foster said in a statement. In an interview, he said decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin are facilitating illicit actions. One of the border patrol agents told me that most of the payments made for human trafficking are now being made with Bitcoin, simply because it was not legally traceable, Foster said. Michael Busch, president and CEO of Burling Bank in Chicago, said what hes seen with digital currencies, the ledger is transparent and accountable. He also noted the U.S. dollar is being used for nefarious purposes. While we always have to be wary of bad actors, we cant let those concerns deter us from providing safe and sound products and services to compliant businesses, Busch said. Busch advocates for policies to foster the growth of blockchain technology in Illinois. Illinois lawmakers last month heard from Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations Chasse Rehwinkel about how such blockchain technology continues to be adopted by other states. Blockchain technology is not just being applied to financial institutions, but also its being looked at for government, healthcare, transpiration, different logistics issues, retail, travel and many other industries, Rehwinkel said. IDFPR produced a report at the end of last year with various recommendations Illinois could implement to foster blockchain technology and digital currencies. There is no general consensus among domestic regulatory bodies at either the state or federal level, according to the reports. However, certain states are making inroads in how to regulate this industry. Allowing banks and financial institutions to act as legal custodians for crypto-asset clients seems to be the regulatory path that both industry advocates and regulators want to pursue.",https://www.gmtoday.com/news/illinois/illinois-officials-evaluating-how-to-facilitate-blockchain-technology-digital-currency/article_8a485ae0-9484-11eb-b1d8-375d0ae6dfb7.html

But the real game changer could be the underlying blockchain technology. In this Fool Live video clip, recorded on March 18, Gemini cryptocurrency exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss explains to The Motley Fool's Anand Chokkavelu why decentralized finance is such an important innovation. Anand Chokkavelu: What's something in the blockchain/crypto universe most people today can't envision at all, but will take for granted five years from now? Cameron Winklevoss: I think one of the most interesting developments has been decentralized finance. That's really had a boon over the past year, where people are building projects that are permissionless, where you can lend and borrow funds. You can trade. You can just show up to these smart contracts and send your collateral in and transact, you don't actually need permission to do that. It's really rearchitecting big pieces of the financial system in a decentralized, permissionless manner, which is super exciting, and it's all being built on Ethereum. I think the next question a lot of people would have would be, ""How do I invest in this wave?"" The simplest answer is that you could invest in projects directly, but then you have to pick winners, so to speak. If you think of Ethereum as basically this decentralized computer, and Ethereum is like Manhattan, and buying ether is like buying a parcel of land, and these projects are like skyscrapers. By owning the land as people build on top of it, build these skyscrapers, that brings value to you as a property holder. Really the weighted index DeFi, which I think is one of the most important frontiers being built in crypto today. You can simply buy Ethereum, and then you have a pro rata share of this piece of land that all this good stuff being built on top of it. A lot of that value accrues to ether holders, because these projects require you to use ether to use them. So they are ether eaters, and they create demand. What we've been telling folks, and again, this is not financial advice, just want to say that. A lot of folks approach us and they say, ""Hey, how should I enter crypto?"" Our view is Bitcoin's the entry point, it's the store of value, it's the oldest, it's the most liquid, it has the largest market cap. We've been in it personally for almost nine years now. Bitcoin's really the starting point, but Ethereum is a place where it makes a lot of sense to have chips on the board. Whether that's a 70-30 breakdown between Bitcoin or Ethereum, or 60-40, 50-50, that's a personal decision. I think that's what we've been discussing with folks who ask us, how do I approach this space? Because Ethereum indexes so much of this amazing activity that's going on, and then Bitcoin is that digital gold. I think if you look at the performance, Bitcoin's done incredibly well, and Ethereum's done well, too. I think individuals are well served to look at both of those projects. This article represents the opinion of the writer, who may disagree with the official recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service. Were motley! Questioning an investing thesis -- even one of our own -- helps us all think critically about investing and make decisions that help us become smarter, happier, and richer.

But the industry needs to have a robust security apparatus in place. As the demand for cryptocurrencies increased, it was accompanied by increased cases of hackers breaking into the networks. It is astonishing to know that there around 29 incidents of hacking in the Bitcoin industry between 2013-17. The incidents of hacking into digital assets of crypto networks rose to around US$ 1.8 billion in the first ten months of 2020. Hackers are using newer methods to lure crypto traders and laying their hands-on digital assets. Crypto exchanges must ensure they secure their networks and the primary way to do this is to install an SSL certificate The incidents of hacking do not discriminate between regions or the stature of the exchange. For example, there have been hacking incidents at KuCoin  among the largest in South East Asia. There was also an attack at Exmo  registered in the UK and serves clients in Ukraine and Russia. This article will delve deep into how the use of Blockchain can help in internet security. INTRODUCTION TO THE FUTURE OF SSL CERTIFICATES Like all other industries, it is the sense of trust that brings users to any crypto exchange. It will help in building an ideal relationship between the exchange and the customers. As there is an increase in attacks, users must check the websites they are visiting. One of the common ways hackers use to target your assets is to use a URL like the renowned crypto exchanges. There have been several incidents where this was done, including the attack on Binance. Crypto exchanges must also imbibe security best practices to thwart such data breaches. Apart from the loss of trust, it can also lead to hefty fines and permanent brand image loss. Why are SSL Certificates Important? In general, it is necessary for organizations running an online business to provide adequate security for their customers. Usually, online shops store a lot of personal information about their customers. Hackers are always on the prowl to gain unauthorized access to such critical data. In the case of crypto exchanges, they store financial information too about the customers. It becomes necessary for crypto exchanges to provide a secure site that will ensure that the customers can transact without the fear of their digital assets being accessed by hackers. With an increase in the number of hacking incidents, visitors to any website also look for the address bars padlock sign and HTTPS. It helps ensure that the website they are visiting has security in place to prevent data sniffing. SSL certificates are used on websites that allow customers to transact online. Financial institutions, e-commerce sites, social networks, etc., all use them to ensure proper security is in place for web security. It will help to create a safe connection between the web server and the browser. When a customer makes a payment, the financial information will be encrypted before it is sent to the server. What is Blockchain? One of the issues with SSL certificates is that it is based on Certificate Authorities (CAs) who have to issue certificates but may fail to adhere to the validation process. It can be adequately addressed using blockchain technology. The procedure used in this technology can be used to secure digital communication and can also be used for authentication. Blockchain is a verified record of any critical data. The data blocks are all in chronological order, and they cannot be altered or modified over time. It is a decentralized public ledger that can be shared among users to form an array of transactions. They are timestamped and permanently connected to the previous chain. It uses cryptography that uses a different key to encrypt and decrypt data. As a result, it can also protect the completed transactions and prevent any changes. Blockchain also ensures the security of the data across the network. The entities can have their unique cryptographic keys that can be used to verify and, hence, secure the underlying information. How can Blockchain help in Cybersecurity? Decentralisation. One of the essential benefits is that you do not need any third-party verification due to the P2P (peer-to-peer) network. Any user can see the network transactions. Moreover, there is no central storage location, and all users can store some portions or the whole portion of the Blockchain. The users have to verify the data shared or stored to prevent any unauthorized data from being added. Confidentiality. Blockchain uses a public-key cryptography mechanism that can be used to authenticate the participants. The details of the participants are kept confidential, and their operations are being encrypted too. The Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) can verify the digital signatures validity without disclosing the keys. Integrity. There is a distributed register that ensures data protection and prevents any unauthorized access and alteration. The use of Blockchain ensures the irreversibility and validity of the completed transactions. Even during any DDoS attack, the system can continue to work in the normal mode. Fraud prevention. To corrupt a blockchain, hackers have to destroy the data that is stored at all the locations. It is challenging to bring down entire networks as the chains can be stored on several computers. The complexity of penetrating more extensive networks makes it have a lower risk of attack from hackers. Why is there a need to use Blockchain-based systems? The SSL/ TLS technology has been in use for a long time and is still a widely used technology for the internet. One of the critical factors of this technology is that centralized CAs issued it. However, the Heartbleed bug of OpenSSL had businesses scrambling to reissue their SSL certificates. There was an inherent to search for more advanced technologies. The use of Blockchain will help to secure digital transactions. The Blockchain Originated Certificate of Authenticity (BOCA) can help secure online information transfer across different websites. This protocol utilizes advanced technologies to validate users and ensure that the underlying user details are secure. Wherever Blockchain has been used, it improves the authentication mechanism that can be done without passwords. The PKI technology used in SSL/TLS is vulnerable to cyberattacks and is not used in Blockchain. On the other hand, Blockchain can be updated only through proper consensus. The various participants must consent to any changes in the chain, and anything entered in the chain cannot be altered. They can be verified and audited easily. Blockchain can also preserve the metadata that is being used in the interaction and can help to prevent any data breach. One of the other factors to consider is that Blockchain must observe the regulations that require complying with Anti-Money Laundering and the Know Your Customer norms. The technology cannot act as the validating authority like the CAs who can manually verify the legit",https://signalscv.com/2021/04/the-future-of-ssl-certificates-is-it-blockchain/

The governments 7 billion rand ($474 million) commitment required a material change to previous versions of plans to deliver on the lenders development and transformation objective, it said in response to emailed questions.An agreement would have bought the state-owned bank more time in servicing a facility with Standard Chartered, the lone holdout from the restructuring talks, after a court ordered it pay back 400 million rand in December. Land Bank has now pledged to pay the remaining 352 million rand it owes to Standard Chartered by Thursday.Related: Moodys Withdraws All Ratings for South Africas Land BankThe bank continues to engage with the rest of its financial creditors to ensure that the interests of all parties are prudently served, it said.In DefaultLand Bank has been battling to repay its debt and extend credit since a drought caused many of its customers to default on their loans. Last April, the Pretoria-based institution missed a loan repayment that triggered a cross-default in notes issued under a 50 billion-rand bond program.The bank has been in talks with a consortium of creditors for about a year and is negotiating its third proposal to emerge from default.While Standard Chartereds success in court could spur other creditors to seek similar recourse, only a minority would likely consider this option, according to Jones Gondo, a credit research analyst at Nedbank Ltd.What should guide creditors now is the approach that will maximize their recovery, Gondo said.Standard Chartered declined to comment.The London-based banks history in South Africa spans 150 years. It divested in 1987 when it sold its stake in Standard Bank Group but returned five years later independently and was granted a full-service banking license in 2003. Its business in the country is now mainly focused on corporate and institutional banking activities, according to its website.Lifeline to FarmersLand Bank extends credit to commercial and emerging black farmers as South Africa aims to redress imbalances from racial-segregation policies ended in 1994. It must now decide how it will manage these dual interests, and quickly.A breakthrough in negotiations with creditors would bode well for confidence as South Africa looks to stabilize other larger state-owned companies such as power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. The nations finances have been strained by support to unprofitable state-owned companies, deep-seated corruption and a wage bill that has jumped 40% over the past 12 years.The manner in which the government is approaching Land Bank, however, is probably related to how much of its capital structure it guarantees, Gondo said.Eskom is different because of the guarantees, he said. In short, the National Treasury behaves differently depending on its contingent risk assessment.Land Bank expects its eventual agreement with lenders to shape its balance-sheet resizing and other strategic choices, it said.There are concerns about the time its taking to get to a solution, as well as the increased complexity and increased uncertainty introduced by the most recent version of its proposal, Olga Constantatos, head of credit at Futuregrowth Asset Management, said in a note.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 18h ago Princes Late-Night Dividend Announcement May Help Aramco (Bloomberg) -- The Saudi Arabian crown princes late-night announcement that Aramco could reduce payouts to the state will potentially alleviate the strain on the oil giants balance sheet.The details are still unclear -- the move took investors by surprise and the company said on Thursday it was still committed to paying dividends.But the move could free up some of the $73.5 billion of annual dividend payments Aramco makes to the government, which owns 98% of the company. Payouts to minority shareholders, who get roughly $1.5 billion, will be maintained -- as promised in the terms of a 2019 initial public offering.The worlds largest oil company has seen its debt levels soar in the last year due to the coronavirus-triggered collapse in energy prices and its $69 billion acquisition of chemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp. The Dhahran-based firm had to cut spending and borrow more to pay the dividend for 2020, with free cash flow falling substantially below that level to $49 billion.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said on Tuesday that 24 of the kingdoms biggest companies could decrease their dividends and instead contribute 5 trillion riyals ($1.33 trillion) of domestic capital spending over the next 10 years. Around 60% of that money will come from Aramco and Sabic, the 35-year-old de facto ruler said.He said the extra investment from the firms would boost the economy.Capex only drives higher long-term growth if it is on productive projects which create value and jobs, said Hasnain Malik, the head of research at Tellimer in Dubai. Otherwise, this is simply a case of the government reallocating capital in a centralized, command-economy fashion, further neutering the private sector.The prince didnt specify by how much Aramco might cut its government payout, or whether the company could retain some of the money on its balance sheet instead of investing it all.Aramcos dividends represent about one third of the Saudi governments total revenue.The firm remains committed to ensuring free cash flow to support dividend distributions through various market conditions and crude oil price cycles, it said in a statement to Bloomberg on Thursday.Aramcos shares rose 2.7% on Tuesday, the most since May, to 36 riyals. Trading volumes were more than four times the average of the past month, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.The new plan comes after the pandemic and oil shock pushed Saudi Arabia into recession and set back the governments goal of slashing unemployment and diversifying the economy.Aramco said earlier this month that capital spending in 2021 would be $35 billion, down from earlier guidance of as much as $45 billion. The company has a raft of projects on the horizon, including fulfilling a government edict to increase its total oil production capacity to 13 million barrels a day, from 12 million a day.(Updates with company comments in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 9h ago Billionaire Westons Trade Food for Property, Seeking Growth (Bloomberg) -- Groceries helped the billionaire Weston fa",http://finance.yahoo.com/news/future-fintech-stock-trading-higher-124412814.html

MDA had sought to raise about C$500 million by selling shares for C$16 to C$20 apiece, according to earlier materials.MDA will list on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MDA, marking a return for an iconic Canadian company once known as MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates. The IPO values the Brampton, Ontario-based company at C$1.6 billion when the sale closes around April 7, based on about 115 million shares outstanding.The banks that arranged the sale have an option to sell an additional 15% of the offering after the close, which could lift proceeds to C$460 million. The IPO was led by Bank of Montreal, Morgan Stanley and Bank of Nova Scotia.MDA plans to use about C$340 million of the proceeds to repay debt and the rest to fund ongoing growth initiatives, including the development of a next-generation commercial satellite, according to the filing.MDA specializes in space robotics, satellite systems and satellite imagery analysis. Its products include a global maritime information platform for vessel detection and climate monitoring, sensors for space missions and the robotic Canadarm used in NASAs Space Shuttle program and later on the International Space Station.(Updates with final sale documents, valuation in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 14h ago AMC Entertainment Seeks Approval to Sell 500 Million New Shares (Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is seeking investor approval to issue as many as 500 million new shares, an opportunity for a financial cushion while the theater chain works to draw fans back to the movies.Management doesnt necessarily intend to sell the new shares immediately, but wants the option to do so, Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said Thursday in an interview on CNBC. The company announced the effort in a regulatory filing last month.AMC could use the shares to bolster its cash reserve, buy back debt at a discount, settle deferred theater rents or pursue an acquisition, Aron said. The shares have soared over the past six months, benefiting from a Reddit-fueled investing frenzy that sent heavily shorted stocks into the stratosphere.There are a lot of good reasons for shareholders to give us the authority, Aron said.Shares of the Leawood, Kansas-based company fell as much as 6.4% to $9.56 in New York. The companys 12% second-lien notes due 2026 rose more than a cent on the dollar to a high of 82.88 cents, according to Trace bond trading data.AMC has raised more than $1 billion in financing this year, which helped stave off bankruptcy while its theaters were closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company said previously it might seek more financing, and some creditors have suggested it sell more shares to pay down debt.Theater chains have been hard hit by government-mandated shutdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic. While the company has been able to reopen all but a small portion of its locations, its still operating at limited capacity to ensure extra space for customers, and many moviegoers have been reluctant to attend. The problem has been compounded by studios delaying major releases that drive ticket sales.AMCs shares traded at historic lows for much of 2020 as the Covid-19 crisis engulfed the company.

What Happened: The company said that it more-than-doubled the number of BTC it held on its balance sheet at 1,078 BTC as of Dec. 31, as compared to 514 BTC on the same date a year earlier. BTC traded 0.43% higher at $59,127.58 making Riots holdings worth nearly $63.74 million at press time. Riot reported an increase in mining revenues by 116% to $5.2 million in Q4 2020 compared to $2.4 million for the preceding quarter. The company minted 303 BTC now worth $17.91 million in Q4, an increase of 36% over the Q3 figure of 222 BTC ($13.08 millionat press time). Riot said the increase in minting was driven primarily by the increase in the Companys hash rate combined with network hash rate and adjustments in network difficulty. Hash rate implies the total computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain such as one that underpins Bitcoin. Total mining revenue in 2020 was $12 million, which is a 78% year-on-year increase compared to the $6.7 million figure recorded in 2019.

One of its advantages is a more eco-friendly design, as Enjin has released a five-step plan to enable carbon-neutral NFTs by 2030. To date, the company has raised $37.8 million. Above: Enjin hopes South Korean gamers will be into its NFTs. Image Credit: Enjin One of the problems of early blockchain cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin is that they require lots of computing power to mine coins and verify authenticity, based on the  proof of work  design that required miners to solve complex computing puzzles. (The blockchain is a transparent and secure ledger that can be verified by pools of computers working together.) But Enjin is moving to proof-of-stake, where the blockchain verification depends on a smaller number of trusted computing partners to verify data. That method of verification doesnt use as much energy. The challenge is that not as many users are familiar with Enjin, in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Caleb Applegate, chief operating officer at Enjin, said in a statement that NFTs should be for everyone. And building with Polkadot will enable Enjin to deliver an accessible, scalable solution that empowers everyone to participate in the emerging NFT economy. With the end-user in mind, Efinity will provide a fun, simple, and accessible experience for all, he said. While transactions on Ethereum are slow at 15 per second, Efinity is set to process transactions every 6 seconds and will use proof of stake to scale to 1,000 transactions per second. Enjin is also developing a new cross-chain token standard called Paratoken that will enable any fungible or non-fungible token from any blockchain to be moved onto the Efinity network and then used throughout the Polkadot ecosystem. Paratokens are an advancement of the ERC-1155 NFT standard that Enjin pioneered in 2017, which has since been adopted by companies like Microsoft, Nike, and OpenSea. Above: Enjins Efinity Image Credit: Enjin Enjin has hundreds of thousands of communities on its platform, with more than 20 million users on the original platform. The company switched to NFTs four years ago and built an ecosystem to enable developers to add blockchain to their games. About 40 game companies are using it so far, and Enjin has built bridges to other platforms such as Ethereum. Digital assets should exist in a metaverse of blockchains, said Witek Radomski, chief technology officer of Enjin, in a statement. He said that opening up liquidity across multiple blockchains and use-cases will connect a broad ecosystem of creators, buyers, and sellers. The team has released a whitepaperdetailing the new Efinity Token (EFI), designed for transaction fees, liquidity, and yield farming through staking Enjin Coin (ENJ). Community governance will enable EFI holders to submit and vote on proposals to steer the future of the network. Initially, Enjin has allocated 15% of the total supply of EFI that users can earn by staking ENJ on Efinity and minting tokens with ENJ. ENJ stakers will also earn EFI collected from network fees, marketplace commissions, cross-chain bridging tolls, and smart contract fees. Enjin will invest further development into Snowforks open-source bridges to enable NFTs to flow between Polkadot, Ethereum, and other blockchains. Starting with NFT.io, marketplaces on Efinity will reward bidders with EFI, creating perpetual liquidity for all assets and allowing collectors to see an up-to-date valuation of their NFT portfolios.

Retailers will also benefit, with 62% of them expecting to increase their overall sales. However, todays shoppers are more sophisticated. They are demanding more, such as lower costs, increased control and other options. They are increasingly seeking simplicity, convenience and options to meet their needs. Logistics companies must follow suit, Schmahl said. In addition to using technology to help optimize delivery locations, logistics companies must also leverage new technologies to optimize delivery methods, he continued, adding: Going forward, we expect emerging technologies like blockchain will continue to help boost growth among logistics companies working together for different parts of a packages journey. Logistics Companies Need to Step Up Efforts Schmahl said logistics companies ability to provide on-time deliveries currently onlymeets a minimum standard of success. He suggested various ways for them to keep up with customers demands.Harnessing the power of multiple delivery channels can be powerful year-round, but it will be a particularly essential tool during the peak holiday season, he noted as oneexample. How Blockchains Can Help Logistics Last month, PwC published a reporton the future of the logisticsindustry. The firm claimed blockchain technology can enhance supply chain security and reducefraud. It can also cutbottlenecks, including third-party certification. While it will increase efficiency, it will also reduce errors by eliminatingpaper-based documentation. Blockchain-based logistics solutions are developed by start-ups, PwC said. They focus on areas such as digitized trade documents, chain of custody, customs clearance, and trade finance. The technology has many benefits such as fostering automation and efficiency in addition to reducing delays, human error and transaction costs.

Priority Title & Escrow already handles deed ownership on a national level, as part of its work as a full service title company. In a press releaseissued Monday, Ubitquity founder and CEO Nathan Wosnack said, &ldquo; Having trusted partners to secure verifiable title information to Ubitquity continues the transition of a centuries-old paper title system to a new information age system. The company had announcedthe prototype of its real estate platform in March, with a limited release for select real estate and title companies appearing last month. Its debut with Priority Title & Escrow marks a US market integration for its full-service Blockchain title register, with Wosnack confident that Blockchain&rsquo;s potential could quickly reshape how business is conducted in the sector. Ubitquity will simplify the process of tracking and recording to enable a long-term chain of custody of title, he continued. By recording this and all future documents/events in that propertys future, a publicly accessible, immutable record on the blockchain is created, making future transfer easier and less costly to research. He added that Priority Title & Escrow &ldquo;will help to legitimize this important process. Future Of Deed Transfer Depends On Trust Blockchain real estate is itself in a nascent phase. Other initial implementations are occurring outside the US, for example in Dutch startup Biccurs Blandlord which will allow shareholding in international property using Blockchain as proof-of-ownership. LaMontagnes enthusiasm could easily prove infectious. Real estate deeds are an area still marred by legacy system inefficiency, leading to poor value for money in countries like the US and even large-scalefraud elsewhere. The future of Settlements will be determined by our ability to create a trusted and secure way to sign, notarized and record our closing documents. The blockchain has immense untapped value as it relates to all three aspects, LaMontagne said. Ubitquity meanwhile has had a busy few months since its Marchprototype release.

For the first time, a real estate agency isoffering a property for asan asset exchange. Also read: Russian Govt Regulator Launches Blockchain Project with Sberbank A Russian Apartment for 77 Bitcoins October 3 saw what is likely the first ever official Russian real estate listingfor bitcoins. An apartment in the city of Ekaterinburg in the countrys Ural mountains is currently available for 2.9 million rubles  or the less daunting 77 BTC The host agency, Obmenkvartir (Russian for property exchange), describes the listing as an exclusive offer for those lucky holders of cryptocurrency. Suchnews from the consumer sphere may be modest, and may remain a one-off for some time. However as a test case for the countrys changing attitudes towards cryptocurrency, it provides pause for thought. Russias relationship with Bitcoin  as opposed to blockchain technology  has been notable for authorities seemingly contradictory behaviour regarding itslegal status. While the government has passed no hard-and-fast rules to make Bitcoin illegal in Russia, it has reiteratedthat the ruble is the only legal currency for domestic transactions. As a consequence,experts and consumers alike understand that offering payment in bitcoin could have negative legal consequences. Asset Exchange As a Bitcoin Backdoor? Indeed, the apartment offeringcannot constitute a Bitcoin sale in the true sense. As the name of the host website suggests, the offer is (in the legal sense) simply an exchange. The exchange of assets in Russia is not prohibited, Evgeniy Bolotin, deputy chairman of the Ural Banking Union toldnews resource RG.ru. In our country, the only legal currency for making payments is the Russian ruble, so this deal can only qualify as an exchange. Nonetheless, that the listing still exists aftertwo weekscontrastsprevious events. Local lawmakers have, in the past, successfully blocked access to websites simply providing information about cryptocurrency. Some did not even offer consumer transactions. Legal Gray Area Still Exists The trend continues. Most recently in September, access to popular exchange resource Localbitcoins was blockedacross the country. However, Localbitcoinswas able to create a workaround using a mirror sitein a countermove. This again emphasized the complex nature of what a legal ban really implicates. At the same time, Moscows most recent statements suggest that truly criminalizing cryptocurrency use is not on the cards for now. Trading, in the words of deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev, isallowed, butmining would remain illegal. This preserved the issue as a gray area, which is set to continue.

Read more...,"Next Article: FOX Studios to Make a Movie on Silk Road with the Coen Brothers The interest in cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology is at an all-time high. While the climbing Bitcoin price stands proof to the increasing interest in the digital currency, at least 100 research and white papers published by various banking and financial institutions vouch for blockchain technology. The global economy is based on a centralized model, but increasingly the Central Banks that play a major role in monetary policies are focusing towards the implementation of blockchain based systems across their network. Most Central Banks dont have the intention to recognize or allow the adoption of Bitcoin, mainly due to its global and decentralized nature. But the distributed ledger and its potential to simplify the record keeping, tracking and accounting process makes it hard to ignore. This has got Central Banks, especially the Bank of Englandand the Peoples Bank of Chinato consider issuing the national currencies in a digital form over blockchain. What Makes Blockchain Technology So Exciting? For starters, the inherent property of immutability and transparency associated with Bitcoin blockchain makes it easier for the central banks to trace the money thats in circulation. The use of blockchain based digital fiat currency will reduce the amount of bank notes and coins that are in circulation. This will, in turn, reduce the operating costs associated with printing and distribution of currency notes by the central bank. The wide spread implementation of blockchain based fiat currency will also help the central banks and governments fight money laundering while eliminating the issue of counterfeiting. It will also drastically reduce the transmission costs and time associated with cross-border transfers, by enabling instant transfers between branches both within and outside the country. In one of the media reports The Governor of Federal Reserve in-charge of overseeing new technologies, Lael Brainard was quoted saying, We are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology or blockchain, recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in payments, clearing and settlement. She continued, innovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society. Incidentally, US Federal Reserve is not the only one. The R3 international blockchain consortium already has major names from the private banking and financial sector working together on creating blockchain applications. Similar consortiums have been set up in Russia and China with the blessings of their respective central banks. In the coming days, the gradual shift from legacy systems based banking operations to blockchain based operations will become visible.

Also read: Smithsonian Museum Features Bitcoin in Historical Money Exhibit IBM Injects $200M Into German IoT Branch The multinational tech giant is racing towards blockchain technology at a fast pace. Recently, the firm created a global Watson IoT headquarters in Munich where it studies and develops IoT protocols. IoT technology will incorporate embedded chips and software incars, machines, hospital equipment, and household appliances. IBM says it created the German headquarters because of the escalating demand from customers who are looking to transform their operations using a combination of IoT and Artificial Intelligence. Distributed ledger technology tethered to IoT can create a more efficient relationship between chips and software, IBM says. The company has already been full steam ahead in research and development for its own blockchain protocol. Additionally, IBM recently testeda smart contract prototype with the Japan-based Mitsubishi UFJ. The firm also believes65 percent of major banks will be using distributed ledgers by 2019. The German IoT subsidiary considers blockchain to be a key element to building a distributed network of devices. Harriet Green, Global Head of IBMs Watson IoT business, said during the announcement: Germany is at the forefront of the Industry 4.0 initiative and by inviting our clients and partners to join us in Munich, we are opening up our talent and technologies to help deliver on the promise of IoT and establishing a global hotbed for collaborative innovation. IoT and Blockchain Prototypes Already Created Back in January 2015, IBM revealedits ADEPT proof of concept. The project, in partnership with Samsung, tethers blockchain technology and IoT. The two companies tested smart contracts with Ethereum and low-cost solutions to automate devices. IoT framework has particular challenges though, which IBM believes blockchain tech could benefit. ADEPT looks at the ability to scale, trust, cost, authentication, and interoperability. IBMs report titled Device Democracy explained: The expected proliferation of hundreds of billions more places is at the threshold of a transformation sweeping across the electronics industry and many others. Yet, the dream of a smart, safe and efficient future is threatened by subscription fees, ubiquitous advertising and intrusive surveillance. Our study shows that a low-cost, private-by-design democracy of devices will emerge that will enable new digital economies and create new value while offering consumers and enterprises fundamentally better products and user experiences. IBM Watson IoT Team 6,000 Clients Will Tap Into Watson IoT Services The cognitive IoT Collaboratories in Munich will apply blockchain and IoT for its 6,000 clients worldwide. Thoseresearchers, engineers and developers will look at integrating the IBM distributed ledgerto transfer IoT data efficiently. Moreover, many other companies are joining forces tocollaborate on R&D. Businesses participating include the German automotive supplier Schaeffler, Dutch aircraft designer Aerialtronics, and Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals With Watson IoT and IBM&rsquo;s blockchain, these companies can reportedly share IoT data securely, and privately. IBM claims Watson clients will see reduced costs and complexities while doing business across this network. Furthermore, Kouvola Innovation (Kinno), an economic development company based in Finland, has already used the Watson IoT blockchainimplementation. While utilizing the technology Kinno is tracking, monitoring, container statuses and location. IBM says this optimizes packing and transfer of shipments through shipping lanes.

In fact earlier this year a group of blockchain and digital currency advocates spoke to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen. The Chamber of Digital Commercerepresentatives and guests of central bankers from 90 countries discussed the future of these protocols.   Brainard says that distributed ledger technology could help cross-border record-keeping. Benefits include lower risks and secure transactions within marketsand automated smart contracts. The Governor explained to attendees: We recognize the potential of distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, to transform the way financial market participants transfer, store, and maintain ownership. At the same time, we want to maintain public confidence. Governor Says Blockchain Still Needs To Prove Potential Lael Brainard, Federal Reserve Brainard told the crowd that the technology still has to prove itself. This would include protection againstdata breaches, hacks, and regulatoryconcerns. Potential applications are in their infancy, and the industry may still be several years away from an application that is ready to be fully implemented, said Brainard. The Governor explained that financial tech is new and therefore incorporates a lot of risks. Later this year the Fed plans on releasing its blockchain research paper by the end of the year. Brainard also detailed many of the scenarios blockchain technology could affect positively within traditional trade finance. Initial relatively simple proofs of concept must be followed by much more complex demonstrations in real-world situations before these technologies can be safely deployed in todays highly interconnected, synchronized and far-reaching financial markets, he said. The Research Continues The Fed has been setting its sights on blockchain technology for quite some time. In March researchers from the New York Federal Reserve issued a report called Is Bitcoin Really Frictionless? The paper described the many spot ranges in value between three leading Bitcoin exchanges. The report concluded blockchain technology was impressive, but the cryptocurrency Bitcoin wasnt really frictionless. Some believe the Fed will someday issue its own centralized digital currency Indeed, the notion of a Fedcoin has been talked about by other central banks around the world.

The price of Bitcoin lately does seem to track to a certain extent the dollar price of the Yuan, and it makes sense that Bitcoin could be used as a tool to exceed money exchange limits set by Chinese regulators, Investopedia adds. If true, the price of Bitcoin may spike once again the next time the CNY is lowered.

It is our goal to enable the gaming platform to hold universally operable functionalities. The key premise of Book of Orbs centers around the counterparty exchange of game items on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Project Orb seeks to revolutionize the concept of true digital ownership for game players, everywhere. So heres what you need to know before downloading the app: What is ORB? ORB is an acronymization of our Project ORB mission statement.

Counterparty refers to an open-source, tokenization platform built atop of the Bitcoin blockchain. You can learn more about Counterparty at the official website, www.counterparty.io. Why do I need to pay bitcoin fees when I want to send and/or trade my ORBs? ORBS on Books of Orbs refer to tokens built atop of the Bitcoin Blockchain, using the counterparty protocol. To send and trade ORBs, you have to pay a small fee to Bitcoin miners; this allows for the timely confirmation of your transaction. Why do I need to wait 10 minutes or more, to send or place an order? As ORBs operate on the bitcoin blockchain, their transaction process follows the same procedure and resultant waiting periods.

If you believe that there are other circumstances behind your transaction failure, please do not hesitate to contact our support services via our social networks or email. Why are transaction fees expensive sometimes? Higher transaction fees occur when the Bitcoin network becomes congested. This is often due to limited block capacity on the blockchain. To ensure that ORB transactions are still confirmed in a timely manner, a higher transaction fee will be incurred for users. Can I send ORBs to other bitcoin wallets? ORBs can be sent to other Bitcoin wallets and will not be destroyed even if theyre sent to non-counterparty addresses. However, retrieving tokens from these addresses may require the assistance of a specialized, cryptographic tool. Can I cancel my order?

Defense Coalitions Play a Key Role in Innovation Coin Centers executive director Jerry Brito Brito announced the organization via the Coin Center blog. Brito compared DCLDC to advocacy groups like the ACLU, the Institute for Justice, and the EFF. He said the coalition will use its united effort to protect the rights of those participating in the digital currency and blockchain space. The team of 50 lawyers will make pro bono attorney referrals to those who cant afford these types of services. Additionally, Brito explained the group will submit amicus briefs on key blockchain industry issues. Headded that when the web first became successful, collaborative efforts also helped protect peoples rights. Brito said: The early Internet could not have reached the kind of global scale we see today without the work of motivated entrepreneurs and tinkerers. Historically, defense coalitions similar to the DCLDC have played a key role in keeping the way free for innovators pushing the envelope to build out promising network technologies. Are Lobby Groups, Public Policy Organizations, and Defense Coalitions Necessary? Not everyone in the cryptocurrency community, however, is pumped about these coalitions.

The global payments landscape is primarily dominated by Visa and MasterCard, in that order. In a time @sambdas Rob Reeg, president for operations and technology at multinational payments giant Mastercard has revealed that while the company is invested in blockchain technology, he doesnt care for Bitcoin. The global payments landscape is primarily dominated by Visa and MasterCard, in that order. In a time where a disruptive new innovation like Bitcoin has already scaled and survived beyond many observers expectations, it is perhaps prudent that the giants take notice. Visa, for instance, summed up 2015in noting that bitcoin and blockchain became more real than ever before, as the year that saw blockchain as an innovation that the industry has to live with. The payments leader has also notably sought talentfor developing and researching virtual currencies, blockchain and other emerging payment technologies. Furthermore, the company is already pooling in engineersto develop blockchain technology, with one proof-of-concept already seekingparticipants among European banks. Meanwhile, Mastercard also has a track record in acknowledging bitcoin and blockchain technology, in its own way. A notable instance of telling insight on the way MasterCard views bitcoin came to the fore when the payments company respondedto an official UK Government public call for information on digital currencies. [W]e would argue that, when compared to Mastercards network, the claims pertaining to the speed and safety for digital currencies does not hold up, MasterCard wrote in response. The company also questioned the security of the bitcoin blockchain and argued that the current network of global transactions go through a regulated environment, instead of relying on a block chain process. Suffice to say, MasterCard doesnt think much of Bitcoin, from its downbeat response to the UK governments call to garner insights and opinions on digital currencies, last year. That dismissive outlook toward Bitcoin hasnt changed and seemingly permeates among the top executive channels in the company. During an interview with Indian publication the Business Standard Rob Reeg MasterCard president for operations and technology, was asked about blockchain technology and Mastercards endeavors with the technology, if any. To this, Reeg answered: It is an interesting technology and we are working on it. I personally dont care about Bitcoin, but I do care about blockchain technology. The dismissive take on bitcoin coincides with that of a prominent Wall Street executive, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has previously stated that bitcoin wasnt going anywhere further labelling the cryptocurrency a waste of timeon a separate occasion. While unsolicited, Reegs flat denial of bitcoin was followed by the revelation that MasterCard was working on two blockchain pilot projects, one a combination of private and public (permissioned and permission-less) blockchain, the other a private blockchain. Perhaps revealing further insights into why a public blockchain, like bitcoin, wasnt in the list of priorities for Mastercard, Reeg stated: For [a] company like us, while managing peoples money and information, [the] security aspect of blockchain is [a] little bit daunting. The idea behind blockchain is unregulated power, but that is never going to be a first choice when the security is [of] concern. The executives opinion about security and the suppposed safety net of regulation comes  during a time that sees financial services institutions fined billionsfor facilitating money-laundering swindling moneyfrom everyday citizens and racially discriminatingagainst minorities. These instances are a fraction of the banks and financial institutions that were caught, within the past 10 years. Unregulated power governed by code could be exactly what the world needs.

Bitcoin was last trading down 10% at $53,991 as of 1320 GMT, a whopping $12,000 below record highs set on Wednesday. Smaller rival Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, dropped 10% to $2,101. Data website CoinMarketCap cited blackout in Chinas Xinjiang region, which reportedly powers a lot of bitcoin mining, for the selloff. Luke Sully, CEO at digital asset treasury specialist Ledgermatic, said in an email that people may have sold on the news of the power outage in China and not the impact it actually had on the network. The power outage does expose a fundamental weakness; that although the Bitcoin network is decentralized the mining of it is not, Sully added. Some widely-followed blockchain analysts on Twitter pointed to a sharp drop in hash rate due to the outage. Hash rate refers to the volatility index that measures the processing capacity of the entire Bitcoin network, and it determines the power required by miners to produce new Bitcoins. Typically shocks to hash rate do not cause price drops. A hash rate reduction slows transactions, which ironically makes it harder to move coins to exchanges for sale. The recent price drop is well within the bounds of typical volatility, it is noise not signal, said Edan Yago, co-founder at Bitcoin-based decentralised finance protocol Sovryn. The retreat in Bitcoin also comes after Turkeys central bank banned the use of cryptocurrencies for purchases on Friday. Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said cryptocurrencies had been ripe for a pullback. The market has become overly aggressive and bullish on everything, said Edward Moya. It could have been any bearish headline that could have triggered this reaction. Many cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7, setting the stage for price swings at unpredictable hours. Historically, retail and day traders have driven the moves. Despite the sudden selloff, bitcoin is still up 89% so far in 2021, driven by its mainstream acceptance as an investment and a means of payment, accompanied by the rush of retail cash into stocks, exchange-traded funds and other risky assets.",https://arynews.tv/en/bitcoin-slump-pullback-blockchain-network-cryptocurrency/

Dreamstime Add Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency wallet provider, to the list of companies weighing initial public offerings now that Coinbase Global has successfully navigated its trip to the public equity markets. Blockchain.com, of London, is a financial services company that is known for building crypto wallets for users to send, receive, and manage their Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, and ether. It employs about 200 people. The startup is contemplating life as a public company, according to co-founder and CEO Peter Smith. We would consider an IPO someday. But were not in a rush, Smith told Barrons. When asked about the timing of a possible Blockchain.com IPO, Smith said: Well have to wait and see. Blockchain.com is carefully considering its public-market options. Smith made the comments after Coinbase Global listed its shares earlier this week. Coinbase (ticker: COIN), the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., went public Wednesdaywith shares rising 32%. On Friday, the stock rose nearly 6% to $342, valuing Coinbase at $89.36 billion, versus a valuation of $65.3 billion at the reference price for the deal of $250. On Wednesday, Coinbases stock peaked at $429.54, valuing the exchange at $112.2 billion before dropping. The Coinbase IPO was interesting because it showed how the public markets will receive a crypto company, Smith said. Awareness of cryptocurrencies has improved, but not everyone understands them, Smith said. We havent even gotten to that point with the internet yet, he said. Crypto acceptance is better this year, and it is much improved compared with a decade ago, but we probably have a little bit further to go, he said. Blockchain.com is the latest crypto company to consider an IPO. Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange and one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges in the world, is also expected to go public Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is also said to be considering a listing. Founded in 2011, Blockchain.com has raised $500 million in funding since its founding This includes a $300 million round in Marchled by DST Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and VY Capital. The round valued Blockchain.com at $5.2 billion. Blockchain.com is looking to move beyond crypto. It provides a platform for retail and institutional clients to trade crypto while also supplying custody, clearing and settlement services. Smith wants to have foreign-currency exchange, corporate equities, options and other investment products, as well as cryptocurrencies, available on the platform by the end of 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported We just trade crypto.

Consumer spending had lagged, but the latest figures showed a turnaround. Retail sales growth was 6.3% in March when calculated on a two-year average growth basis -- which removes distortions created by last years lockdowns -- up sharply from the rates seen last year.We are seeing a bit more balanced recovery in the Chinese economy, Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS AG, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. That early pickup in construction industry is going to give way to more household consumption, she added. Consumer spending at restaurants and sales of discretionary goods such as jewelry, alcohol and tobacco led the growth of retail sales in March.The economy was also boosted by a jump in investment from overseas. Inbound investment into China rose almost 40% to $45 billion in the first three months of 2021, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce released Thursday. That was the highest for that period in comparable data back to 2002.Markets were choppy following the data release but ended the day little changed, with the benchmark CSI 300 Index paring an earlier loss of as much as 0.6% to finish up 0.35% for the day. The yield on benchmark 10-year sovereign debt fell slightly to 3.16%. The onshore yuan was unchanged on the day at 6.5226 per dollar.Broadening out the recovery remains a work in progress with growth in the first quarter still reliant on the property sector. Fixed-asset investment in real estate rose 7.6% on a two-year average growth basis and infrastructure spending increased roughly in-line with pre-pandemic rates. Quarterly steel production of 271 million tons suggests that annual output is on course to top 1 billion tons for the second year running.What Bloomberg Economics Says...The undershoot in GDP growth relative to expectations and lopsided nature of the recovery do not warrant any economy-wide shift in monetary policy, in our view.Looking forward, production is poised to start peaking, while demand should pick up further. This should add more balance in what looks to be a steady recovery ahead.Chang Shu, chief Asia economistFor full report, click hereAlthough Beijing has promised no sharp turns in monetary and fiscal support this year, some prominent economists have warned that premature tightening could still put the recovery at risk. The central bank has asked banks to curtail loan growth in coming months as it seeks to control credit to curb asset bubbles. Alongside the investment data, data showing home prices grew at the fastest pace in seven months in March will likely prompt more action by Chinese policy makers to rein in the sector.Considering the robust recovery, we certainly do not expect Beijing to step up easing measures, but it is also unlikely to make a sharp shift in its policy stance, Nomura economists led by Lu Ting wrote in a note. Authorities have learned lessons from a forceful deleveraging campaign in 2017-18, which led to bond defaults, a stock market selloff and weaker growth, they said.The statistics bureau said Friday inflation is expected to remain in a moderate range this year, and while rising commodity costs could boost domestic prices, theres no basis for prices in upstream sectors to rise significantly.The economy is far from overheating, said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd. The consumer sector doesnt have a solid basis for overheating, and I dont think the central bank will take a faster turn for monetary policy.Bloomberg Economics forecasts global GDP growth of 6.9% in 2021, rapid enough to bring output substantially back onto its pre-Covid path. Data released Thursday showed the U.S. economys comeback is firing on all cylinders, with retail sales exceeding pre-pandemic levels in all categories except restaurants. Production at U.S. factories increased in March by the most in eight months.China has rapidly accelerated its vaccination campaign over the past month in a move that should help bolster spending on services. A recovery in major economies fueled by vaccine roll-outs and the Biden administrations massive fiscal stimulus is expected to sustain rapid growth in Chinese exports this year.Economists have upgraded their forecasts for Chinas growth in recent days: Bloomberg Economics expects 9.3% expansion, ING Groep NV economist Iris Pang predicts 8.6% and Nomura sees 8.9%.We expect the economy to continue to gain momentum in the second quarter, with a rotation in terms of the drivers of growth compared to last year, said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics Ltd. in Hong Kong. Less generous fiscal and monetary policy will weigh on infrastructure and real estate investment, while improved profitability and confidence should buoy corporate investment and consumption.(Updates with foreign investme",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/07af453c-4d24-3b33-99ba-78d0a976d098/is-coinbase-on-your-wish.html

However,","0 Bitcoin is suddenly all over mainstream media, whetting the appetite of risk-taking investors interested in entering positions in cryptocurrencies However, what they dont understand is all the benefits that this emerging asset class and the underlying blockchain technology have to offer. Negative perceptions about cryptocurrencys use for crime continue to get in the way of widespread acceptance. And even if that barrier is broken, learning about the technology and even using it can be challenging or confusing at first. However, Euler.Tools, the worlds first real-time block explorer platform that intends to disrupt the crypto trading industry using interconnected data, could finally make learning crypto and blockchain easy. Heres how Euler.Tools is helping traders see and understand blockchain technology and market events all from one single platform. The Early Mathematical Origins Behind Euler.Tools The story of how Euler.Tools first began was a struggle. Founder Jorge de los Santos got into crypto trading after finding success in other markets, only to get totally liquidated. His fascination with where the money went from there fueled his passion for learning more about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The more he searched for concrete sources of information, Santos realized that the industry still faced many challenges. As Santos first began his ambitious project, developers were unfamiliar with blockchain, and there were still many misconceptions about the technology itself. Santos was inspired by mathematician Leonhard Euler, who created graph theory and solved The Seven Bridges of Knigsberg problem. Euler.Tools applies an old methodology to modern-day problems to find the most efficient bridges into blockchain understanding and adoption. The Right Tools To Build The Future Of Blockchain Solutions Crypto traders are armed to the teeth with various tools and data sources, including TradingView, DexTools, BitQuery, and much more. But to access all this information, either the trader needs to invest in dozens of monitors or needsa to visit website after website after website to get all the info they need. Education is even more challenging with regard to bringing new users into the space. In addition, what exists today is difficult to understand clearly. Euler.Tools is revolutionizing blockchain data and education with an all-in-one solution, bringing together crucial data feeds to make widespread crypto adoption a reality. Convenience is a significant barrier in cryptocurrencies today. By including everything from tax prep to data visualization tools for fundamental and technical analysis, the technology will finally be accessible enough to grow. How Euler.Tools Revolutionizes Traditional Oracle Solutions Euler.Tools is an oracle that checks every single contract, operation, blockchain, and more, aggregating all information into its innovative data bridge blockchain architecture. The protocol even taps into other Oracle feeds, making it what is dubbed as a MetaOracle. The process itself is fully automated, avoiding delays due to manual intervention and preventing bayesian distortion. The information is also highly detailed. For example, most feeds only consider pricing, while Euler.Tools looks at liquidity, profitability, gas costs, and other vital data critical to decision making. The fully transparent, real-time blockchain explorer can filter data by contract, exchange, base currency, trading pair, and more. You as the user can check volumes, addresses, wallets, minting rates, token burn rates, and just about anything that you could possibly imagine. Wallets can be directly connected to the platform for further data enrichment, putting you in tune even more with your trading portfolio than ever before. From there, you can create set up alerts, monitor token progress, and get notified when new tokens are created, and so much more. Learn More About Bridging The Gap To Adoption With Euler.Tools Euler.Tools also integrates the deflationary EULER token for holders to participate in liquidity mining and receive exclusive incentives and benefits. A buyback mechanism supports long-term growth in the value of the token by reducing the overall circulating supply. Holding EULER tokens gives users access to basic platform functionality. Simultaneously, various subscription tiers are available for those interested in taking advantage of key platform features, such as the DEX Block Explorer, Big Data Query, Portfolio Protection, and the Aggregated Data Trading Interface. Using all of the tools Euler has to offer, novices can become pros in no time at all, while experts now have a one-stop-shop source for all their data needs.

April 14, 2021 | Written by: Categorized: Banking and financial markets| Blockchain explained| Blockchain in financial services Share this post: How can businessesabsorb disruptive impact and begin to integrate these new business models in existing and new streams of business opportunity? NFTs have taken the world by storm. Rejuvenating the blockchainmovement started by Bitcoin, followed by smart contract platform Ethereum, NFTs seem to be a natural progression in the explosion of asset tokenization, of all kinds of things we value. NFT stands for non-fungible token and to understand NFT we need to understand the concept of fungibility! What is an NFT? An asset is considered fungible when it is considered mutually interchangeable with another identical item. For instance, money which can be changed for other forms and modality or other purposes. In the crypto-sphere, most native assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum serve the same function, besides its core purpose or providing utility they are also fungible tokens. By this definition non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, invert the definition of fungibility and provide a unique perspective of other things that are also as valuable to us as money and can be measured in fungible units. See how blockchain adds value to trade and finance NFTs solve the issue of uniqueness and a one-of-a-kind asset type. Examples include not only the popular collectable such as digital art, music, and other digital collectibles  which we value and treasure  but can also include other practical objects such as digital IDs, healthcare records, credit history and others, which are unique, valuable to us, and serve a purpose in digital networks powered by blockchain So, while blockchain is the underlying technology that provides a transaction system by enforcing a digital ledger and enforces rules of engagement via smart contracts it also extended tenets such as immutability, transaction record and transparency to facilitate verification and asset movement with an embedded trust system. What can NFTs be used for? NFTs are also a type of token and asset class online  other tokenized assets can include stable coin, security tokens, tokenized securities and others. NFTs are unique in that they can be tradable (art and collectibles) or hypothecated (healthcare records or digital history) and this is where things get interesting. As NFTs are also things of value and make their way into marketplaces they need a fungible token like a utility coin or stable coin for derivation of value in measurable terms. These marketplaces will usually need integration with either banking rails or existing crypto-provided rails such as digital exchanges or a DeFi ecosystem to facilitate trade and transfer. I address the complex issue of a fleeting and rapid rise of NFTs, after a similar meteoric phased rise of decentralized finance(DeFi), creating amazing innovations with the immense promise of democratization, new business models, and global marketplaces with global access  all fueled by the basic premise of decentralization and fundamental constructs of tokenization and wallets. NFTs may be characterized as unique one-of-a-kind cryptographic tokens with some intrinsic value to the holder (ID, health record) or a market (art, collectible). Where are NFTs going next? NFTs that have an intrinsic value and are essentially tokens that are simple proof-validations of the existence, authenticity, and ownership of digital assets. Fungible tokens are valued on various bases, such as the sum total of economic activity in the network (cryptocurrency), utility (smart contracts and transaction network processing), assigned values (as in stable coins and security tokens), and so on. NFTs represent both transferable entities and non-transferable tokens that we value. We begin to realize the promise of blockchain that envisioned digitization, tokenization and democratization of finance by enabling networks that are capable of moving value with reduced friction and intermediation. The question to ponder now is: how do businesses, individuals and enterprises understand the transformative and disruptive impact and begin to integrate these new business models into existing and new streams of business opportunity?

Another event headliner, MicroStrategy MSTR CEO Michael Saylor, pointed out that the result is mic-drop-worthy: We went from zero adoption in the world to 26% enthusiasm in less than 12 months, he says. But despite the galloping interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from both institutional and retail investors, Schulman said PayPal, is one large company that is unlikely to put bitcoin on its balance sheet this year, citing volatility concerns from investors. On the flipside, Saylor noted on a separate panel that everybody talks about the volatility of bitcoin, but volatility measures the rate at which it's going up in price. It's the same as buying the volatility of Tom Brady. He's got the highest volatility in the Football League, LeBron James has high volatility in the basketball league. The winner of every single sport and the winning team of everything on Earth is always the most volatile by definition because it's the one that's winning most often, added Saylor. Since August 11, 2020, when MicroStrategy revealed its first bitcoin purchase worth $250 million, the software company has bought $2.2 billion in bitcoin, more than any other publicly traded company in the world. Its stock has soared 534.3%over the past 12 months, while bitcoin has gained 817.5% and the S&P 500 has added 49.6% over the same period. Most of the event discussions centered around bitcoin and the ever-rising wave of institutional bitcoin mania, with comments from Fidelity, Northern Trust NTRS , and CME Group CME . Yet alternative cryptocurrencies and blockchains were also mentioned. Visa's head of crypto Cuy Sheffield said the credit card giant ultimately wants to support new types of cryptocurrencies and protocols and find ways to integrate them into Visas core network. Last month, the company started accepting settlement payments from its global cryptocurrency wallet partner Crypto.com in stablecoin USDC on the ethereum blockchain. Beyond cryptocurrencies, executives from Walmart Global Tech, luxury powerhouse LVMH, South Africa-based pulp producer Sappi and partner of Russias leading mining and smelting producer Nornickel, Atomyze, discussed applications of distributed ledger technology in supply chain tracking and fraud prevention. The two-hour event concluded with a panel discussion with DTCC and Vanguards blockchain bosses showing how the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the process of merging the two worlds of enterprise blockchain, which traditionally doesnt use cryptocurrency, with the growing digital asset space. John Evans, head of blockchain strategy at Vanguard, said: With the net effect of everything that occurred in markets between the beginning of the lockdown and maybe the fourth quarter, I think that all of the mindset that needed to shift definitely at all levels of these large financial services organizations finally coalesced.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-12 23:00:00,Where Will Bitcoin and Blockchain Fit in the Banking System in 25 Years? -- The Motley Fool,One of these may have a brighter future than the other.,") Jun 27, 2018 at 10:45AM Will bitcoin truly become the currency of the world? Will blockchain technology be used in our everyday lives? host Michael Douglass and Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel think the answer is ""yes,"" but only to one of these two questions. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on June 25, 2018. Michael Douglass: Let's start with blockchain. I believe that blockchain will be in widespread use for its dispersed ledger capabilities. I will further add, I do not think that Fannie and Freddie will be using blockchain for mortgages because I think they're going to lag the rest of the market. But, I'm betting that, throughout the private sector, blockchain will be used for contracts, and maybe even some non-agency conforming loans might be using blockchain for validation. Matt Frankel: There are a ton of applications for blockchain technology. We're only starting to see this pick up a little bit. One important distinction I want to make -- and we're going to get into this in a little more detail in a minute -- blockchain does not mean Bitcoin. Blockchain does not mean any other cryptocurrency. This is a form of technology. It's just like saying, ""The internet does not mean Microsoft."" It's one thing that came out of internet technology. Blockchain technology, I definitely agree with Michael on this one, is going to grow by leaps and bounds. There are so many applications, not only in finance but in fields like healthcare, for example. There are a ton of applications for blockchain in terms of record-keeping and things like that. I definitely agree with you on that one. Douglass: Here's the one that, I don't think it's going to be too controversial between you and me, Matt, but it might be for some of our listeners -- I do not believe that any of the current major cryptocurrencies will be in widespread use for conducting business transactions. There, I said it! They are too resource-intensive, they're just too slow, and they can't handle the volume. Now, that's not to say that they won't be used as validation. Again, I think blockchain will be. But, I don't think we're going to be regularly paying the pizza delivery guy with Bitcoin. Now, I do believe that new cryptocurrencies will emerge and may, in fact -- and probably will -- better solve the speed and cost difficulties that would plague today's cryptos at scale. But, I do not believe that any of our current -- you might think of them as first or second-generation -- cryptos will be in widespread, common use across society. Frankel: Just to add a little more color to that, when Michael says the major cryptocurrencies, I believe you're referring to, what, the biggest dozen or two dozen that exist right now? Douglass: Yeah, exactly. Frankel: OK. There are 1,900 cryptocurrencies in counting right now. Douglass: [laughs] Right! Frankel: And there are more coming online every day. It's possible that the ones that will eventually have a big impact have already been invented. There's already third-generation cryptocurrencies being invented. But it's way too early to tell. Who knows which one of the 1,900 could eventually become what everyone thinks Bitcoin is going to become? There's no way of knowing right now. Will cryptocurrency still be a thing in the future? Absolutely. It could definitely one day -- probably not in the next 25 years -- completely replace our currency system as we know it. Will it be Bitcoin itself that does it? Probably not. And that's kind of the point there. It is interesting to note, though, that a lot of those 1,900 cryptocurrencies utilize Bitcoin and Ethereum and the other blockchains in their technology. That's an interesting dynamic. But, will Bitcoin itself be as big as everyone thinks it's going to be in 25 years? I'm predicting no.

The company said it mined 75% more Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) tokens than it did last year, and that has the market excit","tokens than it did last year, and that has the market excited. As of 11 a.m. EDT today, Riot Blockchain stock was up 8%. So what According to today's press release, Riot Blockchain mined 491 Bitcoins in the first quarter, with 187 of those coming in March alone. This was a notable increase from last year. First-quarter Bitcoin production was up 75% from the same period in 2020, and production in March was up 80% year over year. Image source: Getty Images. This is particularly noteworthy because it was twice as easy to mine Bitcoin last year, so to speak. Every few years, the Bitcoin network has what's called a ""halving event."" When Bitcoin reaches a halving date, the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half. Miners do the same amount of work, but don't get the same payout. Since May 2020, miners have been getting just 6.25 Bitcoin tokens per block mined. Therefore, Riot Blockchain has increased its computing power enough to not only compensate for the halving event but also take Bitcoin mining share. This can be measured with something called a ""hash rate."" The company ended 2019 with a hash rate of around 100 peta-hashes per second (PH/s) whereas the total hash rate of Bitcoin was around 100 thousand PH/s, according to Blockchain.com. Now, Riot Blockchain's hash rate is expected to reach 1,600 PH/s by the end of this month while the total hash rate of the network is around 172,000 PH/s. From these numbers, it's clear to see Riot Blockchain's growth is outpacing the growth of the network. Mining share is important. The amount of Bitcoin tokens that can be mined is fixed. So Bitcoin miners are paid relative to the amount of hash rate they provide the network. With Riot Blockchain increasing its share, its payouts are also increasing, which is why investors are excited today. Image source: Getty Images. Now what Riot Blockchain isn't settling for its hash rate of 1,600 PH/s, and for good reason. With the price of Bitcoin now over $60,000, many miners are actively buying new mining machines in hopes of getting more of this valuable cryptocurrency Riot intends to have a hash rate of 7,700 PH/s by the end of 2022. This will be a gradual process, but investors can expect timely updates. Also in today's announcement, Riot Blockchain said it intends to update shareholders on its mining progress monthly. 10 stocks we like better than Riot Blockchain, Inc When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What is Blockchain? Blockchain is always associated with Bitcoin, since it is the technology that allows mining and transactions using virtual currency. In other words, Blockchain is what guarantees that a given user owns a certain amount in Bitcoin, as well as what validates the transfer or payment using the virtual currency. But of course, Blockchain goes far beyond Bitcoin. After all, the technology allows data validation in a very efficient and decentralized way, which meant that the technology could be considered as a verification method in several segments. How does Blockchain work? The data in the Blockchain obeys a standard so that they can be verified and validated at any time, causing a chain of information to exist that necessarily needs to be associated with each one of them, in order. This order makes it impossible to cross the data chain, since, for a data to be validated, part of the information is in the previous data and part in the next data. This cascading organization allows greater reliability throughout the system, as it is not possible to insert data randomly into the Blockchain. Therefore, a transaction can only be carried out once, inhibiting duplication and even fraud. Its safe? Lets imagine that we arrived at a location that offers service passwords, so that, these passwords bring in addition to a number that orders the arrival of users, date and time information for removing the password. That is, in a single data it is possible to know when the user arrived, who arrived before and who should be next. Blockchain works in a similar way, so that data can be validated basically in the same way as a password, since each one of them presents information about its origin and cannot be duplicated. As we have seen, it is practically impossible to defraud a movement through Blockchain, which has led financial institutions to consider the validation modality for their movements. In addition, the method allows data verification in a very efficient way, which can be used to validate certificates and even virtual documents and contracts. The technology is not yet used on a large scale outside the cryptocurrency universe, but the tendency is for there to be an expansion of the validation modality, since it is an extremely safe way to guarantee the reliability of information transmitted over the internet, including being an alternative for security of connected devices.

MIAMI (PRWEB) April 11, 2021 Blockchain strategies are to be discussed on an upcoming episode of Viewpoint with Dennis Quaid. The informational television segment will cover the innovative uses for the technology alongside the leading blockchain experts making strides in the industry. Content providers will supply information for the episode, which is to be produced by the creative team behind the Viewpoint program. Blockchain made its debut in 2008 as part of a proposal for Bitcoin, a virtual currency system. It is an open, shared ledger that can efficiently record transactions between two parties in a verifiable and permanent way. Blockchains are commonly used for recording transactions made with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Contracts and transactions, and the records, are part of the core structure of today's economic, political, and legal systems. With blockchain, contracts can be embedded with code and stored in transparent shared databases protected from deletion, revision, and tampering. Every process from signatures, to agreements and payments, could have a digital record and signature that could be validated, stored, shared, and identified. Blockchain can create transparency and protection where it currently is lacking. Viewpoint is proud to share information about the new advances in the digital world that are making futures brighter and will provide additional details about blockchain technology's uses in the latest episode. Dennis Quaid will introduce the segment on Viewpoint. The short-form Viewpoint program is made for audiences with the intent to educate. The show has received multiple Tellys and is created by a tenured crew of creative developers and producers.

Prices and daily changes as of Jan. 26, 2018 at 12:30 p.m. EST; prices are rounded to the nearest cent where appropriate. Ripple (XRP-USD) has been a major laggard recently. The cryptocurrency, which gained notoriety for its partnerships with companies like American Express and MoneyGram International, traded for as much as $1.70 last Friday, and now trades for 28% less. The likely reason for the drop is the news that Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck abruptly halted withdrawals earlier today. Rumors indicate that the exchange was hacked and could have lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies -- particularly NEM, down 6.9% today, and Ripple (XRP-USD). $240 million flows into blockchain ETFs in one week A couple of blockchain-based ETFs launched last week, and to say that investors seem interested is an understatement. Since their launch, about $240 million has flowed into the two new funds. So what is a blockchain ETF? Instead of investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, blockchain ETFs invest in the stocks of companies that have substantial investments in, or involvement with, blockchain technology. Here are a few examples of the holdings of these young ETFs, and why each one is included: Overstock.com: Overstock was one of the first online retailers to accept bitcoin several years ago, and it's actively involved in the blockchain industry. The company has an entire division focused on blockchain projects, and it recently announced a partnership with Siebert Financial to offer low-cost brokerage services, which may include cryptocurrency trading. IBM: IBM has several blockchain projects, including a partnership with Stellar to develop a real-time payments system. Square: Payment-processing company Square recently began experimenting with bitcoin purchases in its Square Cash app. Notice that stocks like the Bitcoin Investment Trust and Riot Blockchain are not included. The new ETFs are not aiming to invest in cryptocurrencies themselves or ; nor are they speculating on unproven companiesthat have the word ""blockchain"" in their names. Rather, these ETFs are intended as investments focusing on established companies that could benefit from advances in blockchain technology.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-11 00:00:00,Bitcoin Investing: These 2 Companies Are Investing Millions in Blockchain,"While trashing cybercurrencies, big business is investing huge sums into the underlying technology.",". A report from CB Insightsshows just how active corporations are in the space. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet has invested millions in the technology, but very little in cryptocurrencies CB Insights notes that corporations have made more than 140 equity investments in blockchain since 2012 with a total investment of $1.2 billion. As of the time of the report, 42 corporate deals had taken been inked. Except for Japanese company SBI Holdings, CB Insights lists Alphabet as the largest corporate blockchain investor with six investments through its Google Ventures arm. Alphabet is more concerned with blockchain than currencies. The company's most notable blockchain investment, Ripple, uses the technology to settle international bank transactions. The company claims it can do so with a one-third reduction in operating costs and allow lenders to move money in seconds. However, since its biggest clients are banks, it's unlikely that cryptocurrencies are the trading currency, but rather blockchain is the technology to help banks transact in fiat currencies. Other investments are in a similar vein to Ripple: Ledger X, the first regulated institutional trading platform, Veem, the online payment provider that uses blockchain to settle international transactions, and Storj, a blockchain-based cloud storage service. Overstock is a rare ""all-of-the-above"" investment Outside of investing in cryptocurrencies, perhaps the best way to invest in the cyber currency craze is Overstock. CEO Patrick Byrne is the most outspoken supporter of bitcoin among major CEOs, noting ""bitcoin is more powerful than physical money."" Additionally, the company was among the first retailers that transacted in bitcoin More recently, Overstock is creating more of a buzz with its blockchain forays than its online retail operations. Under its Medici Ventures unit, the company has a portfolio of 12 different companies. (This differs from CB Insights count of six investments in total, but the difference appears to be that some of Medici's companies were internally developed.) The most recognized company in Medici Ventures' portfolio is the blockchain-based cybercurrency trading platform, tZERO. This month, Overstock went even further in its cybercurrency plans by launching a $250 million ICO for tokens for the tZERO that would function as preferred equity in the trading site. A small piece of the pie It's a folly to invest in the companies above to take advantage of the cryptocurrency craze. For Alphabet, 99% of its revenue comes from its Google unit, which is search and ad-related revenue. The other 1%, what Google affectionately calls Other Bets, houses many different businesses in addition to Google Ventures. Additionally, under new CFO Ruth Porat the company has been slowing spending in its Other Bets segment to improve its bottom line. Even though Byrne wants to sell Overstock's retail business to become a true blockchain-focused company, this has not occurred and it will likely be difficult to secure approval from a shareholder majority that invested in an online retailer. In the end, if you've carefully weighed the risks of this new asset class and still want exposure, there are better ways to do so than investing in these two companies.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-10 10:48:42,The Right (and Wrong) Way to Invest in Blockchains,Bitcoin investors have ridden a volatility roller coaster for the past two years. Here's a much better long-term strategy for investing in blockchains and cryptocurrencies.,"Aug 8, 2018 at 7:11AM Author Bio I am a believer in the power of disruptive innovation, and that individual investors can significantly outperform the market over long periods of time. I am the lead advisor of our Motley Fool Explorer service, where we look for future-focused companies well-poised to capitalize on developing long-term trends. Follow @@TMFInnovator What a ride it's been for blockchain investors. We've almost become numb to get-rich-quick blockchain schemes, as scores have surfaced during the past two years. It seems like everyone and their dog has devised an idea on how to make money off of blockchains Let's take a quick walk down bitcoin memory lane. The genesis of the fast-money ideas began as soon as cryptocurrencies were offered directly to the public. There was no need to be an accredited investor or to work with financial middlemen. Exchanges such as Coinbase and Circle gave individuals with no previous investing experience a way to purchase bitcoin before most people even knew what it was. Speculation ran rampant. ""Bitcoin"" became a headline that everyone wanted to read, and its price soared from $1,000 to $20,000 in 2017. Nearly 1,000 other cryptocurrencies became available to the public through Initial Coin Offerings. The rampant speculation attracted institutions like blood attracts sharks. Investment products such as Grayscale's Bitcoin Investment Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) could be bought or sold through more traditional stock brokers like Fidelity. This gave investors a way to speculate on bitcoin's price without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Things then just started getting weird. Long Island Iced Tea formally changed its nameto Long Blockchain (NASDAQ: LBCC) and its shares immediately tripled in value. Bitconnect came up with a progressive referral program to boost the value of its tokens. No one cared that actions like these weren't actually creating any value. Suddenly, everyone started rethinking their blind optimism. Long Blockchain's shares fell 95% in six months, and Bitconnect closed its doors after being exposedas a Ponzi scheme. If ""euphoria"" described the public's attitude toward blockchains in 2017, then ""trepidation"" seems to be the word for 2018. This volatility roller coaster has investors hesitant, but still eagerly waiting to see what happens next. So is there any hope for bitcoin's future? Image source: Getty Images. Peering into the blockchain crystal ball To answer that question, we should recognize that the activities described above refer to the general public's interaction with bitcoin. Things happened quickly, there was massive speculation, and most people had no idea how or where bitcoin could actually be used. But the enterprise is a completely different animal. Moving much more deliberately, large corporations actually have an interest in blockchains as a way to improve their operations. And improving operations could translate to increasing profits for shareholders. I recently spoke with CB Insights' intelligence analyst Arieh Levi at the Future of Fintech event Levi said that enterprises take a different view of blockchains than the general public: It's important to separate and understand the difference between two types of blockchain companies. The first is the crop of companies that sprouted up in 2015 and 2016 that are looking to use blockchain technology in the enterprise as corporate infrastructure to help with back-office processes. And those have seen slow growth -- a lot of local funding in those years, but certainly the growth there has slowed. Then, of course, there's the ICO mania and ICO craze. These are companies trying to build a new, decentralized web. And to a large degree, that thesis has seen lots of money -- they raised $18 billion [cumulative] during the past year, which is more than most other sectors combined, which is insane. At the same time, that sector, that area of blockchain research is softening and moving sideways with the price action. I think we can expect some more of that in the future as some of the worse projects there get flushed out. There could be a lot of promise in those slow-growth",https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/08/the-right-and-wrong-way-to-invest-in-blockchains.aspx

Just like the stock market, the cryptocurrency market is frequently subjected to extreme price fluctuations  both upwards and downwards. Tesla recently purchasing $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin is just one example of how the crypto market can change. For instance, at the end of 2013 to the beginning of 2014, during the middle of 2017 to the middle of 2018, and now again as weve seen in the past few months, there have been many highs and lows of cryptocurrencies. If we analyze the movement of cryptocurrencies across a 52-week period, its clear that the biggest market capitalization is what weve seen in the past few weeks: Bitcoin (No.1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization) has a 52-week low of US$4106 and a 52-week high of US$58,330 (which are a factor of 14.2 apart) Ethereum (No.2 by market capitalization) has a 52-week low of US$95 and a 52-week high of US$2036 (factor of 21.4 apart) Cardano (No.3 by market capitalization) has a 52-week low of US$0.01913 and a 52-week high of US$1.48 (factor of 77.4 apart) (Data source: https://coinmarketcap.com accessed on March 2, 2021.) This level of fluctuation within a one-year period is seldom seen in the stock market, and its generally not something thats happening once-off to one specific cryptocurrency; its happening often, and to several cryptocurrencies. Understanding the blockchain ecosystem Over the past few years, blockchain technology has swiftly advanced as more companies, researchers and developers begin to adopt and understand it. In the first generation of blockchain platforms, there were many limitations to scalability, the high consumption of energy, limited support of smart contracts, and so on. Now, hundreds of projects and platforms are trying to improve different aspects of blockchain technology, involving hundreds of highly qualified researchers and thousands of skillful engineers. Leading global institutions believe blockchain solutions can have a huge economic impact. However, the realization of this potential will depend on factors such as the technological advances, the acceptance of blockchain solutions by the industry and the general population, the legislation passed to regulate the blockchain space, and the development of new business models based on the technology. Linking back to the crypto market Theres a possibility the recent cryptocurrency price hikes are partially or totally justified by changes in the market participants perception of the factors affecting the future prospects of blockchain platforms. However, in the long run, the value of the cryptocurrencies will depend on the financial added value generated by the blockchain ecosystem. If we look back to the 1990s and the dot-com boom, there was a huge growth in internet use, and it was recognized it would change the world. Hundreds of net-related companies appeared and began developing technologies, services, and applications. A market bubble eventuated due to excessive speculation, and in the crash, numerous companies were forced to shut down. But the internet, of course, turned out to indeed be revolutionary, and some of the companies formed at that time are today among the worlds biggest. If blockchain technologys potential is realized, perhaps many of the current blockchain platforms and projects wont make the cut, drastically reducing in value or vanishing altogether. But, theres a reasonable chance that some of them will be big winners.",https://scitechdaily.com/whats-the-buzz-about-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-technology/

Exchange lightly edited. This week we spoke to Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, a crypto lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C. What's the biggest item on the agenda in Washington this year? Anti-money laundering policy is probably the biggest one we're worried about. Done incorrectly, that could have major effects on the growth of the industry. Securities laws are another issue that always seem to flare up with different enforcement actions. But, you know, there's also some sort of lesser tax policy issues. There is policy related to stablecoins. There are privacy issues. And those are very important in and of themselves, but relative to the anti-money laundering stuff and securities stuff, they have to take a little bit of a backseat, because they're a little bit less of an existential threat. Are U.S. admins learning more about crypto as we go? Yes, and I think that tracks with overall understanding by the general public, and also the growth and expansion of new types of crypto networks and the growth in Americans that hold crypto assets, right? From the industry's perspective, the whole point is to replace centralized organizations with decentralized software protocols ... Just that basic understanding of what crypto actually does, that it's more than just this kind of digital-asset that you sell, and trade, but it's actually these networks that perform really complex services  I think that is still lost on those people. Kristin Smith Has Congress warmed to digital-assets yet? It's still a challenge, particularly for Congress, because they're spread so thin. There's definitely a small set of energized members that are into crypto. They tend to be more on the Republican side than the Democratic side. But we have a few Democrats that are starting to get interested. Do you expect regulation efforts to pick up as the market expands? We're going to have a little bit of time. I don't think they're going to come running out of the gate. Back in 2017, when all of the initial coin offerings (ICOs) were going on, that was a problem, right, because the consumers were being harmed. So, if crypto can stay on good behavior, so to speak, and build things in a responsible way, I think well have time.

Bitcoin has also made its way into the corporate treasuries of Tesla Inc, Square and MicroStrategy Inc.  While central banks remain skeptical of digital currencies, analysts say more real world uses of bitcoin will increase its appeal as a long-term store of value. 1d ago Arm Battle With China CEO Escalates, Complicating SoftBank Sale (Bloomberg) -- The battle for control of Arm Ltd.s China business is escalating with new lawsuits aimed at keeping the units controversial chief executive in power, further complicating SoftBank Group Corp.s efforts to sell the business to Nvidia Corp.The dispute erupted almost a year ago in June after the board voted to oust Arm China Chief Executive Officer Allen Wu for conflicts of interest, but he refused to leave. Now the Chinese unit, which remains under Wus control, has filed lawsuits against three senior executives the board designated to replace him, according to people familiar with the matter. The previously unreported suits could take years to resolve, suggesting Wu may remain entrenched.Wu fired the three men -- including co-CEO Phil Tang -- but they were subsequently reinstated by the board. In the new lawsuits, Arm China is suing the trio, demanding they return company property, according to the people.Arm China declined to comment on any ongoing legal cases or possible settlement talks. It did say the three executives had caused material damages to the company and they had been terminated for legitimate reasons.Tang didnt return requests for comment. Arm Ltd. declined to elaborate, saying it wont comment on pending legal matters.The complex tussle has thrown into question the future of Arm, whose semiconductor technology is the worlds most widely used for smartphones and is increasingly deployed in computers. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son agreed to sell the British chip designer to Nvidia for $40 billion last year, but the path for completing that transaction is growing increasingly difficult.The China dispute also raises questions about Beijings willingness to protect foreign investment in the worlds second-largest economy. Arm Ltd. sold a majority stake in the China unit to a consortium of investors, including Beijing-backed institutions. That has complicated the British firms efforts to manage Arm China and Wu, who has support from local authorities in Shenzhen.Both sides appear to be at a stalemate. Wu, a Chinese-born U.S. citizen, pulled back from signing settlement agreements worth tens of millions of dollars if he would leave the company, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about legal matters. At the same time, two minority shareholders in Arm China linked to Wu have filed lawsuits to overturn his June 4 dismissal, they said.SoftBank opened negotiations with him last year and had hoped to reach some sort of resolution, they said. Instead the court battles are deepening and the Japanese company has soured over the increasingly complicated dispute, the people said.

Chinese companies need unfettered access to Arms products to push forward with the countrys attempts to make itself more independent in chip technology, an area where its largely reliant on imports. Beyond resolving the stalemate, Nvidia and SoftBank also need Beijings signoff to seal their deal, and its unclear whether Wus presence would complicate that.Wus hold on Arm China is partially due to local laws which make it difficult to change control of a company unless youre physically in control of the company stamp and registration documents.

Bloomberg Russian Tycoon Komarov Eyes Precious Metals After Pipes Sale (Bloomberg) -- Russian tycoon Andrey Komarov is setting his sights on precious metals mining after selling ChelPipe PJSC, the pipe maker that made him a billionaire.Komarov is talks to purchase the Kumroch gold deposit in Russias Far East from Zoloto Kamchatki, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as its private. Hes also interested in investing in the Fedorova Tundra platinum and palladium project in the Murmansk region, the head of the company that owns the deposit said in March.While demand for steel pipes fell during the coronavirus crisis, platinum-group metals prices rallied on supply disruptions and stricter emissions rules that boost usage in autocatalysts. Even though gold has been pressured in recent months on bets for a economic recovery, prices are still historically high amid ultra-loose monetary policies around the world.A spokeswoman for Komarov said hes considering investing in the Fedorova Tundra deposit in the future and that hes interested in mining projects in general, without elaborating. Zoloto Kamchatkis press service declined to comment.Until last year, Zoloto Kamchatki was controlled by billionaire Viktor Vekselbergs Renova, which sold it to Complexprom, a company owned by former Renova managers, a spokesman for Renova said, without elaborating.Komarov, 54, bought his first stake in ChelPipe in the late 1990s, and saw his wealth soar after rebuilding the companys facilities, impressing the Kremlin. When visiting a new site in Chelyabinsk in 2010, President Vladimir Putin said the modern layout made it look more like Disneyland than a pipe workshop.In March, Komarov sold his 86.5% stake in ChelPipe to rival TMK PJSC for 84 billion rubles ($1.1 billion). The tycoons fortune now stands at about $1.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The Kumroch deposit holds 34.4 tons (1.1 million ounces) of gold reserves, a Zoloto Kamchatki representative said. It is due to start mining in 2025, with expected annual output of as much as 5 tons.Komarovs Atom Gold has already filed documents to the anti-monopoly service to approve the purchase of 75% and one share of the company that holds the Kumroch license, the people said. The rest would be held by Zoloto Kamchatki, with the partnership sharing the risks of a big project, they said.The Fedorova Tundra deposit is expected to produce as much as 250,000 tons of concentrate annually, mostly containing PGMs, but also nickel, copper and gold.

Understanding blockchain's logistics applications Last year, Walmart food safety chief Frank Yiannas demonstrated that the condition and origin of any food product across the retailer's network could be tracked in two seconds via blockchain -- a process which would have taken nearly a week with older tracking methods. That's why it's smart for JD to use blockchain tracing on food sold on its marketplace. China has been plagued with food safety issues, and the implementation of blockchain-tracked food gives customers a higher level of assurance, which complements JD's corporate mantra of ""authentic products, delivered today."" Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, corporate invoices (known as ""fapiao"" in Chinese) are tightly regulated in China, where they're issued for all financial transactions to discourage tax fraud. Keeping track of all corporate invoices can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, so digitizing all those invoices on a blockchain network where transactions can be quickly tracked could save companies like China Pacific Insurance lots of time and money. But JD's already late to the party JD's blockchain platform sounds revolutionary, but plenty of other companies have already entered the blockchain-as-a-service market. Tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon all offer blockchain-as-a-servicesolutions as extensions of their cloud businesses. In China, Baidu launched a blockchain-as-a-serviceplatform in January. Alibaba already uses blockchain to track purchases, and its fintech affiliate Ant Financial uses blockchain to let Alipay users track charitable donations. Alibaba and Ant Financial also hold the highest number of blockchain-related patents in the entire world. Tencent launched a blockchain-as-a-service platform last year, applied that technology to its fintech transactions and logistics, and even used it to help consumers track medical prescriptions. JD could struggle to grow its blockchain platform against these rivals because it lacks a major cloud infrastructure platform. It could eventually expand the service, but that could be a costly effort for a company that is already struggling with high expenses. JD's tech and content expenses surged 80% annually last quarter, and contributed heavily to its net loss It's not a game changer Blockchain-related news attracts plenty of attention these days, but few of these projects will actually move the needle for their companies. JD's investments in blockchain should improve quality control standards in its own marketplace -- which could boost customer loyalty and widen its moat against Alibaba. However, the blockchain platform probably won't become a meaningful source of revenue because there are simply too many competitors in the market, and unlike JD, those competitors can bundle their blockchain solutions with other cloud services.

nasdaq,NotProvided,2021-04-08 13:01:11,Solving the Challenges of Private Blockchain Transactions,"Transaction privacy is a problem thats existed for almost as long as Bitcoin has been around, despite many wrong assumptions in the early days that blockchain offered anonymity","Apr 9, 2021 2:25PM EDT By Huang Lin Transaction privacy is a problem thats existed for almost as long as Bitcoin has been around, despite many wrong assumptions in the early days that blockchain offered anonymity. However, the reality is that even in the Bitcoin white paper , Satoshi Nakamoto acknowledged the public nature of blockchain transactions. The knowledge of which Bitcoin addresses belong to Satoshi is generally accepted public wisdom among the blockchain community. As soon as Bitcoins lack of privacy became apparent, developers have been working with varying degrees of success to find solutions. In general, the aim is to allow users to transact with at least the same degree of relative privacy they enjoy with their fiat bank accounts while preserving trustlessness. The most widely-used privacy technology is the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, also known as zk-SNARKs or zero-knowledge proofs. They allow one party to prove a statement regarding certain information without actually revealing the information itself, using a secret key thats generated before the transaction happens. An Imperfect Solution Several projects now use zk-SNARKS, including Zcash, Monero, Grin, and Tornado Cash. However, like so many implementations in blockchain, developers have made trade-offs comparable to the famous scalability versus decentralization debate. With zk-SNARKs, the compromise is between scalability and the security of the privacy solution. Zcash, which is a privacy coin, and Tornado Cash, a private transaction protocol, both opted for an implementation that compromises on security while preserving scalability. Their zk-SNARKs require that the secret key used for the transaction is generated using a trusted setup. Essentially, this means that a party has to be trusted with the secret keys that could enable them to launch a double-spend attack. Without undermining the popularity of both projects, the solution flies in the face of blockchains strive for trustlessness and security against double-spend attacks. The other option is the zero-knowledge proof scheme without the need for a trusted setup, but in a way that makes the proof size so large as to cause blockchain bloat. Monero and Grin both opted for this side of the trade-off, meaning that their privacy solutions create a sub-optimal user experience while offering a better guarantee of security. Like the other famous blockchain debate, iterations on the same problem eventually lead to a solution. Now in 2020, projects are starting to emerge that have solved the trade-off, offering anonymous payment protocols for smart contract platforms using an innovation called zk-ConSNARKs. This provides a near-constant proof size while removing the requirement for a trustless setup and thus the security risk of a double-spend attack. Misaligned Incentives The idea of introducing mining or liquidity incentives has spurred the DeFi revolution, and privacy-preserving protocols are no exception to this rule. Projects such as Tornado Cash, and more recently, Lightening Cash have introduced token-based rewards to users of their protocols as a means of increasing adoption. However, not all incentives are created equally. Tornado Cash has been highly successful at achieving a large total value locked, around $1 billion at the time of writing. Its done this by offering rewards linked to transaction values. Therefore, the average value of a deposit is above $23,000 at the time of writing. This situation comes with two issues. Firstly, it speaks to a problem thats becoming endemic in DeFi as a whole. The high transaction fees on Ethereum are pricing everyday cryptocurrency users out of the market. DeFi, which positions itself as open finance, is closed to those who dont have thousands to spend in a single transaction. The second issue is that an incentive model like the one used by Tornado Cash, which is based on the value of transactions or the total value locked, is targeted towards those who have thousands to invest. This means that it serves to limit the value of the privacy-preserving protocol itself. Hide in Plain Sight Consider it this way. If youre in a city and you want to hide, are you more likely to get identified on a relatively quiet street with only a few other people to cloak your presence? Or would it make more sense to disappear into a crowd of tourists on the busiest square in town? A model that incentivizes based on value is attracting high-value transactions from high-net-worth individuals, who number fewer than those who have lower values to invest. Furthermore, theres bound to be more interest in who is behind high-value transactions. A privacy protocol with a high volume of transactions offers more opportunities to hide. Therefore, it makes sense to align the incentives accordingly. Provide people with rewards exclusively for the number of transactions they put through a privacy protocol, rather than the value of their funds. In doing so, you have the blockchain equivalent of a city square crowded with tourists  a privacy protocol that can attract users in sufficiently high volumes to create a critical mass, incentivized by the promise of privacy mining rewards. Furthermore, basing it on a low-fee platform such as the Binance Smart Chain makes it more attractive to the masses who are likely to be deterred by Ethereums high fees. In an industry striving to deliver open finance, privacy shouldnt be something that users are forced to compromise. By providing incentive models aligned to attracting more users and removing security gaps, privacy can be democratized for all participants benefit. Author Bio: Suterusu project.

Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, said on CoinDesk TVs First Mover show that relatively little ether (ETH) was bought at prices above $1,850 and even less was bought at $2,000 or above. The reason why this is important is because the price that people are willing to buy and hold at tells us the level of demand that there is at that price level, Gradwell said. So not a huge amount of demand at that $2,000 price. As of April 5, blockchain data showed there was significant ether accumulation at prices around $1,800, Gradwell wrote this week in a newsletter. That price level is likely to provide strong support because the cost of acquisition indicates historical demand for a cryptocurrency at different price levels. The analysis assumes that the buyers are unlikely to sell their crypto asset at prices below their cost of acquisition. Only about 700,000 ETH were acquired at or above $1,850, costing around $1.4 billion on April 5, three days after ether logged a new all-time high price, Gradwell wrote. By contrast, on March 29  two weeks after bitcoins price peaked  238,000 BTC costing about $14 billion were acquired at or above $57,000. The latest all-time high [ether] price of $2,151 was some way above a large level of support, and suggests that the peak was driven by a relatively small amount of demand, Gradwell wrote. This is in contrast to bitcoin, which had greater prior demand across high price levels. The chart below, from Gradwells newsletter on April 1, also shows that 0.1 million bitcoin were acquired at prices higher than the spot price on March 29: The exercise highlights the limits of using blockchain data to analyze market movements: While the data can offer extra transparency, helping investors and traders understand where cryptocurrency is moving on the networks,the data can also be misleading, relying on humans for the interpretation as well as assumptions about investor psychology. . Gradwell said on CoinDesk TV that his analysis included some potential downward biases, which could skew ethers supporting price level on the lower end. The analysis didnt capture the prices of sales and trades made on centralized exchanges. But Gradwell argued that with the increased shift of ether trading to decentralized finance (DeFi), which is trackable on the blockchain, he is not worried about such downward bias. At the same time, Gradwells analysis also flattens the cost curve of entities that acquired ether at different prices, which may skew the supporting price level lower. Large entities, such as DeFi contracts, tend to hold lots of ETH acquired at both low and high costs, he wrote in the newsletter. For example, 7.4 million ETH with an average cost of acquisition of $1,818 is held in the wrapped ether contracts. On the upward bias side, CoinDesks Lawrence Lewitinn said on the CoinDesk TV show that Gradwells analysis is based on an assumption that people would not sell their ether at a loss. If ether holders are willing to sell their ether at a loss, it means that the $1,800 supporting level may be less strong than expected. Gradwell said a majority of investors who bought ether at its peak price in 2018 sold their ether at a loss, while more bitcoin holders at the time continued to hold their bitcoin throughout the bear market. The persistence of a small, but very bullish, cohort of ether buyers supports my concern that the highest ether prices tend to have a narrow base of support, at least compared to bitcoin, Gradwell wrote.",https://www.coindesk.com/ether-support-bitcoin-blockchain

The Pandemic Highlights Blockchain's Potential Role in Increasing Resilience of Business Communities & Ecosystems. The Market to Reach US$ 30.7 Billion. The global market for Blockchain Technology is projected to reach US$ 30.7 billion by the year 2027, trailing a post COVID-19 CAGR of 43% over the analysis period 2020 through 2027. At a time when the global economic climate is spinning out of control, the blockchain technology market is expected to face severe short-term challenges in the year 2020. This year is expected to end on a dismal note as the pandemic continues to rage through the globe flaring up in second and third waves of infections, each worse than the previous wave, continuing to cause large scale human and financial destruction in countries across the world. Pessimism remains high among chief information officers (CIOs). The continued decline in business confidence is an indication of the gradually worsening economic climate, since business confidence is a well-known leading indicator of future output. Business confidence, in other words, is a barometer of investment growth. As companies revisit their Investment spending plans, its little surprise that IT budgets are being slashed. IT budgets which in the pre-pandemic period was projected to grow by over 5.5% to 6.8% supported largely by enterprise software spending is now set for sharp downward revisions. This downward revision comes despite the fact that the pandemic has set into motion a digital transformation wave. While emerging technologies like AI, IoT, automation, big data, and blockchain will benefit in the post COVID-19 period as essential technologies to have to ensure resilience to future disruptions, they currently come under the non-essential bracket especially for companies struggling to survive and remain afloat. Virtually every technology company is facing financial challenges of disrupted supply chains, business opportunities and low consumer demand for goods and services. Inability to meet quarterly revenue targets mean reduced available funds for planned IT projects. Over 45% to 55% of CIOs expect negative impact on IT budgets in the range of -10% to -40% as compared to the less than 20% who expect spending to actually increase. Excluding automation, cloud computing and technologies for remote working which are high priority as businesses come under pressure to enable WFM and remote operation to ensure business continuity, all other IT spending are being slashed. Blockchain technology will witness decline in all application areas, industrial and non-industrial sectors. While blockchain is witnessing dwindling investments, these glitches are likely to be transitory and the technology is anticipated to spring back relatively quickly than other legacy options. The technology is estimated to witness the highest level of spending over the coming years owing to its intriguing characteristics like redundancy, decentralization and transparency. These aspects are bound to push blockchain adoption across a diverse spectrum of domains, from financial services and healthcare to supply chains. The technology is expected to experience increasing interest and spending across various applications and industry verticals for addressing concerns associated with traditional options, enabling companies to gain an edge over competitors. The technology has become an integral part of business-to-business and business-to-consumer commerce, products and legal processes. Blockchain holds significant potential for prescription management, medical data, online shopping and other areas. The technology is likely to help companies in controlling supply chains, achieving traceability of products and maintaining auditable record of goods movement. Blockchain is anticipated to present new opportunities for participants to manage supply chains, track insurance records and verify medical data. Despite certain degree of reluctance, the technology is poised to find increasing acceptance across manufacturing and professional services companies in the post-pandemic era. The technology is estimated to receive a notable investment of $14.4 billion globally by 2023. The manufacturing & resources sector is estimated to register the fastest growth of 60.5% in terms of blockchain spend, followed by the distribution & services sector, which is forecast to post a solid CAGR of around 58.7%. Despite modest level of risks across majority of industries, blockchain-related deployments are slated to increase in the professional services, healthcare, manufacturing and retail industries owing to the requirement for coordination through the value chain. Regionally, the US is anticipated to remain at forefront of blockchain spending. Following slowdown, blockchain spend in majority of regions is likely to increase notably over 2018-2023, with Central and Eastern Europe & Western Europe leading from the front with a CAGR of more than 63%. Asia-Pacific is estimated to contribute nearly 19.3% of the total spending on blockchain technology in 2020. The regional market is expected to be fueled by increasing investments in the BFSI sector. The technology is anticipated to receive a major stimulus from increasing focus of various countries in Asia-Pacific to improve existing payment techniques and maintain records associated with regulatory compliance.

Further, Square peers Paypal and Mastercard have been taking initiatives to embrace the digital currency. Further, the worlds largest institutional holder of the digital currency - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust - plans to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Additionally, Coinbase Global, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is set to trade publicly through direct listing on Apr 14. Both these developments are expected to boost bitcoins attractiveness among investors. Of late, banking giants J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs have shown interest in dealing with bitcoin. Markedly, bitcoin faces significant regulatory pressure around the world. Central banks have been reluctant to approve bitcoins legitimacy, primarily due to its volatility, which has hindered cryptos potential to gain mass adoption. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission has so far declined to approve a bitcoin ETF due to volatility and lack of price transparency. Banks, among financial institutions, generally face significant regulatory scrutiny because of their role in the economy. This has been a major reason behind their reluctancy in accepting bitcoin. In fact, during 2017 rally, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a fraud, and worse than tulip bulbs, referring to the Dutch tulip bubble burst in the 1600s. Hence, likely change in stance by banking majors bodes well for bitcoins future in the long haul. In fact, the pandemic has raised the need for an alternative currency. Bitcoin has been benefiting from solid adoption by millennials and Gen X, who are looking to hedge against coronavirus-induced weakness in traditional currencies, including U.S. dollar as well as inflation.

investorplace,NotProvided,2021-04-07 13:00:01,How Cardano Makes Decentralization and Blockchain Easily Accessible,Cardano has risen dramatically of late. Part of the reason is that the company is building something that non-blockchain experts comprehend.,") is built upon the idea of decentralization. This is a core tenet of blockchain. Decentralization is central to the idea of blockchain technology, and central to the argument for why people should care about blockchain, and thus Cardano. Source: Shutterstock Cardano has just managed to decentralize one of three important elements of its ecosystem. Lets look at why thats important, and talk about the remaining elements to be decentralized. Decentralization at Cardano One of the underlying arguments in favor of blockchain technology is that decentralization is achievable. Indeed, decentralization leads to power by the people, and ostensibly for the people. The same argument in favor of decentralization applies to Bitcoin BTC-USD ). Yet, there is a big difference between the degree of centralization between Cardano and Bitcoin in their block production. Cardano relies on stake pool operators to control block production on its network. The important news here is that Cardanos 2200 stake pool operators are fully decentralized. In and of itself, this news is fairly difficult to work with. Because blockchain technology and terminology remains so nascent, this kind of news is difficult to comprehend. Fortunately, we can make a pretty good comparison with Bitcoin. 85% of Bitcoin block production is done by the networks 10 most influential pools. Unfortunately this leads to a situation in which smaller stakes often have no choice but to lend their computing power to the large pools. The large pools have a greater chance to solve an algorithm with their greater computing power. And pools which solve a given algorithm are rewarded, so smaller contributors to a Bitcoin pool have an incentive to do as those pools dictate. So there is a fairly logical argument here that Bitcoins goal of decentralization may be anything but. Cardanos 2200 stake pool operators who control 100% of block production are far less likely to rebel or collude than Bitcoins 10 pools that cover 85% of its block production. Such a situation is referred to as a 51% attack. Governance One reason Cardano has gained such an ardent base of supporters is the roadmapthat it has laid out. The roadmap lays out phases of Cardanos development and central goals for each phase. Cardanos roadmap is currently in phase 5 called Voltaire, the French philosopher. The current phase of Cardanos development focuses on decentralization of its governance. Cardano is building a voting and treasury system. Participants can purchase stake  ADA coins  and that stake and voting rights can be used for influence. The treasury system will fund the future development of the Cardano network once fully implemented. In order to fund the treasury, a percentage of all transaction fees will be pooled and appropriated as voted upon. This form of governance will theoretically improve upon what is present across multiple current systems due to its decentralized nature. Cardano expects that IOHK will no longer be in control once its voting and treasury systems are in place. At that time, control should shift entirely to the ecosystem participants themselves. Network Cardanos network becomes fully decentralized once the voting and treasury systems are fully implemented. Whats interesting is that Cardano has spelled out this process and its importance to its network. It appears much more thought out and openly expressed than many other blockchain projects. These kinds of ideas and discussions about governance are usually the domain of developers alone. However, I think this is very welcome by people who are on the fence about cryptos, defi, and blockchain technology. What Cardano is doing is important for mainstream acceptance of the space. Verdict I am a fan of Cardano. I honestly believe that more of the 10,000-foot view is whats needed in blockchain and defi. At least from the marketing and PR side. I also think Cardano is one of the few projects that is actively trying to define what its ecosystem really is. It makes sense to establish a position now.

The Daily Beast Ex-Trump Official Was Finally Punished Under the Hatch Act. Whos Next? Drew AngererFor years, flagrant violations of the Hatch Act were rivaled only by Infrastructure Week as the grimmest running joke of the Trump administration. But nearly three months after President Donald Trump left office, a former administration official has been formally disciplined for exploiting their position for political purposesand more could be on the way.Lynne Patton, a longtime Trump Organization fixture and former event planner, ran afoul of the Hatch Act on multiple occasions during her tenure as public liaison director for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but openly dismissed any chance of facing discipline for violating the law.Just retweeted this amazing tweet from both of my Twitter accountsprofessional and personal, Patton wrote in a 2019 Facebook post after sharing a meme from a conservative account. It may be a Hatch Act violation. It may not be. Either way, I honestly dont care anymore.On Tuesday, however, Patton was finally disciplined for violating the ethics law, accepting a settlement from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel that included a $1,000 fine and a four-year ban from serving in the federal government. Patton was also required to admit that she had knowingly violated the law when she recruited residents of public housing to appear in a video championing Trump at the Republican National Convention last year.Normally, such violations were shrugged off by Trump officials as bureaucratic oopsies. But with the election of President Joe Biden, the Office of Special Counsel and the Merit Systems Protection Boardthe government agency tasked with adjudicating cases of potential Hatch Act violations, which sat without a board quorum for the entirety of Trumps time in officeare beginning to chip at the vast backlog of complaints from the Trump era.Ex-Trump Official Lynne Patton Violated Hatch Act With Deceptive RNC Vids: OSCThe Office of Special Counsel would not confirm the existence of pending investigations, but said that it is slightly constrained by the timing of complaints that were filed with the Merit Systems Protection Board.In order for OSC to file a complaint with the Merit Systems Protection Board, OSC would have had to file the complaint while the subject was still a federal employee, Zachary Kurz, a spokesperson for the Office of Special Counsel, told The Daily Beast. Otherwise MSPB no longer has jurisdiction.But the enormous number of extant complaints submitted to the boardwhich now number in the thousandsmean that some Trumpworld figures are nervous that they may actually face consequences for violating the Hatch Act.Let me put it this way: people are going to wish theyd never tweeted, texted one person close to the White House.Even in an administration marked by a callous disregard for ethics laws, Lynne Patton stood out, Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), the ethics watchdog organization that initially filed the complaint against Patton. What made her behavior particularly egregious was that she not only used her position for political purposes, she misled and exploited public housing residents for political gain, showing little regard for the people she was supposed to be helping and the ethics rules she was supposed to be following.Pattons actions were far from an outlier in the Trump administration, where senior officials developed a years-long pattern of violating the Hatch Act, mostly with impunity. The Republican National Convention alone presented a tsunami of potential violations of the law, from former acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf hosting a naturalization ceremony during primetime to former Secretary of State Mike Pompeos decision to address the RNC from Jerusalem to the location of its closing night on the White House lawn.In October 2020 alone, CREW found that 16 Trump officials had violated the Hatch Act an astonishing 60 times, including first daughter/senior adviser Ivanka Trump, son-in-law/senior adviser Jared Kushner, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, trade honcho Peter Navarro, and communications director Alyssa Farahbut the administrations seniormost officials were openly contemptuous of the law, which forbids using a government position or government resources for political purposes.Nobody outside of the Beltway really caresthey expect that Donald Trump is going to promote Republican values and they would expect that Barack Obama, when he was in office, that he would do the same for Democrats, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadowsa onetime stickler for the Hatch Acttold Politico in August, calling concerns by ethics experts a lot of hoopla.Or, as former White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said shortly before the Office of Special Counsel determined that she should have been removed from government service for her repeated violations of the Hatch Act: Blah, blah, blah Let me know when the jail sentence starts.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

As more financial institutions begin to invest in what many are now referring to as digital gold, the world is inching closer to a massive paradigm shift that could leave people looking back at traditional currency the same way they look at ancient bartering systems. These days, its becoming much more common to come across a friend or co-worker whos excited to talk about how awesome Bitcoin is. While numbers vary depending on the source, its estimated that 80% to 90%of Americans are familiar with some type of cryptocurrency. Thats a shockingly high level of awareness and is indicative of just how far cryptocurrency has come since its inception. Now, with 10% of Americansowning Bitcoin, its important for people to have a basic understanding of how the currency operates and the mysterious history behind its creation. What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin was created in 2009 using the plans laid out in a whitepaperwritten by someone under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The true identity of Bitcoins originator has never been revealed, leaving room for speculation among the crypto community and Bitcoin detractors. There are rumors that if Nakamoto were to ever reveal his true identity the entire Bitcoin market could destabilize and come crashing to the ground. However, theres no evidence that Nakamoto, or anyone for that matter, holds anything but a limited influence on the market. In fact, what makes Bitcoin revolutionary is that it is completely decentralized, free from the constraints that come with fiat or government-controlled currencies. More importantly, though, unlike traditional fiat, theres a finite supply of Bitcoin. Nakamoto intentionally set the limit on the number of Bitcoin that could ever exist to 21 million. You might also like: Bitcoin Games on the Gaming Market? Is It True? Although the reason behind setting the supply specifically to 21 million remains a mystery, this limitation essentially prevents Bitcoin from falling into inflation. So while governments can keep printing fiat until the trees run out, Bitcoin functions as a limited commodity similar to gold, minus the physical limitations of a heavy metal brick. What Are Blockchains? Like any other precious metal thats bought and traded on the market, Bitcoin is procured through a process known as mining. Unlike its physical counterparts, though, Bitcoin is mined electronically using powerful processors. The process may seem complex, but basically, each Bitcoin transaction is processed by a large network of computers running specialized software. During a transaction, the software records both the senders and receivers Bitcoin addresses along with the amount transferred, and it enters that information onto a blockchain Anyone put off by the introduction of another amorphous digital term can simplify things by thinking of a blockchain as a virtually counterfeit-proof database. Its essentially a group of encrypted transactions permanently linked together. Every Bitcoin transaction is added to a block, and when that block is full, its chained to another block  hence the blockchain name. During this procedure, every single computer that processes Bitcoin verifies each blockchains accuracy, ensuring that it is nearly impossible to counterfeit. Simple enough, right? Well, the important thing to remember is that blockchain is the technology that makes Bitcoin work in a safe and secure manner. However, this technology isnt limited to securing cryptocurrency. While Bitcoinhas been around since 2009, recently, there has been a whole new crypto investment phenomenon that is even more difficult to understand than digital money. What Are Nonfungible Tokens (NFTs)? Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, are taking the internet by storm. NFTs are encrypted digital tokens that use the same blockchain storage method as Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, each NFT is distinct and cannot be exchanged equally for other NFTs. To put it simply, a $100 bill can be traded for another $100 bill because theres no difference in value between the two; thats what makes them fungible. A nonfungible asset, however, cannot be exchanged the same way. You might also like: Many Eco-Friendly Companies Are Just Pretending To Be Good for the Earth Theres a lot of utility behind NFTs, as they can be used to represent items both physically and digitally. Oddly enough, many of the most valuable NFTs have been digital images of physical artwork or trading cards. To add to the apparent absurdity of NFTs as a concept, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey recently sold an NFT of a link to the first-ever tweet for a whopping $2.9 million . Individuals unfamiliar with NFTs will read that and be completely dumbfounded by the idea of anyone paying such a price for something that could easily be saved as a screenshot. Its true that the value of NFTs is subjective; however, their real value comes from the same technology that makes Bitcoinwork so well. The encrypted address behind each NFT is added to a blockchain, making it a permanent and transparent asset that can be verified by anyone. So while anybody can save a screenshot of the first-ever tweet, only one copy of the NFT sold by Dorsey exists. Its this combination of digital representation and blockchain security that makes NFTs distinct assets. You might also like:",https://studybreaks.com/thoughts/nfts-bitcoin-blockchains/

According to blockchain data pulled from this journalists Bitcoin node, the result of the coin toss has determined that Taproots activation timeline will be measured using median time passed (MTP) instead of block height. For the actual toss, the last digit of the block 678079s hash were used to decide the outcome where a value of 0 represented MTP and a value of 1 represented height. Screenshot of coin flip result (Colin Harper) Taproot  an upgrade that will enrich Bitcoins smart contracts is all set to go using the Speedy Trialactivation method outlined a month ago. Todays coin toss settled a dispute, though, over how the Bitcoin blockchain will measure the time that has passed between when the upgrade is released and when it will time-out. Block height vs. MTP There were two options up for debate: one using block height, which chooses a timeout that triggers once a specific block is mined and the other using MTP, which chooses the timeout based on real-world time derived from block data. Subscribe to Subscribe By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditionsand privacy policy The coin toss occurred on block 678079 and the result landed on MTP Following the result, Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow removed his pull request for a block height-based scheme. MTP means that when Taproots code is shipped, miners and node operators will have a time period of exactly three months to upgrade to Taproot before a timeout period is reached. If miners representing 90% of Bitcoins hashrate upgrade in this timeframe, then Taproot is locked in and it will activate three months after this lock-in. Assuming Taproot is shipped by May, this means the upgrade would be fully functional on the Bitcoin blockchain no later than November. We have two good options, and coin flip is people agreeing to put aside minute preferences on two acceptable options for the big picture, Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin wrote in a Bitcoin devlist email As such, I think that a coin flip is appropriately used in this circumstance, although I recognize the sentiment that some may feel its treating development a little too *flippantly*.

nasdaq,NotProvided,2021-04-03 19:57:58,3 Blockchain Stocks to Buy in 2021,"Blockchain is a record-keeping system first developed by the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. The premise is simple: Transactions are grouped into blocks, validated by miners, and stored in a chronological ""chain"" across all nodes (computers) in a network. This",". Here's what investors need to know about how blockchain could impact the futures of these three companies. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Microsoft In 2018, Microsoft partnered with the giant U.K. consultancy EY (still well-known by its former name, Ernst & Young) to build a blockchain network that automates video game royalty payments. Specifically, the network makes it possible to code smart digital contracts that self-execute as transactions occur, improving transparency and efficiency for Microsoft, game publishers, and developers. Publishers can now access royalty information in minutes, rather than the 45 days it took before. And Xbox finance operations are now 70% more efficient, according to Rohit Amberker, finance director of the Royalties and Content Operations team. This royalty payment solution is powered by Microsoft's Azure Blockchain Service, a platform that simplifies the development of blockchain networks and applications. But other customers use the service as well, and their solutions are equally impressive. For instance, General Electric Aviation has built a blockchain network to track airplane parts. That's important because airlines can't use any part unless they know its full history, which leads to substantial waste in the aviation industry. Notably, this solution allows the company to access verified data in real time, eliminating the need for inefficient tracking via paper documents. In fact, blockchain efficiencies could improve the industry's revenue by as much as 4% per year, or $40 billion, according to some analysts. Starbucks uses Azure blockchain technologies to ensure its products are sourced ethically. Using the mobile app, consumers can scan a code on the company's packaged coffee and find out exactly where the beans were grown. The network also allows farmers to trace the movements of what they produce, providing valuable transparency. For example, some farmers may not know their product is export grade, so this technology gives them insight into the quality of their beans. As more enterprises adopt blockchain-powered solutions, Microsoft's global cloud computing platform should make the company a key player in the space. 2. PayPal PayPal benefits from blockchain in a more traditional sense. In October, the company started allowing users in the U.S. to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin and three other digital currencies through the PayPal app. The company plans to bring the same functionality to Venmo and international markets in the coming months. Its fintech rival Square has allowed its Cash App users to trade Bitcoinsince 2018. Since that time, Cash App users and user engagement have both trended upward, driving a significant increase in gross profit. PayPal should see similar benefits in the coming quarters, but the company has even bigger plans. Last month, PayPal launched its Checkout with Crypto service, allowing consumers to make purchases with Bitcoin (and a few other digital currencies) directly from the PayPal app. Eventually, the company plans to make this option available for all of its 29 million merchants. That would be a big step toward legitimizing cryptocurrencyas a form of payment, and it could be a powerful growth driver for PayPal in the coming years. 3. Salesforce Salesforce helps its clients develop and maintain relationships with their own customers. Specifically, the Salesforce Customer 360 platform unifies data from sales, customer service, marketing, finance, and other departments, making it easy for different teams to work together. As part of Customer 360, Salesforce offers a low-code application platformthat makes it possible for anyone to develop software, even if they don't understand computer code. As a longtime innovator, Salesforce recognized blockchain's potential in 2019 and incorporated it into its low-code platform. Clients can now build blockchain-powered networks and applications through Salesforce, similar to the way Microsoft's clients use Azure Blockchain Service. While this hasn't been a notable growth driver so far, it adds substantial value to Salesforce's platform. Blockchain has the potential to reshape numerous industries, and Salesforce is well-positioned to capitalize on that trend. 10 stocks we like better than Microsoft When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The use of the tool, however, is spreading to sectors that are not necessarily linked to cryptocurrencies. With the arrival of the pandemic in Brazil, for example, blockchain is gaining more and more utility when being used for document authentication without having to leave home. One tool that is taking advantage of technology is e-Notoriado. In December last year, the digital authentication function was adopted by the platform and, in four months, about 156 thousand pages of documents have already been authenticated by the blockchain system. Thus, users can share the documents via WhatsApp, email, SMS or any other messaging application, which will continue to have the same legal value as the original file. But what is blockchain? The blockchain concept was born in 2008, with the creation of Bitcoin. The technology was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto, pseudonym of the supposed creator of the cryptocurrency, to prevent data from being altered, copied or exchanged in the virtual environment. As a result, transactions are safer, preventing a person from spending 1 BTC twice or saying that they sent 10 BTC and transferring a smaller amount, for example. To this day, the currencys cryptography is intact, with no successful attempt at fraud. In summary, the technology uses pieces of code generated online, connects the information in blocks, forming a chain. The trick here is that each block has information from the previous one, that is, if someone wants to invade the chain, they will need to unveil the code of all previous blocks. Blockchain Company Ripple's Value Reaches $ 10 Billion Blockchain on Authentications The authentication process, according to the President of Colgio Notarial do Brasil, Giselle Oliveira, is carried out through Notarchain, a private blockchain network of notaries. The process takes place in the same way: the requested document has a unique code that will be deposited in a block with all the transactions in that network. From there, a chain is built, in which each block is linked to the previous one, making it impossible to change the information that has already been stored. The document registered by user A in Minas Gerais can be verified by a notary at the request of user B in Tocantins. This user B, with the certified copy in PDF, can also request the printed document of the original document that it came from Minas Gerais, by user A, guaranteeing faithful reproduction and its legal effects , explains Oliveira. She explains that the process is fast, as well as the face-to-face procedure, but recommends that the service be scheduled in advance.

Digital currencies like Bitcoin work on whats called the blockchain. Thats a distributed digital ledger U.S. Rep. Bill Foster, D-Naperville, says is non-falsifiable. Something that you cannot go and make a counterfeit copy of something thats already been published on the blockchain, Foster said. And so that will prevent a lot of document fraud. With Chinas central bank looking at its own digital currency, Foster is pushing for Congress to investigate making a digital dollar in cooperation with the Federal Reserve central bank. The United States is playing catch-up to the rest of the world when it comes to digital currency, and if were going to protect the U.S. dollars status as the worlds reserve currency, we need to make development of secure and effective digital currency a priority, Foster said in a statement. In an interview, he said decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin are facilitating illicit actions. One of the border patrol agents told me that most of the payments made for human trafficking are now being made with Bitcoin, simply because it was not legally traceable, Foster said. Michael Busch, president and CEO of Burling Bank in Chicago, said what hes seen with digital currencies, the ledger is transparent and accountable. He also noted the U.S. dollar is being used for nefarious purposes. While we always have to be wary of bad actors, we cant let those concerns deter us from providing safe and sound products and services to compliant businesses, Busch said. Busch advocates for policies to foster the growth of blockchain technology in Illinois. Illinois lawmakers last month heard from Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations Chasse Rehwinkel about how such blockchain technology continues to be adopted by other states. Blockchain technology is not just being applied to financial institutions, but also its being looked at for government, healthcare, transpiration, different logistics issues, retail, travel and many other industries, Rehwinkel said. IDFPR produced a report at the end of last year with various recommendations Illinois could implement to foster blockchain technology and digital currencies. There is no general consensus among domestic regulatory bodies at either the state or federal level, according to the reports. However, certain states are making inroads in how to regulate this industry. Allowing banks and financial institutions to act as legal custodians for crypto-asset clients seems to be the regulatory path that both industry advocates and regulators want to pursue.",https://www.gmtoday.com/news/illinois/illinois-officials-evaluating-how-to-facilitate-blockchain-technology-digital-currency/article_8a485ae0-9484-11eb-b1d8-375d0ae6dfb7.html

But the real game changer could be the underlying blockchain technology. In this Fool Live video clip, recorded on March 18, Gemini cryptocurrency exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss explains to The Motley Fool's Anand Chokkavelu why decentralized finance is such an important innovation. Anand Chokkavelu: What's something in the blockchain/crypto universe most people today can't envision at all, but will take for granted five years from now? Cameron Winklevoss: I think one of the most interesting developments has been decentralized finance. That's really had a boon over the past year, where people are building projects that are permissionless, where you can lend and borrow funds. You can trade. You can just show up to these smart contracts and send your collateral in and transact, you don't actually need permission to do that. It's really rearchitecting big pieces of the financial system in a decentralized, permissionless manner, which is super exciting, and it's all being built on Ethereum. I think the next question a lot of people would have would be, ""How do I invest in this wave?"" The simplest answer is that you could invest in projects directly, but then you have to pick winners, so to speak. If you think of Ethereum as basically this decentralized computer, and Ethereum is like Manhattan, and buying ether is like buying a parcel of land, and these projects are like skyscrapers. By owning the land as people build on top of it, build these skyscrapers, that brings value to you as a property holder. Really the weighted index DeFi, which I think is one of the most important frontiers being built in crypto today. You can simply buy Ethereum, and then you have a pro rata share of this piece of land that all this good stuff being built on top of it. A lot of that value accrues to ether holders, because these projects require you to use ether to use them. So they are ether eaters, and they create demand. What we've been telling folks, and again, this is not financial advice, just want to say that. A lot of folks approach us and they say, ""Hey, how should I enter crypto?"" Our view is Bitcoin's the entry point, it's the store of value, it's the oldest, it's the most liquid, it has the largest market cap. We've been in it personally for almost nine years now. Bitcoin's really the starting point, but Ethereum is a place where it makes a lot of sense to have chips on the board. Whether that's a 70-30 breakdown between Bitcoin or Ethereum, or 60-40, 50-50, that's a personal decision. I think that's what we've been discussing with folks who ask us, how do I approach this space? Because Ethereum indexes so much of this amazing activity that's going on, and then Bitcoin is that digital gold. I think if you look at the performance, Bitcoin's done incredibly well, and Ethereum's done well, too. I think individuals are well served to look at both of those projects.

But the industry needs to have a robust security apparatus in place. As the demand for cryptocurrencies increased, it was accompanied by increased cases of hackers breaking into the networks. It is astonishing to know that there around 29 incidents of hacking in the Bitcoin industry between 2013-17. The incidents of hacking into digital assets of crypto networks rose to around US$ 1.8 billion in the first ten months of 2020. Hackers are using newer methods to lure crypto traders and laying their hands-on digital assets. Crypto exchanges must ensure they secure their networks and the primary way to do this is to install an SSL certificate The incidents of hacking do not discriminate between regions or the stature of the exchange. For example, there have been hacking incidents at KuCoin  among the largest in South East Asia. There was also an attack at Exmo  registered in the UK and serves clients in Ukraine and Russia. This article will delve deep into how the use of Blockchain can help in internet security. INTRODUCTION TO THE FUTURE OF SSL CERTIFICATES Like all other industries, it is the sense of trust that brings users to any crypto exchange. It will help in building an ideal relationship between the exchange and the customers. As there is an increase in attacks, users must check the websites they are visiting. One of the common ways hackers use to target your assets is to use a URL like the renowned crypto exchanges. There have been several incidents where this was done, including the attack on Binance. Crypto exchanges must also imbibe security best practices to thwart such data breaches. Apart from the loss of trust, it can also lead to hefty fines and permanent brand image loss. Why are SSL Certificates Important? In general, it is necessary for organizations running an online business to provide adequate security for their customers. Usually, online shops store a lot of personal information about their customers. Hackers are always on the prowl to gain unauthorized access to such critical data. In the case of crypto exchanges, they store financial information too about the customers. It becomes necessary for crypto exchanges to provide a secure site that will ensure that the customers can transact without the fear of their digital assets being accessed by hackers. With an increase in the number of hacking incidents, visitors to any website also look for the address bars padlock sign and HTTPS. It helps ensure that the website they are visiting has security in place to prevent data sniffing. SSL certificates are used on websites that allow customers to transact online. Financial institutions, e-commerce sites, social networks, etc., all use them to ensure proper security is in place for web security. It will help to create a safe connection between the web server and the browser. When a customer makes a payment, the financial information will be encrypted before it is sent to the server. What is Blockchain? One of the issues with SSL certificates is that it is based on Certificate Authorities (CAs) who have to issue certificates but may fail to adhere to the validation process. It can be adequately addressed using blockchain technology. The procedure used in this technology can be used to secure digital communication and can also be used for authentication. Blockchain is a verified record of any critical data. The data blocks are all in chronological order, and they cannot be altered or modified over time. It is a decentralized public ledger that can be shared among users to form an array of transactions. They are timestamped and permanently connected to the previous chain. It uses cryptography that uses a different key to encrypt and decrypt data. As a result, it can also protect the completed transactions and prevent any changes. Blockchain also ensures the security of the data across the network. The entities can have their unique cryptographic keys that can be used to verify and, hence, secure the underlying information. How can Blockchain help in Cybersecurity? Decentralisation. One of the essential benefits is that you do not need any third-party verification due to the P2P (peer-to-peer) network. Any user can see the network transactions. Moreover, there is no central storage location, and all users can store some portions or the whole portion of the Blockchain. The users have to verify the data shared or stored to prevent any unauthorized data from being added. Confidentiality. Blockchain uses a public-key cryptography mechanism that can be used to authenticate the participants. The details of the participants are kept confidential, and their operations are being encrypted too. The Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) can verify the digital signatures validity without disclosing the keys. Integrity. There is a distributed register that ensures data protection and prevents any unauthorized access and alteration. The use of Blockchain ensures the irreversibility and validity of the completed transactions. Even during any DDoS attack, the system can continue to work in the normal mode. Fraud prevention. To corrupt a blockchain, hackers have to destroy the data that is stored at all the locations. It is challenging to bring down entire networks as the chains can be stored on several computers. The complexity of penetrating more extensive networks makes it have a lower risk of attack from hackers. Why is there a need to use Blockchain-based systems? The SSL/ TLS technology has been in use for a long time and is still a widely used technology for the internet. One of the critical factors of this technology is that centralized CAs issued it. However, the Heartbleed bug of OpenSSL had businesses scrambling to reissue their SSL certificates. There was an inherent to search for more advanced technologies. The use of Blockchain will help to secure digital transactions. The Blockchain Originated Certificate of Authenticity (BOCA) can help secure online information transfer across different websites. This protocol utilizes advanced technologies to validate users and ensure that the underlying user details are secure. Wherever Blockchain has been used, it improves the authentication mechanism that can be done without passwords. The PKI technology used in SSL/TLS is vulnerable to cyberattacks and is not used in Blockchain. On the other hand, Blockchain can be updated only through proper consensus. The various participants must consent to any changes in the chain, and anything entered in the chain cannot be altered. They can be verified and audited easily. Blockchain can also preserve the metadata that is being used in the interaction and can help to prevent any data breach. One of the other factors to consider is that Blockchain must observe the regulations that require complying with Anti-Money Laundering and the Know Your Customer norms. The technology cannot act as the validating authority like the CAs who can manually verify the legit",https://signalscv.com/2021/04/the-future-of-ssl-certificates-is-it-blockchain/

The governments 7 billion rand ($474 million) commitment required a material change to previous versions of plans to deliver on the lenders development and transformation objective, it said in response to emailed questions.An agreement would have bought the state-owned bank more time in servicing a facility with Standard Chartered, the lone holdout from the restructuring talks, after a court ordered it pay back 400 million rand in December. Land Bank has now pledged to pay the remaining 352 million rand it owes to Standard Chartered by Thursday.Related: Moodys Withdraws All Ratings for South Africas Land BankThe bank continues to engage with the rest of its financial creditors to ensure that the interests of all parties are prudently served, it said.In DefaultLand Bank has been battling to repay its debt and extend credit since a drought caused many of its customers to default on their loans. Last April, the Pretoria-based institution missed a loan repayment that triggered a cross-default in notes issued under a 50 billion-rand bond program.The bank has been in talks with a consortium of creditors for about a year and is negotiating its third proposal to emerge from default.While Standard Chartereds success in court could spur other creditors to seek similar recourse, only a minority would likely consider this option, according to Jones Gondo, a credit research analyst at Nedbank Ltd.What should guide creditors now is the approach that will maximize their recovery, Gondo said.Standard Chartered declined to comment.The London-based banks history in South Africa spans 150 years. It divested in 1987 when it sold its stake in Standard Bank Group but returned five years later independently and was granted a full-service banking license in 2003. Its business in the country is now mainly focused on corporate and institutional banking activities, according to its website.Lifeline to FarmersLand Bank extends credit to commercial and emerging black farmers as South Africa aims to redress imbalances from racial-segregation policies ended in 1994. It must now decide how it will manage these dual interests, and quickly.A breakthrough in negotiations with creditors would bode well for confidence as South Africa looks to stabilize other larger state-owned companies such as power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. The nations finances have been strained by support to unprofitable state-owned companies, deep-seated corruption and a wage bill that has jumped 40% over the past 12 years.The manner in which the government is approaching Land Bank, however, is probably related to how much of its capital structure it guarantees, Gondo said.Eskom is different because of the guarantees, he said. In short, the National Treasury behaves differently depending on its contingent risk assessment.Land Bank expects its eventual agreement with lenders to shape its balance-sheet resizing and other strategic choices, it said.There are concerns about the time its taking to get to a solution, as well as the increased complexity and increased uncertainty introduced by the most recent version of its proposal, Olga Constantatos, head of credit at Futuregrowth Asset Management, said in a note.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 18h ago Princes Late-Night Dividend Announcement May Help Aramco (Bloomberg) -- The Saudi Arabian crown princes late-night announcement that Aramco could reduce payouts to the state will potentially alleviate the strain on the oil giants balance sheet.The details are still unclear -- the move took investors by surprise and the company said on Thursday it was still committed to paying dividends.But the move could free up some of the $73.5 billion of annual dividend payments Aramco makes to the government, which owns 98% of the company. Payouts to minority shareholders, who get roughly $1.5 billion, will be maintained -- as promised in the terms of a 2019 initial public offering.The worlds largest oil company has seen its debt levels soar in the last year due to the coronavirus-triggered collapse in energy prices and its $69 billion acquisition of chemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp. The Dhahran-based firm had to cut spending and borrow more to pay the dividend for 2020, with free cash flow falling substantially below that level to $49 billion.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said on Tuesday that 24 of the kingdoms biggest companies could decrease their dividends and instead contribute 5 trillion riyals ($1.33 trillion) of domestic capital spending over the next 10 years. Around 60% of that money will come from Aramco and Sabic, the 35-year-old de facto ruler said.He said the extra investment from the firms would boost the economy.Capex only drives higher long-term growth if it is on productive projects which create value and jobs, said Hasnain Malik, the head of research at Tellimer in Dubai. Otherwise, this is simply a case of the government reallocating capital in a centralized, command-economy fashion, further neutering the private sector.The prince didnt specify by how much Aramco might cut its government payout, or whether the company could retain some of the money on its balance sheet instead of investing it all.Aramcos dividends represent about one third of the Saudi governments total revenue.The firm remains committed to ensuring free cash flow to support dividend distributions through various market conditions and crude oil price cycles, it said in a statement to Bloomberg on Thursday.Aramcos shares rose 2.7% on Tuesday, the most since May, to 36 riyals. Trading volumes were more than four times the average of the past month, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.The new plan comes after the pandemic and oil shock pushed Saudi Arabia into recession and set back the governments goal of slashing unemployment and diversifying the economy.Aramco said earlier this month that capital spending in 2021 would be $35 billion, down from earlier guidance of as much as $45 billion. The company has a raft of projects on the horizon, including fulfilling a government edict to increase its total oil production capacity to 13 million barrels a day, from 12 million a day.(Updates with company comments in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 9h ago Billionaire Westons Trade Food for Property, Seeking Growth (Bloomberg) -- Groceries helped the billionaire Weston fa",http://finance.yahoo.com/news/future-fintech-stock-trading-higher-124412814.html

The company announced the effort in a regulatory filing last month.AMC could use the shares to bolster its cash reserve, buy back debt at a discount, settle deferred theater rents or pursue an acquisition, Aron said. The shares have soared over the past six months, benefiting from a Reddit-fueled investing frenzy that sent heavily shorted stocks into the stratosphere.There are a lot of good reasons for shareholders to give us the authority, Aron said.Shares of the Leawood, Kansas-based company fell as much as 6.4% to $9.56 in New York. The companys 12% second-lien notes due 2026 rose more than a cent on the dollar to a high of 82.88 cents, according to Trace bond trading data.AMC has raised more than $1 billion in financing this year, which helped stave off bankruptcy while its theaters were closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company said previously it might seek more financing, and some creditors have suggested it sell more shares to pay down debt.Theater chains have been hard hit by government-mandated shutdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic. While the company has been able to reopen all but a small portion of its locations, its still operating at limited capacity to ensure extra space for customers, and many moviegoers have been reluctant to attend. The problem has been compounded by studios delaying major releases that drive ticket sales.AMCs shares traded at historic lows for much of 2020 as the Covid-19 crisis engulfed the company.

What Happened: The company said that it more-than-doubled the number of BTC it held on its balance sheet at 1,078 BTC as of Dec. 31, as compared to 514 BTC on the same date a year earlier. BTC traded 0.43% higher at $59,127.58 making Riots holdings worth nearly $63.74 million at press time. Riot reported an increase in mining revenues by 116% to $5.2 million in Q4 2020 compared to $2.4 million for the preceding quarter. The company minted 303 BTC now worth $17.91 million in Q4, an increase of 36% over the Q3 figure of 222 BTC ($13.08 millionat press time). Riot said the increase in minting was driven primarily by the increase in the Companys hash rate combined with network hash rate and adjustments in network difficulty. Hash rate implies the total computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain such as one that underpins Bitcoin. Total mining revenue in 2020 was $12 million, which is a 78% year-on-year increase compared to the $6.7 million figure recorded in 2019. Net income on a GAAP basis during Q4 2020 was $3.9 million compared to a net loss of $3.4 million in the same period in 2019. In Q3 2020 Riot reported a loss of $1.7 million. Why It Matters: Riot said it is amplifying its growth initiatives which will drive further growth for the company including raising the U.S.-based share of the bitcoin mining landscape. Riot shares have rallied 213.5% since the year began and 6,793.1% on a net basis over one year. Several other BTC-related companies have also seen shares spike in Marchincluding Sos Ltd (NYSE:",http://feeds.benzinga.com/~r/benzinga/news/~3/Y5byu-s2zrk/riot-blockchain-records-460-rise-in-bitcoin-hashing-capacity-what-you-need-to-know
venturebeat,NotProvided,2021-03-29 13:30:00,Enjin raises $18.9M to launch NFT blockchain on Polkadot,Enjin raised $18.9 million to launch its dedicated non-fungible token (NFT) blockchain on Polkadot as a way to take NFTs to the next level.,"Enjin was founded in 2009, and it shifted to focus on NFTs in 2017, and it hopes to compete against Ethereum as the key platform for game-based tokens. One of its advantages is a more eco-friendly design, as Enjin has released a five-step plan to enable carbon-neutral NFTs by 2030. To date, the company has raised $37.8 million. Above: Enjin hopes South Korean gamers will be into its NFTs. Image Credit: Enjin One of the problems of early blockchain cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin is that they require lots of computing power to mine coins and verify authenticity, based on the  proof of work  design that required miners to solve complex computing puzzles. (The blockchain is a transparent and secure ledger that can be verified by pools of computers working together.) But Enjin is moving to proof-of-stake, where the blockchain verification depends on a smaller number of trusted computing partners to verify data. That method of verification doesnt use as much energy. The challenge is that not as many users are familiar with Enjin, in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Caleb Applegate, chief operating officer at Enjin, said in a statement that NFTs should be for everyone. And building with Polkadot will enable Enjin to deliver an accessible, scalable solution that empowers everyone to participate in the emerging NFT economy. With the end-user in mind, Efinity will provide a fun, simple, and accessible experience for all, he said. While transactions on Ethereum are slow at 15 per second, Efinity is set to process transactions every 6 seconds and will use proof of stake to scale to 1,000 transactions per second. Enjin is also developing a new cross-chain token standard called Paratoken that will enable any fungible or non-fungible token from any blockchain to be moved onto the Efinity network and then used throughout the Polkadot ecosystem. Paratokens are an advancement of the ERC-1155 NFT standard that Enjin pioneered in 2017, which has since been adopted by companies like Microsoft, Nike, and OpenSea. Above: Enjins Efinity Image Credit: Enjin Enjin has hundreds of thousands of communities on its platform, with more than 20 million users on the original platform. The company switched to NFTs four years ago and built an ecosystem to enable developers to add blockchain to their games. About 40 game companies are using it so far, and Enjin has built bridges to other platforms such as Ethereum. Digital assets should exist in a metaverse of blockchains, said Witek Radomski, chief technology officer of Enjin, in a statement. He said that opening up liquidity across multiple blockchains and use-cases will connect a broad ecosystem of creators, buyers, and sellers. The team has released a whitepaperdetailing the new Efinity Token (EFI), designed for transaction fees, liquidity, and yield farming through staking Enjin Coin (ENJ). Community governance will enable EFI holders to submit and vote on proposals to steer the future of the network. Initially, Enjin has allocated 15% of the total supply of EFI that users can earn by staking ENJ on Efinity and minting tokens with ENJ. ENJ stakers will also earn EFI collected from network fees, marketplace commissions, cross-chain bridging tolls, and smart contract fees. Enjin will invest further development into Snowforks open-source bridges to enable NFTs to flow between Polkadot, Ethereum, and other blockchains. Starting with NFT.io, marketplaces on Efinity will reward bidders with EFI, creating perpetual liquidity for all assets and allowing collectors to see an up-to-date valuation of their NFT portfolios.

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075).

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

dailyfx,NotProvided,2021-04-01 17:47:50,"Bitcoin Tumbles Amid Xinjiang Blackout, Possible US Treasury Investigation",Bitcoin prices tumbled lower amid news of a possible US Treasury investigation into the crypto space and a blackout in the Chinese BTC mining region of Xinjiang.,"Start Quiz Bitcoin prices tumbled lower overnight, falling as much as 15.7% to the lowest levels since March 26, before climbing back to finish just shy of 6% down on the day. The substantial sell-off appears to be linked to news that the US Treasury is opening an investigation into instances of money laundering carried out through the use of digital assets. However, this has yet to be confirmed or substantiated, with the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stating that it does not comment on potential investigations, including on whether or not one exists. Bitcoin 5-minute Chart Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Nevertheless, the possibility of regulatory intervention in the crypto space could certainly have spooked investors and incited liquidation of exposed positions. A blackout in Xinjiang may also be behind the notable decline in the price of the heavily-traded cryptocurrency. The region is responsible for almost half of the Bitcoin mining network and was offline for 48 hours due to maintenance works at several power stations in mainland China. This ultimately led to the Bitcoin hashrate declining dramatically, which may have in turn driven BTC prices lower, considering the Bitcoin hashrate is positively correlated to price. That being said, it is yet to be seen if this correction will garner follow-through given the  one of the worlds most prominent crypto exchanges  and the adoption of digital assets by several well-known financial institutions and companies. Bitcoin Daily Chart  Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview From a technical perspective, the outlook for BTC/ USD appears relatively bearish, as prices break Rising Wedge support and plunge below all three short-term moving averages. Above average volume in combination with the RSI plunging below its neutral midpoint, and a bearish crossover taking place on the MACD indicator, suggests that the path of least resistance is lower. A daily close below 57,000 probably opens the door for sellers to drive BTC back to psychological support at 51,000. Breaching that could intensify selling pressure and propel the anti-fiat digital asset towards the sentiment-defining 144-EMA (41075). However, if the trend-defining 55-EMA (55019) remains intact, a rebound back towards the yearly high (64829) is certainly not out of the question. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/19/Bitcoin-Tumbles-Amid-Xinjiang-Blackout-Possible-US-Treasury-Investigation.html

barrons,NotProvided,2021-04-16 21:56:21,Should You Buy Coinbase Stock? Yes. Why Its Barrons Pick to Play the Bitcoin Boom.,The crypto platform started trading at a $100 billion valuation. Why the stock is worth much more.,"Nasdaq (NDAQ). But Coinbase is already more than that. Sure, anyone can buy Bitcoin from a brokerage like Robinhood, but in most cases they cant use it as a token within a cryptocurrency system, earn interest off it, or move it off the platform. Coinbase has burgeoning operations in areas like staking, which allows crypto holders to lend their crypto holdings and earn interest. And a recent acquisition of a blockchain infrastructure company called Bison Trails could put Coinbase on a path to becoming the Microsoft Azure of blockchain, Ellis says. When Coinbase was founded in 2012, CEO Brian Armstrong was taking a leap into the unknown. There was no regulation or market structure in the crypto world and handling it involved legal and reputational risks. Two years later, its chief rival imploded. Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that once handled as much as 70% of Bitcoin trading volume, suddenly lost 850,000 of its clients Bitcoin. In contrast, Coinbase developed more slowly than unregulated exchanges, taking a more traditional route by raising money from venture capitalists and making sure to check off regulatory boxes as it grew. Customers sometimes gripe about the amount of time it takes to verify their documents before they can trade crypto. But the effort has paid off. I think the fact that Coinbase was a U.S.-based venture-backed start-up, put it on a different trajectory, which was one of being a well-lit venue, thats well-regulated, and in constant dialogue with regulators and lawmakers, Tom Loverro, a Coinbase investor, tells Barrons. This was set up to be a corporation. Loverro is a partner at venture-capital firm IVP, which led a funding round for Coinbase in 2017. That often-onerous regulatory processculminating in approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the public listingis now a competitive advantage that will be hard for others to surmount, says R.A. Farrokhnia, a professor at Columbia Business School who has been teaching crypto and blockchain for years. At the time, the strategy stood out because so many others felt it was easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. There are several bear cases on Coinbase stock. Regulation is sure to get more strict in some areas of cryptocurrency. Regulators have already raised questions about Coinbases activities; the Commodity Futures Trading Commission found that the company delivered reckless false, misleading, or inaccurate reporting about trades between 2015 and 2018, leading to a settlement where Coinbase agreed to pay $6.5 million without admitting or denying the claims. The most compelling bear argument may be that Coinbase is dependent on transaction fees, and financial transaction fees have a history of deflating as competition increases. Yet that is a narrow way to look at its business. I think the narrative of pricing pressure is mostly based on an analog to stocks, which doesnt apply here, because its a different bundle of services youre buying, Loverro says. A similar argument was made against Square and PayPal Holdings (PYPL) after their debuts, and that argument now seems quaint given all the areas those companies have entered, MoffettNathansons Ellis notes. Providing trading and custody services for cryptocurrencies is very different from facilitating stock-trading. The trade-off between security and liquidity is a precarious balancing act; crypto is safest when its in cold storage unconnected to the internet. But it cant trade without the internet. Coinbase has so far walked that tightrope like an acrobat, even as other exchanges have failed. For investors, the chief difference is that businesses focused on other financial assets are not growing with nearly the ferocity of Coinbase. The companys estimated $1.8 billion of revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was 40% higher than its revenue in all of 2020. Its market share of global crypto assets has grown to 11.3% from 4.8% in 2018, according to BTIG. Bitcoin will swing lower at some point. Yet Coinbase should be able to tap a number of revenue streams, thanks to its central position in the U.S. crypto-ecosystem. Look for its stock to mint digital gold.

marketwatch,NotProvided,2021-04-16 21:54:00,MarketWatch,The CEO of the startup said Coinbase's IPO shows how the public markets will receive cryptocurrency-related businesses.,"CEO Peter Smith said Blockchain.com is in no hurry to go ahead with an IPO. Dreamstime Add Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency wallet provider, to the list of companies weighing initial public offerings now that Coinbase Global has successfully navigated its trip to the public equity markets. Blockchain.com, of London, is a financial services company that is known for building crypto wallets for users to send, receive, and manage their Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, and ether. It employs about 200 people. The startup is contemplating life as a public company, according to co-founder and CEO Peter Smith. We would consider an IPO someday. But were not in a rush, Smith told Barrons. When asked about the timing of a possible Blockchain.com IPO, Smith said: Well have to wait and see. Blockchain.com is carefully considering its public-market options. Smith made the comments after Coinbase Global listed its shares earlier this week. Coinbase (ticker: COIN), the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., went public Wednesdaywith shares rising 32%. On Friday, the stock rose nearly 6% to $342, valuing Coinbase at $89.36 billion, versus a valuation of $65.3 billion at the reference price for the deal of $250. On Wednesday, Coinbases stock peaked at $429.54, valuing the exchange at $112.2 billion before dropping. The Coinbase IPO was interesting because it showed how the public markets will receive a crypto company, Smith said. Awareness of cryptocurrencies has improved, but not everyone understands them, Smith said. We havent even gotten to that point with the internet yet, he said. Crypto acceptance is better this year, and it is much improved compared with a decade ago, but we probably have a little bit further to go, he said. Blockchain.com is the latest crypto company to consider an IPO. Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange and one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges in the world, is also expected to go public Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is also said to be considering a listing. Founded in 2011, Blockchain.com has raised $500 million in funding since its founding This includes a $300 million round in Marchled by DST Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and VY Capital. The round valued Blockchain.com at $5.2 billion. Blockchain.com is looking to move beyond crypto. It provides a platform for retail and institutional clients to trade crypto while also supplying custody, clearing and settlement services. Smith wants to have foreign-currency exchange, corporate equities, options and other investment products, as well as cryptocurrencies, available on the platform by the end of 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported We just trade crypto. We will probably expand beyond that, said Smith, who declined to comment further.

aljazeera,NotProvided,2021-04-16 20:23:39,Dogecoin rally sends alt coin to $48bn market value,"Dogecoin is now up 18,000 percent from a year ago, when it traded for $0.002 and was worth about $250 million.","whatsapp While Coinbase Global Inc. captured the headlines with its market debut, the frenzy around digital tokens is taking its zaniest turn yet in the price of a token created as a joke. Dogecoin, boosted by the likes of Elon Musk and Mark Cuban, rallied roughly 180% Friday, according to CoinMarketCap.com, reaching a market value of more than $48 billion. Its now up 18,000% from a year ago, when it traded for $0.002 and was worth about $250 million. Doges surge is part of a rise in altcoins, a term for all the digital tokens that have sprung up in imitation of Bitcoin. Like most of them, its use case is limited, making it a tool for speculators and raising concern that a bubble is inflating in a crypto world now worth more than $2.25 trillion. This reminds me of the dot com days. We knew something big was going on, a lot of investors were chasing it hard. That led to a bubble, Scott Knapp, chief market strategist at CUNA Mutual Group, said. For every Amazon.com there were 10 pets.com that went bankrupt. Is Dogecoin the pets.com of the cryptocurrency era? Interest in crypto is on the rise again after companies from PayPal to Square started enabling transactions in Bitcoin on their systems, and Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley began providing access to the tokens to some of the wealthiest clients. All along, crypto diehards who say the blockchain technology will rewire the financial community have been plugging crypto, getting rich in the process. The Shiba-Inu themed Dogecoin was created as a joke by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013. Musk sparked a rally in it earlier this year when he posted a photo of a faux magazine Dogue featuring a dog in a red sweater. But Michael Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings, isnt buying the hype, since Dogecoin doesnt really have a purpose. Its reminiscent of GameStop, he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV, referring to the meme stock mania that gripped markets in February. I would be very, very worried if one of my friends was investing in Dogecoin at these prices. With little to back up the case for buying cryptocurrencies, the likelihood of them cratering remains high, leaving novice traders who jumped in on the hype vulnerable to steep losses. The government has pumped so much monetary and fiscal stimulus into the economy now, even worthless assets are being bid up, said Michael ORourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. Yet alt-coin popularity is hard to ignore. While Bitcoin is worth more than $1 trillion, the total market cap of the token universe now exceeds $2.25 trillion, according to CoinGecko.com, which tracks more than 6,700 coins. Bitcoins dominance in the crypto world has declined 28% since the beginning of the year, according to OKEX Insights Analyst Robbie Liu, citing data from Tradingview. The waning influence started to accelerate this month, he said in an email Friday, and Bitcoin now accounts for less than 54% of the crypto market capitalization  the lowest level in nearly two years. On the altcoins front, we continue to see strong momentum, said Pankaj Balani, the CEO of Delta Exchange, a leading crypto derivatives exchange, in a note Thursday. He noted Ethers recent record and increased activity in decentralized finance or DeFi, adding that decentralized exchange coins will be in focus in the next few days, given that the market has validated Coinbase at a $100 billion valuation. Other tokens with shaky to no fundamentals are also rising. Cardano and Polkadot, both in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, have surged this week. Polkadot and Cardano have very few users currently, said Shashwat Gupta, founder of Altcoinbuzz.io, in an email Wednesday, though he added that theres a substantial amount of development being built on them. And it looks like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong may have been on to something when he said after the listing that it marks a shift in legitimacy for crypto. The Coinbase listing ultimately will deliver more use cases for cryptos and should keep the crypto market growing, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for North America at Oanda Corp.

Farrokhnia, a professor at Columbia Business School who has been teaching crypto and blockchain for years. At the time, the strategy stood out because so many others felt it was easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. There are several bear cases on Coinbase stock. Regulation is sure to get more strict in some areas of cryptocurrency. Regulators have already raised questions about Coinbases activities; the Commodity Futures Trading Commission found that the company delivered reckless false, misleading, or inaccurate reporting about trades between 2015 and 2018, leading to a settlement where Coinbase agreed to pay $6.5 million without admitting or denying the claims. The most compelling bear argument may be that Coinbase is dependent on transaction fees, and financial transaction fees have a history of deflating as competition increases. Yet that is a narrow way to look at its business. I think the narrative of pricing pressure is mostly based on an analog to stocks, which doesnt apply here, because its a different bundle of services youre buying, Loverro says. A similar argument was made against Square and PayPal Holdings (PYPL) after their debuts, and that argument now seems quaint given all the areas those companies have entered, MoffettNathansons Ellis notes. Providing trading and custody services for cryptocurrencies is very different from facilitating stock-trading. The trade-off between security and liquidity is a precarious balancing act; crypto is safest when its in cold storage unconnected to the internet. But it cant trade without the internet. Coinbase has so far walked that tightrope like an acrobat, even as other exchanges have failed. For investors, the chief difference is that businesses focused on other financial assets are not growing with nearly the ferocity of Coinbase. The companys estimated $1.8 billion of revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was 40% higher than its revenue in all of 2020. Its market share of global crypto assets has grown to 11.3% from 4.8% in 2018, according to BTIG. Bitcoin will swing lower at some point. Yet Coinbase should be able to tap a number of revenue streams, thanks to its central position in the U.S. crypto-ecosystem. Look for its stock to mint digital gold.

Now, formulating a solid regulation and supervision system for it is the top priority; it needs to come before public blockchain is launched or admitted in the Chinese market.","Supervision comes first as China develops blockchain By Zhou Qing Source:Global Times Published: 2019/11/11 20:23:39 Illustration: Luo Xuan/GT China has gained the edge in blockchain technology. Now, formulating a solid regulation and supervision system for it is the top priority; it needs to come before public blockchain is launched or admitted in the Chinese market. According to a blockchain white paper released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology on Friday, China has obtained more than half of all blockchain patents globally and is home to about a quarter of global blockchain companies. This shows that blockchain innovation is on the rise in China. Despite the advantages China has in this new technology, it is still quite challenging for authorities to regulate and oversee it, which implies there are vulnerabilities which could be detrimental. The abuse of blockchain technology could pose dangers for China and Chinese people. Public blockchain is the dominant format internationally, while China's blockchain research emphasizes consortium blockchain. With multiple positive characteristics such as decentralization, anonymity, being tamper-proof and having lower costs, public blockchain has been widely adopted by Western countries. Consortium blockchain combines the decentralization of public blockchain and the high efficiency of private blockchain. Bitcoin, as the symbolic first generation of public blockchain technology, is frequently used as a transaction intermediary for illegal activities because there are methods to buy Bitcoin anonymously. When cryptocurrencies came to China, they stirred up speculation and generated chaotic initial coin offerings (ICO) which largely turned out to be fraudulent. Therefore, the authorities banned ICOs in September 2017 and put tighter regulations on tokens last year. Outside of China, Facebook is in the process of creating its cryptocurrency Libra and is ambitious enough to attempt the construction of financial infrastructure for the world. Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, drew connections between Libra and democratic values. Libra ""will extend America's financial leadership around the world as well as [its] democratic values and oversight,"" according to Zuckerberg's testimony which was released ahead of a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington last month. By highlighting US financial leadership and values, it seems Facebook is turning Libra into a weapon to reinforce US hegemony worldwide. China has to remember that US companies' ambition may someday infringe on China's national interests and clamp the country's financial system. Therefore, a proper supervision system in China should be built up to ensure blockchain technology will not be abused. Technologies to trace and detect public blockchain should be further researched and developed. This could establish boundaries of supervision. ""Any good technology or instrument will have to be in good hands and put into rightful use so that it can maximize its value,"" Chen Chun, director of the Blockchain Research Center at Zhejiang University and academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said in a note sent to Global Times on Monday. The once un-hackable blockchain has experienced an increasing number of loopholes over the past few years. According to the Wall Street Journal, more than $1.7 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen as of January 2019. As blockchain has permeated people's daily lives in China, regulation must play a role. Applications of blockchain technology have ""expanded from cryptocurrency in the early stage to multiple areas such as government administration, people's well-being and social management, as well as powering up the real economy,"" Cai Liang, who works in the same research team as Chen and is executive vice director of the Blockchain Research Center at Zhejiang University, told the Global Times on Monday. Blockchain technology poses challenges to regulation and supervision authorities. But Chinese policymakers are prepared. Several laws and regulations were passed earlier this year to build a legal system for blockchain technology. Any entity that provides blockchain services will have to a pass security evaluation conducted by the Internet Information Office before launching a new product, application or function. The system will require blockchain technology companies which operate within China to submit identification to verify authenticity, and will keep records. Aside from being subject to attacks from hackers, blockchain technology does have an Achilles heel. There have been reports that quantum computing could quickly decode blockchain cryptography. But the quantum computing technology required to do this is likely decades away from application. Blockchain, which has evolved three generations, will continue to advance. During this process, regulations and supervision will need to pay close attention to keep it on the right track.

investorplace,NotProvided,2021-04-16 13:16:08,"RIOT Stock Blows Through Numbers, Implying Shares Could Rise","Overall, Riot Blockchain blows through numbers -- implying RIOT stock could rise to new heights for these reasons.",") production estimates based on its expected mining hash rate over the next year and a half or so to the end of 2022. As a result, it looks like RIOT stock could still be significantly undervalued. Source: Marko Aliaksandr/ShutterStock.com In fact, based on the guidance the company provided it looks like by the end of 2022 Riot could be producing significantly more Bitcoins. Depending on the level of constantly rising difficulty to produce one BTC, this determines the number of Bitcoin that can be mined. For example, in the April 12 release Riot Blockchain indicated that its present hash rate was 4.0 exahash per second (EH/s) by the end of October 2021. However, now the company says by the end of 2021 its rate will be 5 EH/s and by the end of 2022, it will be 7.7 EH/s. In other words, its possible, depending on mining difficulty, to see the number of Bitcoins mined rise by 92.5% (i.e., 7.7 EH/ 4.0 EH) over the Q3 rate. The Q3 rate is also likely to be at least 10% higher than the Q1 rate. Therefore, expect revenue to be at least double by next year. In turn, that will push RIOT stock significantly higher over the next year. Production and Valuation Estimates The company blew through previous estimates and produced 491 Bitcoin, including 187 Bitcoin in March alone. Using the current Bitcoin price of about $61,600 implies revenue of $30.3 million. In reality, it will be lower given that the price of Bitcoin averaged a lower price in Q1. Moreover, the March production of 187 Bitcoin implies a quarterly run rate of 561 Bitcoin during Q2. But again in reality with the introduction of more ASIC miners (application-specific integrated circuits), the Q2 rate is likely to be higher. The bottom line is that analysts now expect Riot Blockchain will now produce $205.3 millionin revenue during 2021. Riot has 84.1 million shares outstanding, so at $44.40 now, the current market capitalization is $3.734 billion. This puts RIOT stock on a price-sales (P/S) ratio of 18.2 times for 2021. I believe 2022 revenue could be about twice the 2021 rate, depending on the Bitcoin mining difficulty rate, which cant be predicted. This lowers the P/S multiple to just 11.5 times for 2022. That is very cheap for such a fast-growing company. Where This Leaves RIOT Stock A conservative estimate would be 15 times next years revenue, or 15 times $205 times 2  or $6.15 billion. That is 31.76% higher than the current price price, or $58.50 (i.e., 1.3175 times $44.40 per share). Moreover, the company said that it now has accumulated over 1,565 BTC on its balance sheet. All of these Bitcoins were mined by the company. In other words, the company is profitable enough now where it does not have to sell all the BTC it mines. It can hold a portion of these mine production as long-term investments. Right now at $61,600 per BTC, this pile is worth $96.4 million. We can use that to estimate how fast this pile will grow. Lets assume it keeps 50% of the BTC it mines over the next year. Assuming an average of 200 BTC in 2021, this would imply 1,200 more BTC would be added to its investment holdings. That would be worth $75.6 million, bringing the total to $172 million. That represents 4.6% of current its market cap. We can use this as a buffer, or margin-of-safety, so to speak, in our $73.13 per share valuation for RIOT stock. But including it brings its per-share value to over $75.00. So far there is only one Wall Street analyst covering Riot His target price is at $64 per share or 44% above the current price. Typically, Wall Street analysts generally have a one-year outlook in their price targets. My estimate at $73.13, which is much higher higher than the current price reflects a two-year price target, including all the latest information the company recently provided.

The fans, who purchased the tokens via the Socios.com app, voted the British featherweight's bout with Brazil's Sheymon Moraes as ""The People's Main Event"" when the league resumes on April 23 after a long layoff due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Advertisement Advertisement ""It's not something I've ever been a part of before, but we won, so I can't complain!"" Loughnane told Reuters as a decision usually handled by promoters and matchmakers was handed to fans. ""I think this is the way things are going to go. When I first started in this sport, you fought in old sports halls with men smoking cigarettes, so for me it's bizarre, the way things are changing, but I'm moving with the times,"" he said. ""The world's moving fast, you have to be open nowadays and I'm kind of glad the way it's going,"" added the 31-year-old who has not fought since beating Brazilian David Valente on Dec. 31 2019. A blockchain is a database shared across a network of computers. Once a record has been added to the chain it is very difficult to change. The computer network makes constant checks to ensure all copies of the database are the same. Advertisement Advertisement Blockchains are used to underpin cyber-currencies like bitcoin and other uses are emerging. Socios.com partners with some of the world's biggest soccer clubs, such as Barcelona, Juventus and Paris St-Germain, and the PFL is the first sports league to join the platform. Originally priced at US$2, the first tranche of 300,000 PFL fan tokens sold out quickly, with thousands of fans using their tokens to vote for Loughnane to top the card. ""It's about creating a digital way to give fans a share of influence in the fan-related experience,"" Socios.com CEO Alex Dreyfus told Reuters, adding that he expected to add more clubs and leagues to the platform during 2021. Advertisement The PFL uses a regular-season format followed by playoffs and a championship bout across six weight classes, with each winner pocketing US$1 million in prize money and Loughnane said he might make some alternative investments if he wins. ""I've got investments, I've got some properties and I'm starting to get into the crypto world, having a go at that. I think I have another good two or three years left in me where I'm at my peak,"" he said. But there is a downside to the blockchain-powered popularity for Loughnane, who has a huge fanbase in his native Manchester. ""It's a double-edged sword - I was due to open the card and fight at 5:30pm in America, which is half-past ten back home, but now it's going to be a bit later for fans in England!"" he said.

Bitcoin Apr 16, 2021, 6:46 pm Bitcoins rise to fame was triggered by the bull market phase, which had a great impact on Bitcoin price. Namely, the price of Bitcoin had recently surpassed $60,000, while it has a continual growth since 2020, with many notable records including a price of $20,000 in December. This has resulted in an ever-rising number of retail and institutional investors. In fact, the demand from institutional investors that include crypto and Bitcoin trust investment funds only moved the price further. If you also want to get BTC, here we explain what the advantages of investing through investment trust funds are. Bitcoin investment trust funds Before we dive in, we will explain what Bitcoin and Bitcoin investmenttrust funds are. Bitcoin is a completely virtual cryptocurrency that is used as a decentralized medium to exchange funds over a peer-to-peer blockchain network. Its value is based on the demand and supply in the market, and hence, as the demand is increasing on a global scale, the price is also rising. Bitcoin investment trust fund works like other investment trust funds. Generally, a crypto trust fund is a publicly listed financial institution that invests in financial assets on behalf of its investors. When youre investing in BTC through investment trust funds, you are essentially buying Bitcoins share. As an investor, you dont need to bother with researching about crypto or finding secure means of storage. All aspects of the trading and the storage of your funds are entrusted to the trust funds. Of course, that comes with a price based on the size of your investment and the politics of the crypto trust fund. For example, Grayscale Investment Trust, which is a well-known Bitcoin trust fund, charges an annual fee of 2% of the funds assets. In other words, this means if you have invested in 1 Bitcoin, over time, the value will decrease to 0.092 because there are fees associated with the services offered by the crypto trust fund. If you want to invest in BTC directly, there is an abundance of trading sites like Bitqs, for example, which is a top automated trading site. You can sign up for freeto find out more about the automated system, how it works, and how you can register on the site. Otherwise, the platform utilizes high-end AI technology which conducts all trading automatically for you. In terms of trading, the environment is fully safe and transparent, so you can rest assured that your data is safe here. Pros and cons of investment trust funds The main advantage is that it is much more convenient to invest through an investment trust fund, especially for institutional investors. For individual investors, it might be too expensive, especially if they want to make long-term investments. The main advantage is that the value of Bitcoin tends to rise in Bitcoin Trust Funds when the price of Bitcoin increases. For example, in 2018, the share of the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust was trading at a price of $7.95, which was over 20% higher than the general price of Bitcoin. But, whether the price of the shares declines or rises higher than the general price of Bitcoin it is mainly affected by the number of investors that are buying BTC through the fund. In other words, it is possible for a Bitcoin trust fund to sell shares at a price 42% higher than the current Bitcoins worth. But, when the price decreases, the trust might close with a much lower price than the value of Bitcoin. So, its up to you to make a cost-effective analysis when it comes to investing in BTC, whether through an online trading site or investment trust funds. Make sure to take into consideration the fees you will need to pay, the reputability of the institutions, and other factors that are relevant to your financial goals",https://www.techgenyz.com/2021/04/16/what-are-bitcoin-trust-funds-and-how-do-they-work/

Terms of the settlement, which included a monetary payment made by Cao to Tesla, were not disclosed. 16h ago China Joins U.S. as Engine of Global Recovery With Record Growth (Bloomberg) -- Chinas economy strengthened in the first quarter of the year as consumer spending rose more than expected, putting it on course to join the U.S. as twin engines for a global recovery in 2021.Gross domestic product climbed 18.3% in the first quarter from a year earlier, largely in line with the 18.5% predicted in a Bloomberg survey of economists, though that record-breaking figure was mainly due to comparisons with a year ago when much of the economy was shut due to coronavirus. Retail sales beat expectations while industrial output growth moderated.The latest data puts China on course to grow well above its annual target of more than 6%, supporting the view that China and the U.S., where economists predict 6.2% growth, will both outperform other major nations this year. Chinas recovery hasnt yet plateaued after it became the first major economy to contain the spread of coronavirus and return to growth, with GDP rising 0.6% in the first three months of 2021 from the previous quarter.How Much of Chinas GDP Was Made in America?: Daniel MossThe recovery last year was led by strong investment in real estate and infrastructure spurring demand for industrial goods, while overseas orders for medical goods and electronic devices fueled exports. Consumer spending had lagged, but the latest figures showed a turnaround. Retail sales growth was 6.3% in March when calculated on a two-year average growth basis -- which removes distortions created by last years lockdowns -- up sharply from the rates seen last year.We are seeing a bit more balanced recovery in the Chinese economy, Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS AG, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. That early pickup in construction industry is going to give way to more household consumption, she added. Consumer spending at restaurants and sales of discretionary goods such as jewelry, alcohol and tobacco led the growth of retail sales in March.The economy was also boosted by a jump in investment from overseas. Inbound investment into China rose almost 40% to $45 billion in the first three months of 2021, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce released Thursday. That was the highest for that period in comparable data back to 2002.Markets were choppy following the data release but ended the day little changed, with the benchmark CSI 300 Index paring an earlier loss of as much as 0.6% to finish up 0.35% for the day. The yield on benchmark 10-year sovereign debt fell slightly to 3.16%. The onshore yuan was unchanged on the day at 6.5226 per dollar.Broadening out the recovery remains a work in progress with growth in the first quarter still reliant on the property sector. Fixed-asset investment in real estate rose 7.6% on a two-year average growth basis and infrastructure spending increased roughly in-line with pre-pandemic rates. Quarterly steel production of 271 million tons suggests that annual output is on course to top 1 billion tons for the second year running.What Bloomberg Economics Says...The undershoot in GDP growth relative to expectations and lopsided nature of the recovery do not warrant any economy-wide shift in monetary policy, in our view.Looking forward, production is poised to start peaking, while demand should pick up further. This should add more balance in what looks to be a steady recovery ahead.Chang Shu, chief Asia economistFor full report, click hereAlthough Beijing has promised no sharp turns in monetary and fiscal support this year, some prominent economists have warned that premature tightening could still put the recovery at risk. The central bank has asked banks to curtail loan growth in coming months as it seeks to control credit to curb asset bubbles. Alongside the investment data, data showing home prices grew at the fastest pace in seven months in March will likely prompt more action by Chinese policy makers to rein in the sector.Considering the robust recovery, we certainly do not expect Beijing to step up easing measures, but it is also unlikely to make a sharp shift in its policy stance, Nomura economists led by Lu Ting wrote in a note. Authorities have learned lessons from a forceful deleveraging campaign in 2017-18, which led to bond defaults, a stock market selloff and weaker growth, they said.The statistics bureau said Friday inflation is expected to remain in a moderate range this year, and while rising commodity costs could boost domestic prices, theres no basis for prices in upstream sectors to rise significantly.The economy is far from overheating, said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd. The consumer sector doesnt have a solid basis for overheating, and I dont think the central bank will take a faster turn for monetary policy.Bloomberg Economics forecasts global GDP growth of 6.9% in 2021, rapid enough to bring output substantially back onto its pre-Covid path. Data released Thursday showed the U.S. economys comeback is firing on all cylinders, with retail sales exceeding pre-pandemic levels in all categories except restaurants. Production at U.S. factories increased in March by the most in eight months.China has rapidly accelerated its vaccination campaign over the past month in a move that should help bolster spending on services. A recovery in major economies fueled by vaccine roll-outs and the Biden administrations massive fiscal stimulus is expected to sustain rapid growth in Chinese exports this year.Economists have upgraded their forecasts for Chinas growth in recent days: Bloomberg Economics expects 9.3% expansion, ING Groep NV economist Iris Pang predicts 8.6% and Nomura sees 8.9%.We expect the economy to continue to gain momentum in the second quarter, with a rotation in terms of the drivers of growth compared to last year, said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics Ltd. in Hong Kong. Less generous fiscal and monetary policy will weigh on infrastructure and real estate investment, while improved profitability and confidence should buoy corporate investment and consumption.(Updates with foreign investme",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/07af453c-4d24-3b33-99ba-78d0a976d098/is-coinbase-on-your-wish.html

However,","0 Bitcoin is suddenly all over mainstream media, whetting the appetite of risk-taking investors interested in entering positions in cryptocurrencies However, what they dont understand is all the benefits that this emerging asset class and the underlying blockchain technology have to offer. Negative perceptions about cryptocurrencys use for crime continue to get in the way of widespread acceptance. And even if that barrier is broken, learning about the technology and even using it can be challenging or confusing at first. However, Euler.Tools, the worlds first real-time block explorer platform that intends to disrupt the crypto trading industry using interconnected data, could finally make learning crypto and blockchain easy. Heres how Euler.Tools is helping traders see and understand blockchain technology and market events all from one single platform. The Early Mathematical Origins Behind Euler.Tools The story of how Euler.Tools first began was a struggle. Founder Jorge de los Santos got into crypto trading after finding success in other markets, only to get totally liquidated. His fascination with where the money went from there fueled his passion for learning more about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The more he searched for concrete sources of information, Santos realized that the industry still faced many challenges. As Santos first began his ambitious project, developers were unfamiliar with blockchain, and there were still many misconceptions about the technology itself. Santos was inspired by mathematician Leonhard Euler, who created graph theory and solved The Seven Bridges of Knigsberg problem. Euler.Tools applies an old methodology to modern-day problems to find the most efficient bridges into blockchain understanding and adoption. The Right Tools To Build The Future Of Blockchain Solutions Crypto traders are armed to the teeth with various tools and data sources, including TradingView, DexTools, BitQuery, and much more. But to access all this information, either the trader needs to invest in dozens of monitors or needsa to visit website after website after website to get all the info they need. Education is even more challenging with regard to bringing new users into the space. In addition, what exists today is difficult to understand clearly. Euler.Tools is revolutionizing blockchain data and education with an all-in-one solution, bringing together crucial data feeds to make widespread crypto adoption a reality. Convenience is a significant barrier in cryptocurrencies today. By including everything from tax prep to data visualization tools for fundamental and technical analysis, the technology will finally be accessible enough to grow. How Euler.Tools Revolutionizes Traditional Oracle Solutions Euler.Tools is an oracle that checks every single contract, operation, blockchain, and more, aggregating all information into its innovative data bridge blockchain architecture.

The cloud service provider supports all operations to keep the infrastructure responsive and functional. Cloud-based blockchain services increase adoption of the blockchain technology across businesses. The concept of blockchain as a service (BaaS) is similar to software-as-a-service (SaaS). Small and medium businesses are keen for adopting the blockchain technology. However, its complexities and operation-level issues such as configuration and infrastructure aligning are difficult to manage, which is discouraging overall adoption of the blockchain technology. In order to overcome these issues, leading technology organizations and small startups have introduced a solution called Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) model for all blockchain technology users. The BaaS model sets up all external services required in setting up the blockchain technology and infrastructure for customers. BaaS supports handling of complex operations of the blockchain technology for customers and their businesses. Moreover, BaaS keeps the infrastructure ready and operational. It also supports activities such as bandwidth controlling, appropriate allocation of resources, hosting, and security from hacking attempts.

The money was valued at more than 10.8 million U.S. dollars at the time of sale. It was confiscated from a criminal who engaged in pornographic websites in 2017. The profits have been deposited into the South Korean treasury.","In March 2021, according to relevant news from ZB, the South Korean government sold a confiscated bitcoin. The money was valued at more than 10.8 million U.S. dollars at the time of sale. It was confiscated from a criminal who engaged in pornographic websites in 2017. The profits have been deposited into the South Korean treasury. In the inquiry of relevant information, it was found that the bitcoin was confiscated by the South Korean government from an unhealthy website operator named Ahn, with a total of 191.32333418 pieces. According to the relevant report of Yonhap in 2018, the South Korean procuratorate will hand over the proceeds from the sale of the bitcoin to the Ministry of finance.Onbid, an online property trading system owned by Kamco, is responsible for the auction of the bitcoin.In early 2018, the bitcoin was worth 28 million won, or about $28000, while the proceeds from the sale of the bitcoin in March 2021 exceeded $10 million. Bitcoin's ""a slap in the face"" behavior In the Internet era, people describe that they don't want something, but their bodies honestly accept it, which is called ""Zhenxiang"". In the relevant policies of some rights institutions on digital assets, ""Zhenxiang"" still applies. On the one hand, digital assets represented by bitcoin are inherently monetary, which has set the tone when Nakamoto founded bitcoin and bitcoin network.Blockchain itself is to solve the ""point-to-point"" non trust ""value exchange"" in the Internet. It is a trust based ""currency"" in the Internet. It is the unique ""currency"" attribute of bitcoin, rather than the decentralized mode of trust, that makes governments around the world very resistant to it.Because it has the property of currency, it may threaten the status of legal currency, and decentralization makes it impossible for the government to carry out thorough supervision over special currency. For example, the current Federal Reserve has been releasing more dollars to promote trade and stabilize the domestic economy.We need to know that currency is equivalent to the certificate of all the labor achievements of the people of the country endorsed by the authority.Only when the productivity is improved or the people's labor achievements are accumulated, can there be a reasonable space for issuing more money.Too much money or deliberately less money will lead to the rise or fall of prices, and the rise and fall of prices will ultimately be borne by all citizens of the country. The Fed's excessive ""throwing money"" behavior of issuing additional currency is not based on the economic growth and productivity improvement of the U.S. citizens, but purely printing money, which will inevitably lead to the dilution of the value of the U.S. dollar, and the diluted value of the U.S. dollar will also affect the original U.S. dollar.Then, all those who originally held dollars would suffer visible or invisible losses due to the Fed's over issuance of money. Only when the American people bear this kind of loss, can the government manage smoothly.However, if people generally no longer use US dollars but use bitcoin instead, they will not be able to issue additional bitcoin, nor will they be able to supervise and control the value of bitcoin. Under this situation, the U.S. authorities will not be able to obtain benefits from the additional issuance of bitcoin, and naturally they will no longer be able to carry out ""smooth governance"". Of course, the United States and the Federal Reserve are just one example, and the South Korean government is also considering the same. Therefore, the authority will hardly allow bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to flow into the market in large quantities without its full control.However, the value represented by digital assets is what these centralized institutions are not willing to give up. Therefore, there is the ""truth"" behavior of the South Korean government in the face of ""all kinds of bans"" on cryptocurrency, while selling the bitcoin to fill the Treasury. Opportunities behind Behind the sale of the bitcoin by the South Korean government is a thought-provoking problem, that is, from the perspective of centralized institutions, bitcoin and other digital assets are valuable, or more generally, valuable. Since the government can participate in the transaction of decentralized digital assets, it indirectly shows the applicability and cognitive breadth of digital assets.This represents that more and more government actions in the future will be inextricably linked with digital assets.The ""value"" of digital assets will also be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. As long as there is a ""consensus"" on behalf of the ""value"" of digital assets, it is precisely this common understanding of the ""value"" of digital assets that will make digital assets more widely used in everyone's life. Although some commentators believe that South Korea's selling of BTC will cause some fluctuations in the currency market and lead to a drop in the currency price.But in the long run, this is exactly the key to further enhance the value of bitcoin. At the same time, it is also the beginning of the real participation of digital assets in the circulation of social value. Almost predictably, there will be more and more digital asset transactions involving the government, and more and more digital asset transactions led by bitcoin will be put on the table.

Not AllDatais Equal While few believed the pandemic would dilute the growing strength and cadence of the ESG drumbeat, in fact, almost the opposite is true. The pandemic and economic circumstances of the past year have heightened a focus on the swift actions necessary to address climate change, sustainability and corporate purpose. Atop of the current landscape, President Bidenis applying heavy torque to the 2050target deadline cited by numerous companies, with the announcement of the administrations aggressive 10-year plan to urgently and dramatically cut GHG by 2030, shaving 20 years off of previous strategies. In tandem, the Securities and Exchange Commission as its new priority proclaiming the intersection of regulatory frameworks and investor information as critical to achieving progress. But there are a : Finding out which companies are necessarily on the right side can be difficult. The absence of a uniform set of guidelines or disclosures all firms are forced to release is whydataaround ESG is such a sticky subject. Blockchain = Truth + Trust An oft noted major challenge lies in consistent ESG reporting or score uniformity across variegated frameworks and standards such as theSustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)andGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI) withothers still being formed Talk of a uniform set of standards to garner apples to apples comparisons is increasing in focus. Yet this obstacle is a bit of a red herring: disparate score cards. Instead of such hefty focus on frameworks, bandwidth needs to go toward companies ability to capture real-time sustainabilitydatato then power environmental performance strategies. Proving traction against carbon-neutrality goals will require an external metric, yes, but most importantly will be reliant on technology that can generate accurate, auditable and accountable sustainability measurements, reporting and, thus, records to track against. The technology that will fulfill this pivotal role isblockchain. Much of blockchains power resides in its immutable distributed ledger technology , not in its much hyped crypto-token-mining iterations. When blockchain is deployed to automate transactions with smart contracts, the technology captures and aggregates operatingdataby tapping connected devices and other Internet of Things (IoT) information sources across commercial supply chains. It generates a record of truth that corroborates physical events and services in real-time and stores relevant, unalterabledataused toautomatetransactions. Applying blockchain to theESGdataissuelendsboth accountability and accessibility to companies looking to digest their true environmental impact and share records with authorized agencies, supporting the first-of-its-kind ability to reliably measure sustainabilitydatawith speed. Blockchain enables companies to collect and measure transparent ESG information that can publicly align their actions with their words. Gone are estimates, ushered in by bulletproof actualdatameasurements. Instead of promises to engage in better environmental practices, blockchain-backed smart contracts allow for a comprehensive deep dive into the true environmental impact of a companys full supply chain. Harvesting real-time information up and down a supply chain presents the unprecedented opportunity for companies to map against green goals and identify actions that can bring meaningful change to fruition, as well as adjust those that are not bearing out needed sustainability improvements. Truth and trust with blockchain will forge value chains out of supply chains. For investors, regulators and other parties, who greatly desire a new economy contingent upon real-time, verifiable sustainabilitydata, blockchain-enabled reporting will set a new bar for transparency as our country and world marches towarda more climate-friendly future. is founder and CEO of Houston-based Data Gumbo, a technology firm thatdeveloped an industrial smart contract networkpowered and secured by blockchain.

AFP Former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak's shocking admission of cricket corruption has also shone a light on cryptocurrency finding a place in the bookies' list of enticements -- a brand new challenge for the ICC's Anti-Corruption Unit, which claims to be ready for the battle. Streak was on Wednesday banned by the ICC for eight years after admitting to disclose inside information to a suspected Indian bookie during his coaching stints in Zimbabwe, Bangladesh as well as the IPL, Afghanistan Premier League and the Bangladesh Premier League. Till date, cash has been the most preferred mode of payment for bookies, who also pay in kind with cars, jewellery and high-end phones. However, Streak's case has thrown up the use of bitcoin in corrupt payments. The ICC's detailed judgement in the case has revealed that Streak once received two ""bitcoins"" from a corruptor in 2018, valued at $35,000 at that time. ""It is a new phenomenon for us, but we have staff capable of investigating it. Corrupters try to use all modes including cash and 'hawala', which are not easy to trace either. Bitcoins pose a similar challenge,"" ICC ACU General Manager Alex Marshall said in an email reply to PTI's query on Thursday. So what is cryptocurrency? In layman's language, ""Cryptocurrency"" is virtual money. It is the purchase of a digital asset based on an algorithm. The bitcoins that are generated aren't regulated by any central banking authority in any country (like the Reserve Bank of India) and in many countries like India, it is still an illegal tender. In simpler words, it is a ""Blockchain Industry"" where a financial transaction between two people sitting in two different parts of the world will not have any intermediaries. The valuation of one bitcoin is staggering. One bitcoin's INR value currently stands at Rs 46.83 lakh or $62,453. However, the bigger challenge is that coding of ""cryptocurrency"" is believed to be watertight. There are elaborately programmed vaults (digital) and the tracking can be infinitely more difficult when compared to paper tenders like INR, USD or GBP. Marshall said that ICC is up for the challenge in the coming days now that a new method of corruption has emerged. ""Tracking bitcoin transactions may not be easy but we have the right people with the right expertise, understanding and network needed to ensure we stay ahead of the corruptors,"" Marshall said. Even BCCI's new head of Anti Corruption Unit (ACU) Shabbir Hussain Shekhadam Khandwawala said that he heard of payment through bitcoins for the first time. ""Yes, I was going through the details of the Heath Streak case. I have also heard about bitcoin transaction for the first time,"" the former DGP of Gujarat Police told PTI. However, Hussain feels that tracking of corrupt people is not always about the keeping a vigil on the mode of transactions. ""We always catch the people not by the amount or how the money is paid (bitcoins in this case). Our clues are different. We keep a watch on them and their activities and telephonic calls,"" Hussain said. ""Some things happen underground also,"" he said, adding ""Everything has to be on the basis of the solid information received from sources. ""So if someone has accepted money or been involved in graft in any form, once you start investigation, you are able to reach that,"" he said. He, in fact, played down the prospect of cryptocurrency gaining ground in the world of cricket corruption. Promoted JioSaavn.com ""...well it's fine for the person in question to keep his money safely. It is like safe parking of money where no one can see it. But does it come in the way of investigation of this case? Perhaps not.""

For Bitcoin, the ""underground"" digital money system, it was a landmark year. In 2013, Bitcoin was crowned ""word of the year"" by the Australian National Dictionary Centre, it crossed the $1,200 threshold but halved in value in just a split second, it raised eyebrows among regulators and world-class economists, while its ""rebellious nature"" allured Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

Read on and find out how he did it.,"Joseph Ebuka , a Peer from Lagos City in Nigeria whos not only an active crypto trader and blockchain enthusiast but an art curator and freelancer as well. Instead of focusing on one thing to achieve his creative and financial goals, he brought together his love for art and Bitcoin (BTC) and made them work for him. Want to know how? Learn as Joseph shares how hes able to enjoy the best of both worlds. The beginning of his art journey Joseph started to have a keen interest in art when one of his friends shared rewarding opportunities with him. My love for art and the creative energy of the artists around me made me join the art business. We then decided to create a community of artists and creatives under a brand umbrella called Cokespice, he said. He started earning money from art when his group hosted their first traditional art exhibition in Abuja back in 2017. This exhibit became an avenue for featured local artists to showcase their incredible crafts, connect with art collectors, and make money from commissioned works. Ive just started my journey into the art collection and I have about four artworks in my gallery already. Right now, my most preferred medium of art is oil paintings on canvas, but Im also interested in graphics and pencil art, Joseph added. Navigating creative opportunities with Bitcoin It was only less than a year ago when Joseph started crypto trading. Hes using the Paxful mobile application to trade and manage his crypto funds anytime and anywhere. Since hes an active trader and his savings are mostly in crypto, Joseph found it easy to use Bitcoin in his freelance art business. But how smooth are crypto transactions on Paxful? He told us, It was a pretty swift process. My recent purchase was a physical painting, so I went to the artists studio. He also owns a Paxful Wallet, which made the transaction easier and faster. All I did was ask for his wallet address and send him my BTC payment. Since it was an internal transfer, I was charged with 0 fees and the artist received my payment instantly. According to Joseph, Bitcoin will add more value to both the art and the artist since they can withdraw money in the currency they prefer, and their artworks can be exchanged as a token for value. I actually buy artwork based on its perceived valueits not just a painting, its also an investment based on value exchange, he stated. Is blockchain the future of art? Joseph deems that blockchain technology can create a significant shift in the art world soon. I believe that blockchain is the future of art, and that future is now. Hes also looking forward to the growth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)digital tokens tied to unique tradable assetsin the African scene. Based on the recognition of talents and crafts, the art and paint industry in Nigeria has done well enough to be recognized. Im excited to see a major shift in the art industry in the near future, especially with the rise of crypto in the art market. Theres so much potential, he stated. Joseph also attends art auctions on Telegram, where he connects with international and local artists selling their works on blockchain platforms. He spreads the word about Bitcoin and blockchain technology with others who arent very familiar with it, whenever possible. Are you an art enthusiast with a passion for Bitcoin?

(Xinhua/Gil Cohen Magen) As North Koreais reportedly considering launching a sovereign digital currency while China is diving into blockchain, there are opportunities for the two countries to cooperate in the sector, experts and industry insiders said. A Chinese blockchain firm interviewed by the Global Times on Thursday showed interest in providing technology support and experience to contribute to the effort. Shentu Qingchun, CEO of Shenzhen-based blockchain company BankLedger, said the company is willing to invest in blockchain-related industries in North Korea if the country opens up the market. ""It's a good opportunity. China has an edge in developing blockchain technology while North Korea could offer resources and a legion of application scenarios. Cooperation with North Korean companies in the sector could fast track the process and help overcome North Korea's weak internet infrastructure,"" Shentu told the Global Times. He said his company can help apply blockchain in government administration as well as ticket sales and ticket checking. ""We could also help set up a cryptocurrency exchange in North Korea if the local regulators allowed us to do so,"" Shentu said. His firm has invested in a Malaysia-based digital currency trading center known as dfex.com. North Korea has been reportedly studied the launch of its own sovereign digital currency. As Businesskorea reported in April 2019, North Korea held a first-ever international event on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies from April 18 to 25. A 36-year-old cryptocurrency specialist, Virgil Griffith, was arrested by the US Department of Justice on November 28, for allegedly helping North Korea use blockchain technology in violation of US sanctions and develop plans to transfer cryptocurrency between North Korea and South Korea, industry website decrypt.co reported. Prosecutors alleged that he gave a presentation on how to use cryptocurrency during the conference, it said. ""The UN sanctions have not stipulated rules about blockchain and cryptocurrency so far,"" Zhang Huizhi, vice dean of the Northeast Asian Studies College at Jilin University, told the Global Times on Thursday. L Chao, a research fellow at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences in Shenyang, agreed. ""China and North Korea could cooperate on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency research to benefit each other. Especially for cryptocurrency, because it is an important step to enhance connectivity in finance,"" L said. He advised Chinese companies to be prudent and make tentative plans if they are interested in blockchain cooperation with North Korea. Li Min, a senior partner with Shanghai Hansheng Law Offices, noted that there are many uncertainties about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, including supervision, market access and future development in different countries.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-14 14:15:00,How Blockchain News Moved 3 Stocks Today -- The Motley Fool,Kodak and Cogint were down big while MoneyGram soared. Here's what investors need to know.,"was down 23.8% and Cogint ( NASDAQ:FLNT ) had dropped 10.5% as of 1:00 p.m. EST on blockchain-related events. Blockchain is the digital-ledger technology underlying many crytpocurrencies. Kodak and Cogint soared nearly 55% and 7%, respectively, on Wednesday -- though at one point, Cogint had climbed nearly 30% -- after both companies announced their own unique entrances into the blockchain industry. So it's not terribly surprising to see shares give back some of those gains. On the other hand, MoneyGram International is up thanks to a newly announced partnership with enterprise blockchain company Ripple. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Empowering the photography industry Essentially, nothing has changed with Kodak since yesterday, when it announced a partnership with blockchain developer WENN digital to launch a new image-rights management platform (dubbed KODAKOne) that will use blockchain technology. Kodak and WENN also introduced a new photo-centric cryptocurrency called KODAKCoin. Kodak hopes that the two new products will allow ""photographers and agencies to take greater control in image rights management,"" namely by enabling them to both archive and register new images that can be licensed, tracked, and paid for on the secure platform. ""For many in the tech industry, 'blockchain' and 'cryptocurrency' are hot buzzwords,"" explained Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke, ""but for photographers who've long struggled to assert control over their work and how it's used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem."" Kodak will hold an initial KODAKCoin offering to accredited investors at the end of this month. A new player in blockchain analytics Similarly, there have been no new negative developments for Cogint since it announced a new blockchain-solutions division on Wednesday, calling it ""Red Violet Blockchain and Analytical Solutions."" That said, the data-analytics platform provider appointed  LDJ Capital founder -- and blockchain and cryptocurrency expert -- David Drake as the chairman of the new division's strategic advisory board. However, that's not an unfavorable move that could explain today's drop. ""Red Violet's identity verification and Know Your Customer solutions, and analytical capabilities, have wide-ranging applications across the blockchain landscape and I look forward to driving Red Violet's expansion,"" Drake stated. Validation for a promising new cryptocurrency Finally, MoneyGram announced it will pilot the Ripple's XRP digital asset in its payment flows through Ripple's xRapid on-demand liquidity solution. Moneygram further noted that XRP is drastically more efficient than other cryptocurrencies ""with transaction fees of fractions of a penny"" compared to fees of $30 per transaction for Bitcoin. XRP's average transaction times are also significantly faster at two to three seconds compared to between 15 minutes to an hour for many other leading digital assets. MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes added: Every day blockchain technology is changing the norm and encouraging innovation. Ripple is at the forefront of blockchain technology and we look forward to piloting xRapid. We're hopeful it will increase efficiency and improve services to MoneyGram's customers. Now what It's unclear the extent to which any of the above products, developments, and partnerships will contribute to the top and bottom lines of Kodak, Cogint, or MoneyGram in the near future. I think investors would do well to tread carefully here, or better yet -- as Kodak and Cogint investors learned today -- to avoid the dangerous practice of trying to trade around blockchain-centric news. has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Press Releases  One News Page: Wednesday, 14 April 2021","Ethereum Mining and Blockchain Company TTM Digital Assets & Technologies Enters Into Triangular Reverse Merger With Sysorex Published 14 Apr 2021 Herndon, VA, April 14, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- Sysorex (OTCQB: SYSX) today announced the closing of a reverse triangular merger with TTM Digital Assets & Technologies, Inc., a data center owner and operator and now, the largest U.S. publicly traded Ethereum mining company based in the United States with operations in New York and North Carolina.As a result of the transaction, TTMs business and operations will become the core business of Sysorex as the first Ethereum company trading in the U.S. public markets.  Sysorex will continue to operate its legacy business providing a comprehensive suite of network performance, secure wireless access and cybersecurity products to the U.S. Government through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sysorex Government Services, Inc. TTM, a pioneer in the Ethereum mining sector, operating since 2017, has been profitable since inception.  Prior to the Merger, TTM mined and distributed Ethereum to management and its investors that if held by those investors would be valued at approximately $35,000,000 at todays Ether (ETH) price of approximately $2,325. TTM owns and operates more than 12,000 NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs), including a large number of specialized Cryptocurrency Mining Processors. These GPUs are currently online and securing the Ethereum blockchain and generating ETH around the clock with industry leading efficiency. By the Merger, the shareholders of TTM exchanged 100% of TTMs share capital for Sysorexs agreement to issue 124,218,268 shares of Sysorex common stock to the TTM shareholders, which will represent 80% of the total share capital of Sysorex.  As a closing condition to the Merger, a significant portion of the Companys existing debtholders, creditors and service providers agreed to convert or exchange their outstanding indebtedness or accounts payable, as applicable, eliminating at least $13,500,000 of Sysorex debt, substantially improving Sysorexs balance sheet and significantly increasing Sysorex shareholders equity. Wayne Wasserberg, an executive with more than 15 years of experience working with clients internationally across industries including Forex trading, alternative assets, infrastructure and real estate development has been elected CEO of TTM, replacing Zaman Khan who will remain on the Board and will continue as the President of SGS. Commenting on the transaction, Mr. Wasserberg stated, TTMs management team draws experience from multiple industries including crypto-centric development stage businesses, engineering and capital markets who recognized the power and flexibility of the Ethereum blockchain soon after its introduction.  The team smartly invested in data center infrastructure shortly after formation and from the outset recognized the importance of owning and operating its cryptocurrency mining infrastructure. Mr. Wasserberg continued, The historical strategy was to operate TTM similar to an investment fund distributing mined ETH to its investors.  Given the expanded opportunity set presented by Ethereum today including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), development of apps and peer-to-peer financial transactions, and the expectation that future upgrades to the Ethereum network will make Ethereum more scalable, and to further enhance security to support 1,000s of transactions per second, TTM has shifted its strategy to amassing Ethereum in our corporate treasury, providing public shareholders exposure to this asset class as we also expand our platform to unlock value for our new shareholders based on the latest opportunities provided by Ethereum as we position for the exciting future of Ethereum and our business. Given our strong position within the cryptocurrency industry and deep relationships with the leading manufactures of GPUs and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), we can expand to the mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the future. However, our current mindset is that Ethereum holds several advantages over Bitcoin.  Unlike Bitcoin, which as it has matured, has maintained a conservative stance on technological progress and blockchain usage, Ethereum has embraced progress in on-chain usage allowing for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and explosive growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) as programmable money. Given this divergence of approach, we were not surprised last month to see Visa become the first major legacy transaction service provider to settle transactions on top of the Ethereum blockchain. We believe the Merger with Sysorex provides our combined company with certain strategic opportunities that we have identified given Sysorexs relationship with the U.S. Government and the recently announced $2 trillion-plus infrastructure plan and we look forward to exploring new business with SGS.  We also see large opportunities around Ethereums flexible network that allows users to build and launch NFTs on top of the framework, which can also be stored on the network, and we are interested in exploring optimization of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning and quick image rending in partnership with our significant stakeholder, CoreWeave, Inc. The Merger was structured as and is intended to constitute a tax-free exchange pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(A) and Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. For additional details on the Merger, please reference our current report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Please visit our TTM Website for more information.

cmcmarkets,NotProvided,2021-04-14 12:12:09,Investors make a beeline for HIVE Blockchains share price,HIVE Blockchain Technologies released a positive financial update at the start of April that sent its share price flying.,"solar O n 8 April, HIVE Blockchain Technologies [HIVE.V]share price climbed 2.6% after it announced that its cryptocurrency assets had jumped 300% in value during the first quarter of 2021. Before the blockchain company published its fiscal year-end coin holdings on 7 April, the stock had soared 105.4% to CA$4.91 during the first three months of the year. HIVE Chart by TradingView Shares in the Vancouver-based cryptocurrency miner had been relatively flat throughout January. However, the stock was boosted by a six-day winning streak the next month that saw it hit an intraday high of CA$7.25 on 19 February before closing at CA$6.80. The stock was up 110% for the year to 13 April, outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Harvest Portfolios Blockchain Technologies ETF [HBLK.TO]. HIVE Blockchain had a 2% weighting in the Blockchain Technologies fund as of 31 March. It was also held by the Horizons Big Data & Hardware Index ETF [HBGD.TO], with a 3.96% weighting as of 12 April. The ETF was up 65.45% for the year to 13 Aprils close. Bitcoin and Ethereum rally key to asset boost On 7 April, HIVE Blockchain revealed that its coin inventory value had soared by 300% from $15m on 31 December 2020 to $60m on 31 March. The value of the companys digital currency holdings climbed 85.7% quarter-over-quarter from $3.5m to $6.5m in the first quarter of 2020 and a further 64.6% to $10.7m in the second quarter. By the end of the fourth quarter, the company had more than 320 Bitcoins and 20,030 Ethereum coins held in its cold (offline) wallets. The recent rally in cryptocurrencies was a major driver in increasing the dollar value of HIVE Blockchains coin portfolio. The price of Bitcoin against the US dollar rallied 825.8% in the last 12 months, from $6,859 to $63,503.46 on 13 April. Meanwhile, the price of Ethereum against the dollar jumped by an astronomical 1,263.7% in the past year to $2,157.66 from just $158.22. 1263.7 % Ethereum's 12-month jump against the dollar Frank Holmes, chief executive of HIVE Blockchain, said that the growth in Ethereum and decentralised finance was a significant part of boosting its coin asset value. Its also why investors were attracted to the stock. HIVE has become a proxy for Bitcoin and Ethereum, he told Opto. If Bitcoin and Ethereum prices continue to trade at such high multiples, Holmes believes the company could double in valuation from here. He is also looking at a potential Nasdaq listing by the end of the year, following the success of companies like Riot Blockchain [RIOT] and Marathon Digital Holdings [MARA] Given that HIVE Blockchain was one of the most liquid stocks in Canada last year  with 1.7 billion shares traded  Holmes believes that it could fetch a higher valuation compared to its peers based on its improving revenue and cash flow. Next-generation mining equipment The positive results meant Hive Blockchain had $36m in cash by the end of 31 March, a 3,500% increase from the $1m it had in the previous quarter, which it will continue to use to invest in mining hardware. HIVE Blockchain said it would look to continue investing in ASIC and GPU next-generation mining equipment, which is set to boost its gross mining margins. The company forecast revenue to triple over the next year based on current Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Our strategy is to continue holding coins, as we feel that it will benefit our shareholders, Holmes said in a statement. ""Our strategy is to continue holding coins - Frank Holmes, HIVE Blockchain chief executive Brian Paradza, a chartered financial analyst, believed the company could easily follow through with its strategy based on its improved cash position, he wrote in The Motley Fool. However, Paradza also believed that it could have reported much more coin inventory if it had held onto some previously mined Ethereum coins that it sold during the quarter. If the company produced anywhere near the 21,500 Ether and 165 Bitcoin coins produced during a previous quarter, then the total coin portfolio should have grown to something between 33,200 and 34,700 Ethereum coins, and nearly 347 Bitcoins, he said, adding that sales could explain the difference during the period. A digital gold rush HIVE Blockchains strategy pivot to focus on building its coin inventory was received positively by the market. While he expects that the Vancouver-based companys shares will be subject to some price swings in the short term, Bruce Campbell, president and portfolio manager at StoneCastle Investment Management, predicts that increased digital currency adoption and higher Bitcoin prices will drive its shares higher in the long term. Bitcoin bullishness is also seen at JPMorgan: Considering how big the financial investment into gold is, any such crowding out of gold as an alternative currency implies big upside for Bitcoin over the long term, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, MD at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients seen by Forbes. JPMorgan is targeting a Bitcoin price of $130,000 in the long-term if it continues to converge with gold. If this were to occur, then it could stand to benefit cryptocurrency miners like Hive Blockchain considerably. Continue reading for FREE Success! You have successfully signed up.

April 14, 2021 | Written by: Categorized: Banking and financial markets| Blockchain explained| Blockchain in financial services Share this post: How can businessesabsorb disruptive impact and begin to integrate these new business models in existing and new streams of business opportunity? NFTs have taken the world by storm. Rejuvenating the blockchainmovement started by Bitcoin, followed by smart contract platform Ethereum, NFTs seem to be a natural progression in the explosion of asset tokenization, of all kinds of things we value. NFT stands for non-fungible token and to understand NFT we need to understand the concept of fungibility! What is an NFT? An asset is considered fungible when it is considered mutually interchangeable with another identical item. For instance, money which can be changed for other forms and modality or other purposes. In the crypto-sphere, most native assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum serve the same function, besides its core purpose or providing utility they are also fungible tokens. By this definition non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, invert the definition of fungibility and provide a unique perspective of other things that are also as valuable to us as money and can be measured in fungible units. See how blockchain adds value to trade and finance NFTs solve the issue of uniqueness and a one-of-a-kind asset type. Examples include not only the popular collectable such as digital art, music, and other digital collectibles  which we value and treasure  but can also include other practical objects such as digital IDs, healthcare records, credit history and others, which are unique, valuable to us, and serve a purpose in digital networks powered by blockchain So, while blockchain is the underlying technology that provides a transaction system by enforcing a digital ledger and enforces rules of engagement via smart contracts it also extended tenets such as immutability, transaction record and transparency to facilitate verification and asset movement with an embedded trust system. What can NFTs be used for? NFTs are also a type of token and asset class online  other tokenized assets can include stable coin, security tokens, tokenized securities and others. NFTs are unique in that they can be tradable (art and collectibles) or hypothecated (healthcare records or digital history) and this is where things get interesting. As NFTs are also things of value and make their way into marketplaces they need a fungible token like a utility coin or stable coin for derivation of value in measurable terms. These marketplaces will usually need integration with either banking rails or existing crypto-provided rails such as digital exchanges or a DeFi ecosystem to facilitate trade and transfer. I address the complex issue of a fleeting and rapid rise of NFTs, after a similar meteoric phased rise of decentralized finance(DeFi), creating amazing innovations with the immense promise of democratization, new business models, and global marketplaces with global access  all fueled by the basic premise of decentralization and fundamental constructs of tokenization and wallets. NFTs may be characterized as unique one-of-a-kind cryptographic tokens with some intrinsic value to the holder (ID, health record) or a market (art, collectible). Where are NFTs going next? NFTs that have an intrinsic value and are essentially tokens that are simple proof-validations of the existence, authenticity, and ownership of digital assets. Fungible tokens are valued on various bases, such as the sum total of economic activity in the network (cryptocurrency), utility (smart contracts and transaction network processing), assigned values (as in stable coins and security tokens), and so on. NFTs represent both transferable entities and non-transferable tokens that we value. We begin to realize the promise of blockchain that envisioned digitization, tokenization and democratization of finance by enabling networks that are capable of moving value with reduced friction and intermediation. The question to ponder now is: how do businesses, individuals and enterprises understand the transformative and disruptive impact and begin to integrate these new business models into existing and new streams of business opportunity?

Thus, it is very much possible that in the near future, BTCs market cap will surpass that of other mainstream assets as well, given it has already sped past that of Tesla. Another research report by Glassnode, a blockchain data provider, said that bitcoin has held the $1 trillion market cap for more than a week. Therefore, it displays a strong vote of confidence for bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency asset class as a whole. It is important to note that bitcoin, at the beginning of 2021, had a more modest market cap of only $500 billion, but from thereon, it went to gain another $500 billion. Advertisements So, which were the key events that contributed to BTCs viral growth? Both Elon Muskand Jack Dorseymade sizable investments in bitcoin via Tesla and Square. Teslas 1.5 billion bitcoin investment is pegged to have reaped the company bigger profits than what it earned from its entire business in 2020. Canadian government regulators approvedmultiple bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds, aka ETF. Several ETFs were launched on the Toronto Stock Exchange, aka TSX. For many years, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBT) was the only investment vehicle accessible to investors. Last but not least, major payment processors such as MasterCardand Visa along with Bank of New York Mellon, made announcements about making it easier for their customers to use cryptocurrencies for making purchases. The skyrocketing value of Bitcoin has boosted the confidence of investors as well as traders despite possible backslash it may face in some of the largest markets. India, one of the largest markets, is reportedlylevying a heavy tax on Bitcoin exchanges and trading as well. Few either countries are also closely monitoring the market conditions before making their final move. It now remains to be seen how further and at what speed bitcoins market cap grows from here onward. We will keep you updated. Until then, stay tuned.

Another event headliner, MicroStrategy MSTR CEO Michael Saylor, pointed out that the result is mic-drop-worthy: We went from zero adoption in the world to 26% enthusiasm in less than 12 months, he says. But despite the galloping interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from both institutional and retail investors, Schulman said PayPal, is one large company that is unlikely to put bitcoin on its balance sheet this year, citing volatility concerns from investors. On the flipside, Saylor noted on a separate panel that everybody talks about the volatility of bitcoin, but volatility measures the rate at which it's going up in price. It's the same as buying the volatility of Tom Brady. He's got the highest volatility in the Football League, LeBron James has high volatility in the basketball league. The winner of every single sport and the winning team of everything on Earth is always the most volatile by definition because it's the one that's winning most often, added Saylor. Since August 11, 2020, when MicroStrategy revealed its first bitcoin purchase worth $250 million, the software company has bought $2.2 billion in bitcoin, more than any other publicly traded company in the world. Its stock has soared 534.3%over the past 12 months, while bitcoin has gained 817.5% and the S&P 500 has added 49.6% over the same period. Most of the event discussions centered around bitcoin and the ever-rising wave of institutional bitcoin mania, with comments from Fidelity, Northern Trust NTRS , and CME Group CME . Yet alternative cryptocurrencies and blockchains were also mentioned. Visa's head of crypto Cuy Sheffield said the credit card giant ultimately wants to support new types of cryptocurrencies and protocols and find ways to integrate them into Visas core network. Last month, the company started accepting settlement payments from its global cryptocurrency wallet partner Crypto.com in stablecoin USDC on the ethereum blockchain. Beyond cryptocurrencies, executives from Walmart Global Tech, luxury powerhouse LVMH, South Africa-based pulp producer Sappi and partner of Russias leading mining and smelting producer Nornickel, Atomyze, discussed applications of distributed ledger technology in supply chain tracking and fraud prevention. The two-hour event concluded with a panel discussion with DTCC and Vanguards blockchain bosses showing how the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the process of merging the two worlds of enterprise blockchain, which traditionally doesnt use cryptocurrency, with the growing digital asset space. John Evans, head of blockchain strategy at Vanguard, said: With the net effect of everything that occurred in markets between the beginning of the lockdown and maybe the fourth quarter, I think that all of the mindset that needed to shift definitely at all levels of these large financial services organizations finally coalesced.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-14 07:39:46,Where Will Bitcoin and Blockchain Fit in the Banking System in 25 Years? -- The Motley Fool,One of these may have a brighter future than the other.,") Jun 27, 2018 at 10:45AM Will bitcoin truly become the currency of the world? Will blockchain technology be used in our everyday lives? host Michael Douglass and Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel think the answer is ""yes,"" but only to one of these two questions. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on June 25, 2018. Michael Douglass: Let's start with blockchain. I believe that blockchain will be in widespread use for its dispersed ledger capabilities. I will further add, I do not think that Fannie and Freddie will be using blockchain for mortgages because I think they're going to lag the rest of the market. But, I'm betting that, throughout the private sector, blockchain will be used for contracts, and maybe even some non-agency conforming loans might be using blockchain for validation. Matt Frankel: There are a ton of applications for blockchain technology. We're only starting to see this pick up a little bit. One important distinction I want to make -- and we're going to get into this in a little more detail in a minute -- blockchain does not mean Bitcoin. Blockchain does not mean any other cryptocurrency. This is a form of technology. It's just like saying, ""The internet does not mean Microsoft."" It's one thing that came out of internet technology. Blockchain technology, I definitely agree with Michael on this one, is going to grow by leaps and bounds. There are so many applications, not only in finance but in fields like healthcare, for example. There are a ton of applications for blockchain in terms of record-keeping and things like that. I definitely agree with you on that one. Douglass: Here's the one that, I don't think it's going to be too controversial between you and me, Matt, but it might be for some of our listeners -- I do not believe that any of the current major cryptocurrencies will be in widespread use for conducting business transactions. There, I said it! They are too resource-intensive, they're just too slow, and they can't handle the volume. Now, that's not to say that they won't be used as validation. Again, I think blockchain will be. But, I don't think we're going to be regularly paying the pizza delivery guy with Bitcoin. Now, I do believe that new cryptocurrencies will emerge and may, in fact -- and probably will -- better solve the speed and cost difficulties that would plague today's cryptos at scale. But, I do not believe that any of our current -- you might think of them as first or second-generation -- cryptos will be in widespread, common use across society. Frankel: Just to add a little more color to that, when Michael says the major cryptocurrencies, I believe you're referring to, what, the biggest dozen or two dozen that exist right now? Douglass: Yeah, exactly. Frankel: OK. There are 1,900 cryptocurrencies in counting right now. Douglass: [laughs] Right! Frankel: And there are more coming online every day. It's possible that the ones that will eventually have a big impact have already been invented. There's already third-generation cryptocurrencies being invented. But it's way too early to tell. Who knows which one of the 1,900 could eventually become what everyone thinks Bitcoin is going to become? There's no way of knowing right now. Will cryptocurrency still be a thing in the future? Absolutely. It could definitely one day -- probably not in the next 25 years -- completely replace our currency system as we know it. Will it be Bitcoin itself that does it? Probably not. And that's kind of the point there. It is interesting to note, though, that a lot of those 1,900 cryptocurrencies utilize Bitcoin and Ethereum and the other blockchains in their technology. That's an interesting dynamic. But, will Bitcoin itself be as big as everyone thinks it's going to be in 25 years? I'm predicting no.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-14 07:38:00,The 1 Thing Everyone Overlooks With Blockchain Technology -- The Motley Fool,Forget this and your cryptocurrency investments could go up in smoke.,") Jan 19, 2018 at 9:21AM With few exceptions, the cryptocurrency market has been next to unstoppable since 2017 began. Though virtual currencies are exceptionally volatile, they've increased in value by roughly 3,900% to $703 billion between Dec. 31, 2016, and Jan. 15, 2018. Good luck finding any asset class that'll deliver similar returns in such a short period of time. Blockchain technology takes center stage Although there's a plethora of catalysts responsible for this rally in cryptocurrencies, including emotions, a weaker dollar, and an ""unfair"" market that tends to incentivize buying rather than selling, it's the emergence of blockchain technologythat has deserved most of the credit. Image source: Getty Images. In its simplest form, blockchain technology is the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that underpins virtual currencies and is responsible for recording all transactions without the need for a third party. Its invention, and the reason blockchain went mainstream via bitcoin and now other cryptocurrencies, is to correct a number of perceived issues with the current payment system. With today's banking system, transactions fees are believed to be higher than they should be as a result of banks acting as intermediaries during transactions. Furthermore, transaction settlement times, especially for cross-border transactions, are viewed as inadequate. If a payment is sent to an overseas bank, it can take between three to five days for that payment to be validated. Blockchain developers and some consumers simply feel this isn't efficient. Blockchain helps resolve these three primary payment system flaws Blockchain aims to resolve the three biggest issueswith the current banking systems. First, payments processed over blockchain have no intermediary involvement, meaning with fewer mouths to feed, so to speak, transaction costs should be lower. Image source: Getty Images. Second, transactions speeds are considerably quicker when processed through blockchain. Ripple claims that its transactions can settle in around four seconds, with others, such as Stellar, claiming processing times of two to five seconds. Imagine cutting a cross-border transaction that used to take days to clear down to a mere matter of seconds. Finally, blockchain is decentralized, meaning there's no one party that maintains majority control. It also means that cybercriminals won't be able to attack a single data center in order to bring a cryptocurrency to its knees, making blockchain a potentially safer choice than current payment networks. It's about much more than the financial services industry We're already witnessing a number of partnerships where blockchain technology is being deployed. IBM ( NYSE:IBM ) , for instance, has been among the first adopters of blockchain technology for payment processing. It announced a partnership with Stellarin October to utilize its blockchain technology in a dozen banks in the South Pacific region. The idea being that IBM generates tens of billions of dollars from overseas customers, and that the payments it receives from these customers in different types of currencies can take days to settle. When processed through Stellar's blockchain, these payments settle almost instantly. Image source: Getty Images. Additionally, we're witnessing companies develop their own proprietary blockchains. In late August, six global banks, including Barclays and Credit Suisse, decided to band together to create their own virtual ""utility settlement coin"" and accompanying blockchain technology. It's worth noting that we're also moving beyond the mindset that blockchain is a currency-only application. Dow Jones Industrial Average component Cisco Systems ( NASDAQ:CSCO ) , one of 200 organizations that are currently part of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, is testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain technology in some capacity. The company is also developing its own blockchain to identify different connected devices, monitor those devices, and evaluate how trustworthy those devices are when connected to a network. In other words, it's adapted blockchain to the Internet of Things The one thing everyone is overlooking with blockchain However, there's one pretty glaring issue that most folks and investors are completely overlooking when it comes to blockchain: It's been around for roughly a decade and is only now being tested in demo and small-scale projects. Image source: Getty Images. Cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Ethereum are sporting market caps of $62 billion and $121 billion, respectively, because enterprise customers have jumped at the chance to test their blockchain technology. But the key word there is ""test."" With the exception of IBM's Stellar partnership and Ripple's partnerships with American Express, Banco Santander, and MoneyGram International, there are very few real-world tests of blockchain currently ongoing. What this suggests is that it's going to take a long time before we see any significant adoption of blockchain in financial service and technology-based industries. This isn't to say that there isn't a future for blockchain, so much as that there are obstacles still to deal with regarding its implementation. For instance, one of the biggest objections that blockchain developers are liable to encounter is that blockchain isn't particularly compatible with current payment network infrastructure. This means having to almost start from scratch, which is a time-consuming and expensive project. It's something that enterprises are unlikely to undertake until there's certainty that blockchain can be scaled to handle the sheer amount of transactions that current financial networks are processing. Another problem is that the barrier to entry among cryptocurrencies is exceptionally low. We've been witnessing between 50 and 100 new virtual currencies hitting the market every month, each of which likely has its own proprietary blockchain. It's quite possible that today's most revered blockchains could become yesterday's news, and no businesses want to be stuck with inferior technology. Investors have a history of overestimating the swiftness of adopting new technology, and blockchain could simply be the latest technology to be added to this list has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Founded in 2014 by Joe Lubin one of the co-founders of Ethereum, ConsenSys has had a presence locally since 2018. Ethereum is a community-run technology powering ether (ETH), the worlds most popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin, as well as thousands of decentralised applications. ConsenSys said it currently has 50 roles open for Dublin with plans for a further 50 later this year. The company underwent a major restructuring last year to separate its core software business from its investment activities arm. It also acquired JPMorgans marquee blockchain unit, Quorum with the bank making a strategic investment in ConsenSys as part of the deal. ConsenSys said it intends to use the new financing to accelerate the convergence of decentralised finance (DeFi) and Web3 applications on Ethereum with enterprise blockchain infrastructure. Other investors who participated in the latest funding round included blockchain companies Protocol Labs the Maker Foundation, Fenbushi and The LAO. We are proud to partner with preeminent financial firms alongside leading crypto companies to further converge the centralised and decentralised financial domains at this particularly exciting time of growth for ConsenSys and the entire industry, said Mr Lubin. In addition to its local operation, W3BCloud, a joint venture between ConsenSys and chip maker AMD, is headquartered in Dublin. W3BCloud, which raised $20.5 million last year at launch, is focused on rolling out a network of decentralised data centres globally.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-13 22:38:13,5 Factors That Could Cause Bitcoin's Bubble to Burst -- The Motley Fool,"After more than quadrupling year to date, bitcoin's fun in the sun may be running out.",") Sep 14, 2017 at 8:38AM Traditionally, no investment has been able to hold a candle to the stock market when it comes to real wealth creation. However, cryptocurrencies aren't your traditional investment. This year alone, the aggregate market value of cryptocurrencies has soared by more than 800% surpassing $160 billion at one point, with bitcoin, the most consumer- and investor-facing digital currency of the group, nearly touching $5,000 per coin at the beginning of September after beginning the year below $1,000 a coin. While bitcoin's near quintupling might seem impressive, other cryptocurrencies, like primary rival ethereum, have risen by more than 3,500% year to date. Image source: Getty Images. Why digital currencies have been unstoppable in 2017 What's lit a fire under cryptocurrencies in 2017? Potentially the biggest catalyst has been the plummeting U.S. dollar, which recently hit a two-and-a-half year low. Generally, the dollar falls when uncertainty rises with regard to the U.S. economy. A lack of progress from the Trump administration in getting major legislation passed clearly has investors concerned that U.S. GDP growth forecasts may be a bit overzealous. When the dollar falls, the usual response from investors is to seek the safety of gold. Gold has been used as a currency for centuries, and it's a finite resource, which allows it to be a presumed store of value when the dollar is falling. However, in recent months, we've likely seen some investors choosing bitcoin as opposed to gold as their safe-haven investment. Bitcoin's protocol limits the number of coins that can be mined to 21 million, which itself makes bitcoin somewhat of a finite resource. The blockchain that a number of cryptocurrencies are based on, including bitcoin, could be another fundamental reason for this ferocious rally. Blockchain is a digital decentralized ledger that keeps track of all transactions. It's considered to be exceptionally secure, and some pundits believe it could be the future of peer-to-peer, client-to-business, and business-to-business transactions. In fact, more than 150 organizationsare currently testing versions of ethereum's blockchain in various pilot and small-scale programs in the financial and energy sectors, to name a few. Image source: Getty Images. If the bitcoin bubble bursts, one of these factors will likely be the culprit While the run higher in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has been game-changing, it's also feasible that bitcoin could be in bubble territory. After all, bitcoin's market cap has surged from roughly $3 billion in 2015 to nearly $69 billion as of Sept. 9, 2017. Though it's impossible to pinpoint what, if anything, could cause bitcoin's bubble to burst, the following five factors appear to be its most likely downside catalysts. 1. The emotional trading tide turns Perhaps the biggest risk for bitcoin is that the upside momentum wanes among retail investors and they lock in their gains. Because bitcoin is considered a nontraditional asset, most institutional investors have avoided taking a position in the digital currency. Thus, retail investors have been determining bitcoin's price -- and retail investors are considerably more prone to make decisions based on emotions rather than logic. It wouldn't take much to strike fear into bitcoin investors and send them scurrying for the exit. 2. Brand-name businesses ditch digital currencies, including bitcoin Another way bitcoin's bubble could burst is if brand-name and high-profile businesses suddenly decide that they don't want to accept the digital currency. Five brand-name businesses have accepted bitcoin since 2014 but if volatility in the currency grows, or if bitcoin's price were to suddenly falter, it's not out of the question that businesses could stop accepting bitcoin altogether. The fact that dozens of businesses accept bitcoin as payment adds to its legitimacy, so if businesses were to renege on their pledge to accept bitcoin, it could devastate what's often been described as a libertarian's dream currency. Image source: Getty Images. 3. Bitcoin's blockchain loses out to a competitor The bitcoin bubble could also burst if its blockchain turns out to be far less popular than envisioned by investors. As noted, ethereum already has an alliance of more than 150 organizations that believe its blockchain could be the next big thing. For what it's worth, bitcoin recently completed its SegWit2X upgrade that's designed to reduce transaction fees, improve transaction speeds, and increase capacity within its network (this upgrade is what precipitated the split of bitcoin into two currencies bitcoin and bitcoin cash). Will that be enough to attract businesses? It remains to be seen. 4. Bitfinex is hit by a major cyberattack If the largest bitcoin exchange were hit by a cyberattack, bitcoin could be in deep trouble. Currently, that title goes to Bitfinex, which, according to trading volume data found on WorldCoinIndex.com, shows it handles about half of all of bitcoin's volume in a given day. For those who may not recall, Mt. Gox at one time handled about 70% of bitcoin's trading volume before a cyberattack completely decimated the exchange. After bitcoin and cash were allegedly stolen by hackers, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy. This doesn't in any way suggest that Bitfinex is susceptible to cyberattacks to the same extent Mt. Gox was, but a debilitating cyberattack on Bitfinex, which could seriously hurt bitcoin's liquidity, can't be discounted. Image source: Getty Images. 5. Regulators crack down on bitcoin Finally, it's always possible that increased regulatory action could cause bitcoin's price to plunge. Unlike the other factors, this last point could potentially be a double-edged sword. You could rightly argue that increased regulation is a good thing since it would validate bitcoin as a currency and help keep bad folks from tarnishing the digital currency's reputation. Then again, increased regulation would be a major blow to libertarians who want zero government involvement in bitcoin. In other words, it could reduce interest in bitcoin, thus hurting its price. As noted, it's impossible to know with certainty if bitcoin is in a bubble. However, if my arm were twisted, I would indeed suggest the criteria for a bubble exists, and that buyers of bitcoin be fully aware of the major risks they're taking.

You might have lots of rumours about the lack of security and growing bitcoin price fluctuations with each passing day. Well, you are not the first person who has many misconceptions about bitcoin. Since bitcoin is the latest discovery, it is quite normal for people to have misconceptions about these digital currencies. You dont need to worry, as this article will help you in getting rid of some of the common misconceptions about bitcoins. With the rise in the popularity of bitcoins, misconceptions are also at an all-time high. If you want to make an investment in bitcoins, it is highly important to get rid of these misconceptions. One can invest in bitcoins using So, are you ready to get rid of these misconceptions? Bitcoins and anonymity Well, if people tell you that bitcoins are completely anonymous, you dont need to trust them. It may seem that bitcoins are anonymous when you use them initially, but you need to be very clear that bitcoins are not 100% anonymous. The blockchain technology that runs the bitcoin is made on a public network. Thus, anyone can know the transactions that you are making in bitcoin. If a person has deep knowledge and understanding, he/she can decode your spending and income in bitcoin. Thus, frankly speaking, bitcoins are pseudo-anonymous. This means that is it not 100% anonymous, but it offers high levels of anonymity as compared to the use of traditional currencies. The bitcoin system is made private, and thus, it can be quite difficult for an observer to know exactly what you are doing with bitcoins. But, as per many studies, it is being said that the future innovation in technology and upgradation in bitcoin technology can make it quite difficult for anyone to get even a single detail about the use of bitcoins. Is bitcoin a scam? Well, this is one of the biggest misconceptions about bitcoins. Every day, you may hear that bitcoin is a scam, and you should not make an investment. No doubt, many people are duped on the pretext of making an investment in bitcoins. But, if you pay close attention and if you keep your eyes and ears open, you will know that bitcoin is not a scam. Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not controlled by anyone. Many people called bitcoin to be a new type of pyramid scheme. But, there is no truth in all these versions. As a currency, bitcoin works in the same way as other currencies, and its just that it uses a digital format of usage and investment. There are certain loopholes associated with bitcoins, but it does not mean that bitcoin is a total scam. Bitcoin has been in the news for all wrong reasons, but you cant call it a scam. You need to be aware of the scams that people carry on in the name of bitcoin so that you dont get duped. Some of the major activities that you need to be aware of include phishing, social engineering, and different types of hacking. If someone is giving you totally different information about bitcoin, like you will be a millionaire in a single day, you dont need to respond to all these policies. Never give away your private bitcoin wallet keys to anyone you dont know. If you will keep your eyes and ears open, there is no way possible that bitcoin will feel like a scam to you. Bitcoin and the encryption This is the most common misconception related to bitcoins. You should be very clear that bitcoin doesnt use any type of encryption. Every peer-to-peer network needs to know and understand the transaction, and they have to make sure that the transactions are real. Thus, get rid of the information that says that bitcoins use encryption. Bitcoin works by using digital signature and hash functions. No doubt, some signatures use the encryption method. But, this does not mean that bitcoins are encrypted. With the arrival of new technology like bitcoin, it can be quite normal for people to have certain misconceptions. Thats the reason you should try to get adequate knowledge and information before you make any investment in bitcoins. Let us know if you want to know more.

Swiss stock exchange operator SIX Group hopes to launch a digital assets trading platform in the coming months. While most high street banks still turn their noses up at cryptocurrencies , such as bitcoin, they appear to be increasingly convinced that blockchain, can save time and money in the securities trading business. More More High salaries aren't what they seem in Switzerland If you are a male banker, a Swiss diplomat or a foreign CEO in Switzerland, chances are you are living quite comfortably. Swissquote now has a foot in both camps. It already allows clients to trade in cryptocurrencies. By the end of February, it held CHF1.8 billion worth of clients' cryptocurrencies in custody  up from CHF1 billion at the end of 2020. The bank forecasts revenues from this business line to double this year to CHF32 million. 'With Taurus' products, we can offer our customers an expanded range of investment opportunities in the field of digital assets,' stated deputy CEO Paolo Buzzi on Tuesday. It has an agreement to use three Taurus products to create tokenized securities, securely store them, interact with Ethereum smart contracts (which set the automated terms and conditions of the assets) and connect with other blockchain networks. 'We allow clients to handle any type of corporate action around digital assets,' says Brahimi.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is set to make its public market debut Wednesday at a valuation of between $50 billion and $100 billion, larger than major stock exchanges such as Nasdaq and Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. The move could force investors and institutions alike to take a closer look at the entire digital asset space, Amplify ETFs founder and CEO Christian Magoon told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" on Monday. ""There could be a revaluation for this whole segment higher when you see some of the numbers that come from Coinbase,"" said Magoon, whose blockchain-focused Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) will likely add Coinbase to its holdings after the debut. Coinbase's revenues for the first quarter of 2021 were 1.5 times its revenues for all of 2020. It is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States and will be the first of its kind to enter the public arena. ""I think we're going to see more private companies go public because they see the path, hopefully, that Coinbase takes that recognizes the value in the public marketplace,"" Magoon said. Additionally, at least four exchange-traded fund issuers have filed for crypto-related ETFs in the last two months that could take advantage of what will likely be the largest pure-play public company in the industry, Magoon said. ""This will be a new asset class in the ETF space that will be built out beyond the two or three funds that exist today,"" he said, adding that there's a high chance Ark Invest's fintech and innovation ETFs will also buy in. Investors simply ""can't ignore"" a company that grew earnings ninefold on a year-over-year basis, Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, said in the same ""ETF Edge"" interview. ""You just don't see this kind of growth from large-cap equities,"" said Hougan, whose company runs the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW). ""Every investor, not just crypto investors, are going to have to reckon with that growth, think about where it's going and decide if it belongs in a portfolio, and that just makes it a game changer for where crypto exists in the total capital market spectrum."" Hougan compared concerns around Coinbase's listing to the ones retail investors had about the 2012 IPO of Facebook, which also went public at a $100 billion valuation. ""People said the valuation was absurd. People didn't trust it because it was kids dressed in hoodies serving a new audience that they weren't familiar with. That's the same thing here. This is a giant company that's churning out real revenue and real profits,"" he said. ""I think those valuations may not be as absurd as people think, it's just people aren't comfortable with this corner of the economy in the same way they weren't comfortable with Facebook back in 2012."" The valuation conversation likely won't just stop at purely crypto companies, Tim Seymour, founder and chief investment officer of Seymour Asset Management, said in the same ""ETF Edge"" interview. ""This is a frontier that the multiples on what people are willing to pay don't make sense.

Commercial Observer,Blockchain carbon trading could be a savior for NYC real estate as landlords reckon with the costs of new environmental regulations.,"A blockchain-based carbon trading market could be a savior for New York City real estate in the wake of the city's new environmental regulations. Illustration: Spencer Alexander L aunching a blockchain-based trading system for carbon emissions  placing invisible gases in the care of the invisible hand of the market  may sound like the latest in trendy high-tech speculation, like cryptocurrency or the digital art obsession with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In New York City real estate circles, however, the idea isnt seen much as a novelty anymore, but rather as a potential savior, as landlords and building owners reckon with the costs of the citys landmark new environmental regulations. SEE ALSO: Protection Dissolving for Borrowers in NY Seeking to Halt UCC Sales Were using capitalism in a way that will decrease everybodys carbon footprint and be kinder to mother Earth, said John J. Gilbert III, chief operating officer and executive vice president of landlord Rudin Management Company, whos helping to design a prototype carbon credit trading system. Using market forces to accelerate the return on investment that owners make to improve their properties and decrease their carbon footprints is a good goal. I dont think anybody disagrees with that. Question is, how do we do that? Local Law 97, passed in 2019, stipulates that most New York City buildings over 25,000 square feet need to dramatically reduce their carbon footprint, with fines starting in 2024 and increasingly strict caps being applied beginning in 2030. The Urban Green Council estimates that it may cost the real estate industry $20 billion to meet the laws carbon reduction goals. While thats a hefty price tag, real estate interests are also frustrated at the ways the legislation limits their responses. Older, historic structures are held to what some see as impossible standards, and even brand-new office buildings with cutting-edge investments in sustainability will be hit with huge, multimillion-dollar fines annually because they house thousands of workers who use significant amounts of electricity all day. Gilbert believes Rudins portfolio alone could rack up millions of dollars in fines per year beginning in 2024. Business owners set to be hit by these 2024 caps dont have a lot of tools to meet them, and some who have invested significantly in efficiency will face significant penalties with few options, said Zachary Schechter-Steinberg, vice president of policy at the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY). Market advocates like Urban Green Council CEO John Mandyck believe trading carbon emission credits can solve the problems in the law, channeling fines into capital that can be invested in energy-efficiency upgrades in other buildings across the city. The groups study on carbon markets, released last June said the right regulations would unlock capital that could help buildings outside the scope of LL97 cut emissions, greatly speeding up the citys green push. The trading market is a breakthrough policy tool for cities, Mandyck said. New York City has $3 trillion of insured coastal property Thats nearly twice the GDP of Canada. It is in the enlightened self-interest of the real estate community to find a way to reduce carbon emissions. The idea of establishing a market for carbon credits was even written into the original law, which called for the city to publish a report on the mechanisms needed to establish such a market (the report, originally due this past January, is being finished by a panel of experts and is now expected early this summer). Its a logical extension, because cap and trade is a common form of incremental management, Mandyck said. What we have now is cap and no trade. Adding trade is a complementary way of addressing this issue. But as the idea of a market, and one based on the blockchain, becomes more popular as building owners grapple with the fines they may face in 2024, theres also a realization that setting up such a system is, in fact, even more complicated. The city and state government would need to pass new laws to enable the creation of such a market  the citys home rule exemption may not cover the creation of a market that could be construed as a tax  and members of the environmental coalition that backed the law arent in favor of a market. Such a proposed market would first create a network of data collection hubs on buildings and renewable power-generating sites. This information would then be analyzed and published on the blockchain, a powerful, peer-to-peer-distributed computer network that constantly and securely validates this vast trove of information. As Rudins Gilbert said, its a system to match real-time supply data with real-time demand. Next, this carbon data would be turned into credits, which owners and investors could store in a digital wallet and trade, much like how investors currently swap bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once this market is set up, carbon emissions become a commodity; owners who find cheap ways to cut emissions or fall below the cap can sell their excess credits to those who cant. Trading can also generate capital that can be used to fund projects in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, especially environmental justice communities that have suffered from under-investment and the presence of polluting infrastructure, such as power plants and industrial sites. Alec Saltikoff, an engineer and global head of sustainability at JPMorgan Chase, whos designed building management systems, is now helping to design a blockchain system in collaboration with Rudins Gilbert; Brookfield Renewable Partners (owned in large part by Brookfield Asset Management); KPMG; and ClearTrace, a startup focused on carbon accounting. Saltikoff said that the age of carbon tax is on us. Blockchain is an elegant and practical solution to the larger problem of creating both the level of trust and efficiency needed to swap carbon credits. To do the standard calculation for every single building in a large portfolio is impractical, Saltikoff said. That kind of carbon accounting simply doesnt exist. While cap-and-trade systems have been successfully leveraged for different markets, and have helped tackle environmental goals like decreasing acid rain or lowering power plant emissions, there isnt much of a track record around implementing something as complex as the carbon trading scheme being envisioned as an extension of LL97. Tokyo set up a similar market in 2010, but its still in its infancy. The citys regulations and carbon caps are relatively easy for owners to meet via small investments in energy efficiency, said Mandyck, so there hasnt been much of a need to trade credits. Just a few dozen trades have been made thus far, in a market that will only cover 5,000 buildings in total. Thats because the program was designed with self-reduction measures in mind, said Takuya Ozawa, who works for the Bureau of Environment in the Tokyo Metropolitan government; caps will like",https://commercialobserver.com/2021/04/can-blockchain-based-carbon-trading-save-nyc-real-estate-from-steep-fines/

But the processors can also be used for blockchain ledgers. NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang recently said in a CNBC interview that ""[b]lockchain's going to be here for a long time and it's going to be a fundamental new form of computing."" He added that blockchain and cryptocurrencies will both be important drivers for GPUs. NVIDIA doesn't break out its GPU sales for blockchain specifically, but it did say that in its third quarter of fiscal 2018, it made $70 million from GPU sales for cryptocurrency mining. Of course, blockchain and cryptocurrency mining aren't the same things, although they're related, so it's difficult to nail down just how important blockchain is to NVIDIA right now. But what we do know is that the company isn't betting its future on either trend NVIDIA's CFO Colette Kress said on the company's recent earnings call: ""While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter. That said, our main focus remains on our core gaming market, as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile."" Similarly, AMD is benefiting from blockchain, but it still represents a small portion of the company's total sales. The company recently said in a statement that the percentage of revenue related to blockchain was in the mid-single digits for 2017. It added: ""We appreciate the time and attention that investors continue to pay to Blockchain and cryptocurrency, but would also like to keep it in perspective with the multiple other growth opportunities ahead for AMD."" 5. It's being used to add transparency to media-buying. Salon Media Group is testing a blockchain ledger created by International Business Machines ( NYSE:IBM ) to record ad-buying contracts impression data, and how much Salon will be paid for the ads. Additionally, Unilever has begun using IBM's blockchain to buy some ads in the U.S. and keep track of its transactions. Tech executives rank IBM as one of the top blockchain companies in 2017, with 43% rating IBM's blockchain tech above all its competitors' systems, according to Juniper Research. 6. The tech can be used to manage power usage by electric companies. Blockchain can be used to modernize how electricity consumers share usage information with their utility providers, by securely and automatically sending their monthly consumption to a decentralized ledger. An MIT Technology Review article noted last year that energy producers and consumers could use blockchainto easily share data with each other: ""Advocates say the technology could be especially promising in industries where networks of peers -- electricity producers and consumers, connected via the grid, for instance -- depend on shared sets of data."" Some people in Brooklyn, New York, have even begun setting up their own ""microgrids"" by generating their own electricity using solar panels and then selling the power to their neighbors using a blockchain system That's an extreme example of blockchain's possibilities within the energy market, but simpler uses involve using the tech to easily and efficiently exchange metering and billing information with utility providers. 7. Blockchain adoption could revolutionize the global shipping industry. It takes a lot of complex logistics among companies using dozens of shipping lanes to move goods around the world. But the shipping industry is looking to blockchain to simplify this process by reducing days of paperwork to just minutes. A recent Bloomberg article said that the tech could be the biggest transformation in shippingsince the standardization of container sizes in the 1960s. If blockchain does indeed make it easier for companies to organize shipping, that could reduce the cost of goods sold around the world. 8. The U.S. government could use it to manage wireless spectrum. There's a very limited segment of the airwaves that the U.S. government currently licenses to commercial broadcasters and amateur operators. Some parts of this spectrum are used for things like commercial cellular signals, others are set up for government signals, and others are used for things like your home Wi-Fi. Blockchain could be used to manage these airwaves by using the tech to set up multiuse spectrums based on demand. Companies and individuals would be able to communicate their spectrum needs through a decentralized blockchain which could reduce the cost of allocating spectrum to only certain types of devices and systems, according to Wired. It may seem like an odd way to use the tech, but it's yet another example of blockchain's versatility. 9. It's being used to create digital IDs for people. More than 1 billion people in the world have no way to prove their identity, but a Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) blockchain project wants to change that. The company wants to create decentralized digital identification assigning each person a unique identifier that could be used for banking, health insurance, and even travel. A few thoughts on the blockchain market Blockchain is still in its infancy, and there are plenty more ways it can be used. Many companies are just getting started with their blockchain strategies, but as this trend continues, we're bound to see companies invest in it much more. While it clearly has lots of potential, I wouldn't make any investment decisions based solely on blockchain right now. There's still a lot of hype around the technology, and that sometimes leads investors to buy shares of a company simply because it dabbles in blockchain. Instead, I think investors should focus on technology companies that are already leaders in other markets and have the potential to benefit from blockchain.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-13 07:04:00,This Blockchain Rumor Could Be Huge for Qtum -- The Motley Fool,"If true, Qtum could soon be partnered with this well-known global coffee chain.",") Mar 7, 2018 at 9:21AM In case you haven't noticed, cryptocurrencies performed pretty darn well in 2017. In fact, the better than 3,300% gain in aggregate market cap last year made the ridiculously strong 20% gains in the S&P 500 look like a flat line in a side-by-side comparison. It's possible investors will never see an asset class deliver returns like this again over the course of 12 months. At the heart of the rally in digital currencies is blockchain technology For those unfamiliar, blockchain is the digital and decentralized ledger that underlies most virtual currencies and is responsible for recording all transactions. Blockchain first hit center stage when bitcoin debuted in 2009, and it has seemingly evolved and matured with each new cryptocurrency to hit the market since. Image source: Getty Images. Why the buzz over blockchain? It mostly has to do with perceived inefficiencies with the current banking system, such as exorbitant transaction fees and long processing times. Blockchain aims to resolve these issue by dramatically speeding up validation and settlement times, as well as removing banks from the equation as middlemen, thusly lowering transaction costs. Beyond the financial industry, blockchain has non-currency applications too. Blockchain is potentially the perfect technology, given its transparency and immutability (i.e., unchanging nature), to help oversee supply chains, manage digital identifications, or even log medical records. Qtum: Emerging from bitcoin's and Ethereum's shadow While cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, which have the largest respective market caps, have traditionally received most of the attention and glory, it's other virtual currencies that are emerging from their shadows and really creating a lot of buzz One such cryptocurrency is the Singapore-based Qtum. What makes Qtum unique is that its blockchain combines bitcoin's infrastructure with Ethereum's Virtual Machine, then adds a few proprietary twists. In other words, it takes the most popular aspects of bitcoin's currency-only focus, then takes the best attributes of Ethereum's predominantly non-currency-focused blockchain, and adds factors that'll make its blockchain unique. Image source: Getty Images. To begin with, Qtum relies on smart contracts like the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are protocols that help with validating, facilitating, and enforcing the negotiation of a contract. Think of them as legally binding parameters that are completely customizable by businesses that help to guide the execution of actions, such as when money can be spent, or when new products can be ordered or shipped. Secondly, Qtum's network, despite the expectation that it'll be regularly upgraded, will remain fully compatible with bitcoin gateways and Ethereum contracts. This means businesses that have already incorporated Ethereum smart contracts won't have to worry about integration issues if they were to switch over to Qtum's blockchain. Lastly, Qtum is attempting to make it easier than ever to use its blockchain, with Simple Payment Verification protocols being used in lite wallets via mobile applications. There aren't too many blockchains to offer a secure and decentralized mobile application as of yet. The Qtum Foundation has been a busy bee Of course, Qtum's blockchain technology is only meaningful if it can land brand-name partners and succeed in real-world testing. In January, Qtum landed two such partners Image source: Getty Images. First, it announced a partnership with 360 Finance, a subsidiary of Qihoo 360. The privately held Qihoo 360 is the company behind the 360 Search engine in China, which has the third-highest search market share in the country. This partnership will focus on developing next-generation smart contracts, consensus models, and blockchain software security. Just a day after its announced partnership with 360 Finance, Qtum partnered with Baofeng Bokocloud to achieve the world's first consensus network service. Baofeng's media player in China has more than 200 million active users, making it the perfect platform to use Qtum's blockchain to strengthen copyright protections. Baofeng's Bokocloud service also plans to help Qtum dramatically expand the number of nodes on its blockchain, which would increase the capacity of its network. But even these partnerships could take a back seat to a rumored tie-up that also gained steam in January and has yet to be confirmed or denied. Could Qtum land a whale? In mid-January, an administrator of the official Telegram Channel of Qtum announced that it would be partnering with global coffee giant Starbucks ( NASDAQ:SBUX ) , although no specifics were offered. Though the admin, when questioned, responded ""Yes, it's true. More details coming soon,"" no additional details have been offered via an official announcement or on Twitter. However, it is worth noting that Qtum has previously announced partnerships via its Telegram group prior to making an official announcement, according to various tech blogging websites. Image source: Starbucks. Why might Starbucks be interested in utilizing Qtum's blockchain technology? To begin with, blockchain can be used to make supply chains more transparent. Starbucks relies on its worldwide vendors to supply consistent grades of coffee. However, it's not always easy to assess if those quality grades are being consistently met from field to retail store. Blockchain, being transparent and immutable, would make it easy for Starbucks to track coffee beans from the field to their final destination. What's more, it would also be a lot easier for Starbucks to locate supply chain inefficiencies with blockchain as opposed to traditional paper-based tracking systems. Another substantial benefit is that it could dramatically improve cash flow to farmers in underbanked regions of the world. Assuming farmers can gain access to Qtum's application via a mobile device or personal computer, the delivery of beans could result in an almost instantaneous payment to the farmer, as opposed to waiting weeks or months to be paid. Farmers with improved cash flow may have the ability to upgrade equipment or improve crop yields to Starbucks' advantage. Though this is nothing more than an unconfirmed rumor at this point, it has the potential to be an absolute game-changer for Qtum, if true. Whether you're a blockchain enthusiast, Starbucks shareholder, or Qtum investor, it's worth keeping an eye on this rumor to see if it's proven true or eventually debunked.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-13 04:00:00,Surprise! This Company Holds the Most Blockchain Patents -- The Motley Fool,"Hint: Despite what you might think, it's not a technology company. However, it is a household name.",") Jan 21, 2018 at 9:04AM If you've been waiting for the greatest thing since sliced bread to come along, cryptocurrencies might be it. Over a 53-week span from the beginning of 2017 through the first week of January 2018, the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies surged by more than 4,500% to as much as $835 billion. At no point in history have investors seen a single asset class increase in value by more than 4,500% in roughly a year's time. There are, admittedly, a host of catalysts that have fueled the rally in cryptocurrencies. Investor emotions, a falling U.S. dollar, and news-driven events -- such as Japan accepting bitcoin as a legal form of tender beginning June 1, 2017 -- are all reasons behind the surge in cryptocurrencies. But if there were a single catalyst that rose above them all, it would have to be the emergence of blockchain technology Image source: Getty Images. Blockchain offers game-changing potential Blockchain, in its simplest form, is the digital and decentralized ledger that underpins virtual currencies and is responsible for logging all transactions. Its invention and evolution were predicated on the belief that the current banking system is inefficient and needs to be overhauled. Though blockchain offers numerous advantages, it intends to ""fix"" the financial services industry in three critical ways. First, as noted, it brings decentralization to the table. Rather than having all transactions stored in a data center, blocks of data that make up the chain are stored on servers and hard drives all over the globe. This ensures that no single entity can ever gain control over a cryptocurrency, and it keeps cybercriminals from being able to cripple a virtual currency by gaining access to data. Second, blockchain eliminates the need to process transactions with the involvement of a third party, which is most often a bank. Financial institutions love playing the third party since it means they get a fee for every transaction. Since blockchain transactions skirt the need for a third party, transaction fees are expected to be lower. Third, and perhaps most importantly it drastically speeds up transaction verification and settlement times. With today's banking system, it's not uncommon for cross-border payments to be held for three to five days before they're validated and settled. Given that blockchain transactions are being proofed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, verification and settlement can occur in a matter of seconds, depending on the network. It's also worth pointing out that while the financial services industry would benefit most from the implementation of blockchain, it's far from the only industry or sector that will. Technology, energy, and consumer goods companies are all looking at how blockchain could better help them manage networks or their supply chains. Image source: Getty Images. Blockchain patents could soon become a gold mine for businesses While the cryptocurrencies and companies developing and marketing blockchain for enterprises have a means to financially benefit, the intellectual property (IP) underlying blockchain technology could prove even more valuable over the long haul. We only need to look at Qualcomm, which has made tens of billions of dollars over its existence as a result of its wireless technologies (LTE, CDMA, UMTS, and GSM) patent portfolio, as evidence that patents can be worth a fortune. So, which companies currently hold the most blockchain patents? For that answer we turn to a recently released analysis from Envision IP, a New York-based law firm specializing in intellectual property. According to its analysis, 1,045 patents or applications related to blockchain had been filed in the U.S. by 478 owners. A majority of these were filed by ""blockchain-specific companies"" or cryptocurrency start-ups, according to Maulin Shah, managing attorney at Envision IP. However, there are a handful of companies that stood out as owning more blockchain patents than others. For example, Fidelity Investments, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Accenture, Dell, and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase all ranked in the top 10. In a tie for second, with 27 blockchain patents each, were payment facilitator MasterCard and IBM ( NYSE:IBM ) . IBM probably comes as no surprise, as it's a tech company that's been on the leading edge of blockchain development. In fact, it announced this past week that it and global shipping company Maersk would be forming an as-of-yet unnamed joint venture spinoffcompany devoted to shipping-based blockchain solutions and supply chain management. Image source: Bank of America. You'll never guess which company holds the most blockchain patents However, sitting at the top of the pack, well ahead of every other company is...Bank of America ( ) . Who saw that coming, right? According to Envision IP, Bank of America has 43 blockchain patents or applications, although Mark Pipitone, a Bank of America spokesperson, said in an email to Bloomberg that the company had 48 blockchain-related patents and applications. Why the difference? The Envision IP study only included patents and applications that were made public, which often occurs about 18 months after they're filed. This means that other major tech players like Google (a subsidiary of Alphabet) or Microsoft -- companies that you'd expect to be leading the charge in game-changing technological development -- may in fact be ramping up their blockchain IP, but it hasn't shown up in Envision IP's analysis as of yet. What's interesting about Bank of America leading the pack on blockchain IP is that it has been very much against allowing its clients to invest in cryptocurrencies. It hasn't opened the door to bitcoin futures trading for clients like a number of other investment firms have and has closed off other avenues in equity markets that would have given its clients exposure to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Yet, these roughly four dozen patents and applications related to blockchain could be worth a fortune. If blockchain can be scaled to handle the same number of transactions the current payment networks process, and their processing speeds don't slow, widespread adoption is a possibility. Image source: Getty Images. Remember to be realistic Still, it's important for investors in these blockchain patent-holding stocks to keep two things in mind. For starters, there are no guaranteesthat blockchain will be widely adopted by businesses anytime soon. We have to face the fact that blockchain has been around for about a decade, and it has taken that long to really begin to see widespread demos and small-scale tests. Even if companies like what they see, the technology itself is unproven on a large scale, and it would require, at least in some industries, a complete retooling of either payment or supply-chain networks. I believe the mainstream adoption of blockchain is still many years out, making these blockchain patents and applications more of a long-term story. Also, there are few if any guarantees that tod",https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/21/surprise-this-company-holds-the-most-blockchain-pa.aspx?source=isafpbcs0000001
fool,NotProvided,2021-04-13 00:00:00,Getting a Handle on Virtual Currencies -- The Motley Fool,These relatively new assets come with unique opportunities and risks.,"system called mining. What is blockchain? Blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology, is the technology that powers bitcoin and many other virtual currencies. In the case of bitcoin, blockchain functions through the participation of many individuals who offer their computing power to maintain the Bitcoin Network and record transactions (for instance, when someone trades or spends bitcoins). Those who employ math and technology to create new bitcoins are known as ""miners."" Miners engage in complex computing problems to facilitate the verification and posting of bitcoin transactions. As a reward for solving these computing problems, a bitcoin miner is awarded a new bitcoin. All of this computing takes a lot of energy, which is why today's mining centers tend to be located in regions where energy is inexpensive. Blockchain technology is the critical feature of bitcoin because it prevents users of bitcoin from double-spending their coins and creates a permanent record of transactions. Are there other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin is one of thousands of cryptocurrencies. The purpose, functionalities, and use of these cryptocurrencies may vary. Some share similarities with bitcoin. For instance, Litecoin, created in 2011 by MIT-cum-Google coding prodigy Charlie Lee, is similar in many respects to bitcoin but it is not identical, since it uses a different mining algorithm. Ethereum (2015), on the other hand, is in fact a platform for ""smart contracts,"" which are known as conditional transactions: computer code that enable certain events to be triggered when certain pre-defined conditions are met, such as the ability to unlock real products (renting a car, for instance) when payment is made. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency known as Ether, which can be the form of payment used on these smart contracts. Use caution Knowing about virtual currencies and investing in them are two very different things. Investing in virtual currencies can take different forms. You can purchase coins in the hope they will appreciate or invest in platforms that facilitate blockchain technology and other aspects of the virtual currency revolution and hope they succeed. Doing so carries significant risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose, and be aware that you may lose some or all of your investment. Like other types of investing, virtual currency investing has its share of fraud and scams, not to mention cyber attacks. There are also major questions about how these currencies are regulated both domestically and across the globe. Less regulation means less protection for investors.

The state, which sold off its ownership interest in the 1980s, will once again own a piece of Canadas largest airline, buying C$500 million of shares at a discount. Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus government also negotiated warrants as part of a broad financing agreement that makes Air Canada eligible for five new credit facilities totaling C$5.38 billion, according to a company statement.In return for the money, Air Canada agreed to restrict share buybacks and dividends, keep employment at April 1 levels and follow through on a deal to buy 33 Airbus SE A220s made at a factory in Quebec. Executives wont be allowed to earn more than C$1 million.And the airline will resume service on routes its suspended to distant locations such as Gander, Newfoundland and Yellowknife, in the countrys far north. The long-anticipated announcement will ease tensions between the industry and Trudeaus government, which since last March has barred most foreign travelers from entering the country and recently made the rules even tougher.Air Canada repeatedly complained that its home country was the only Group of Seven member without an aid plan specifically for the aviation sector -- although the company has used federal wage subsidies available to all industries hit by the pandemic.We wanted a good deal, not just any deal. And getting a good deal can sometimes take a little time, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said at a news conference Monday evening.Air Canada also committed to paying back customers who didnt take flights they had booked because of Covid-19. One of the credit facilities, a C$1.4 billion line, is dedicated to financing refunds.Solid Guarantees Air Canada will issue 21.6 million new shares. While the equity component is somewhat surprising, the package is the money thats needed, said Robert Kokonis, managing director of Toronto-based aviation consulting firm AirTrav Inc.Its going to take a lot of aid for carriers. Weve been through a lot. Weve been on standby while airlines in countries around the world have received one or more aid packages, Kokonis said. Freeland said talks are ongoing with other airlines, including WestJet Airlines Ltd., controlled by Toronto-based investment firm Onex Corp. Tour operator Transat AT Inc. also needs money and has said its talking to the government after a deal to be taken over by Air Canada fell apart. Wherever and whenever the federal government provides public aid, the supported company will have to give solid guarantees, as Air Canada did, that the public interest will be respected, workers protected, and travelers interest defended, Freeland said.As of March 18, government financing for the airline industry globally -- including loans and equity stakes in exchange for cash -- has totaled more than $183 billion, according to Ishka Ltd., an aviation finance and investment consultancy.Before Mondays agreement, Canadas most visible lifeline to the industry was a combined C$375 million in emergency loans to Sunwing Airlines Inc. and Sunwing Vacations Inc., a small vacation operator.Air Canada said it will only draw down the new credit facilities as required. The package includes C$2.48 billion in unsecured loans. This program provides additional liquidity, if required, to rebuild our business to the benefit of all stakeholders and to remain a significant contributor to the Canadian economy through its recovery and for the long term, Chief Executive Officer Michael Rousseau said in a statement.(Updates with new details, analyst quote.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 7h ago Bitcoin hits record before landmark Coinbase listing on Nasdaq LONDON (Reuters) -Bitcoin hit a record of $62,741 on Tuesday, extending its 2021 rally to new heights a day before the listing of Coinbase shares in the United States.
