2,"bitcoins: From crypto art to trading cards, investment manias abound",indiatimes,"Mar 14, 2021",2021-03-14 09:42:00,"Even as millions were laid off in the pandemic, many peoples bank accounts flourished, flush from relief checks and government cash infusions into the economy. Bitcoin may serve as digital gold in future: DBS Bank CEO By Erin Griffith SAN FRANCISCO: This past week, a trading cardfeaturing quarterback Tom Brady sold for a record $1.3 million. The total value of the cryptocurrencyBitcoin hit $1 trillion. And Christies sold a digital artwork by an artist known as Beeple for $69.3 million after bids started at just $100. These seemingly singular events were all connected, part of a series of manias that have gripped the financial world. For months, professional and everyday investors have pushed up the prices of stocks and real estate. Now the frenzy has spilled over into the riskiest  and in some cases, wackiest  assets, including digital ephemera and media, cryptocurrencies, collectibles like trading cards and even sneakers. The surges have been driven by a unique set of conditions. Even as millions were laid off in the pandemic, many peoples bank accounts flourished, flush from relief checks and government cash infusions into the economy. But while people accumulated more money, traditional investments like stocks and bonds became less attractive. So many got creative and, bored in the pandemic, took on more risk. Often, they were egged on by online communities on Reddit and Discord, where the next big investments were hotly debated. They also turned to tech tools like the trading app Robinhood and the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, which allowed them to buy and trade different items with the click of a button. That has now led to minibubbles across a wide variety of esoteric categories, making once-obscure acronyms like SPACs and NFTs practically as ubiquitous as the S&P. It has also fed ferocious demand for this past weeks public listings of companies like gaming site Roblox and South Korean e-commerce company Coupang, as well as for shares of video game retailer GameStop and other so-called meme stocks. Its just a pent-up cycle where the money has nowhere to go, so its doing stupid things, said Howard Lindzon, an investor, entrepreneur and market commentator. The manias, which have erupted at a time of deep economic pain, have introduced a large amount of risk to many investors. Some people have already racked up staggering losses on Robinhood, which has been accused of encouraging gamblinglike behavior. Other assets, like Bitcoin, are volatile, while sneakers and NFTs are so new and hyped up that it is difficult to know what they will be worth over time. For now, the bubble-upon-bubble behavior does not appear to pose a systemic risk to the broader financial system. But some investors said they were uneasy. Most people are cheering but at the same time shaking their heads and going, when is the bust coming? said Jane Leung, chief investment officer at SVB Private Bank. One of those who bought into the frenzy was Matthew Schorr, 35, a lawyer in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. For years, he has been on the lookout for hot investments but lost interest in the stock market and abandoned Bitcoinafter his friends dismissed the cryptocurrency as fake money. He now regrets that because the value of a single Bitcoin has soared above $57,000, meaning the eight Bitcoin he paid for a Dominos pizza in 2011 would be worth more than $450,000 today. Schorr did not want to miss out again. So starting in January, he spent $5,000 to buy 351 videos from NBATop Shot, a site for trading basketball highlight clips, after he saw social media chatter about them selling for tens of thousands of dollars. The value of those clips has now soared to $67,000, according to Momentranks.com, which tracks the sales. The clips are a type of investment known as NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, which have taken off in music, art and sports. The digital tokens use networks of computers to prove that a digital item like a video, image or song is authentic, giving the item a value  at least in the eyes of the person buying it. Some liken NFTs to digital trading cards. (The creators of the underlying works typically retain the copyright.) Skeptics consider NFTs among the most questionable of assets, since an NFT image can be endlessly copied and shared. Still, enough people are convinced of the value of authenticating tokens that they have dovetailed with another market-propelling phenomenon: FOMO, or fear of missing out. Im trying to keep my finger on the pulse and not let myself fall behind again, said Schorr, who spends as much as five hours a day researching the market and chatting with fellow collectors on Discord. That sort of return over six weeks is completely unheard-of in any financial vehicle. Last month, NBA Top Shot crossed $232 million in total sales since it started last year  including $47.5 million in sales on a single day. I think there is another 100X from here, said Roham Gharegozlou, chief executive of Dapper Labs, the company that partnered with the NBA to create NBA Top Shot. There is so much demand. Much of this investment momentum began last year after the coronavirus spread and the global economy went into free fall. In response, the United States slashed interest rates, bought government bonds and passed relief packages. Germany, Brazil, Japan and other countries took similar actions. Those moves had a twofold effect of increasing the amount of money in the global financial system while also encouraging people to spend. Deposits in U.S. bank accounts hit $16.45 trillion last month, more than $3 trillion above the level in January 2020, according to Federal Reserve data. The interest rate set by the Federal Reserve has been near zero since last March. Low interest rates made traditional investments like bonds less attractive, while stocks, which have risen for a decade, became even more expensive. That was when more people started investing in nontraditional assets. With NFTs, the hysteria escalated quickly. Last month, an NFT GIF of Nyan Cat, which shows an animated flying cat with a Pop-Tart body, sold for roughly $580,000. Other artists, including Grimesand Steve Aoki, began reaping millions of dollars from their digital artwork. Then Thursday, Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, sold his Everydays  The First 5000 Days NFT for a stunning $69.3 million. Slava Rubin, founder of Vincent, a startup that helps people find investments in alternative assets such as wine, collectibles and litigation finance, said his site has attracted tens of thousands of users. Last month, he said, interest in NFTs jumped by 44% and collectibles by 33%, making them the fastest-growing categories on the site. The public is really leaning into these new ways of thinking about how to invest, whether its for pure profit, a hobby or based on nostalgia and interest, he said. This month, electronic musician 3lau made $11.7 million selling NFTs related to one of his previously released albums. Buyers not only received the digital tokens representing the authentic version of the album but also got access to new music and a limited edition vinyl copy. 3lau, whose real name is Jus",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/from-crypto-art-to-trading-cards-investment-manias-abound/printarticle/81491437.cms

In comments that appear to undercut the precious metals renowned status, Russ Koesterich claims that golds ability to hedge against inflation has been somewhat exaggerated. Gold Less Reliable Across Most Investment Horizons While Koesterich is still cognizant of golds status as a reasonable store of value over the very long-term, he does however opine that it is less reliable across most investment horizons. Already, Koesterichs firm, Blackrock, which has assets under management worth almost $9 trillion, appears to have acted on this new knowledge. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, Blackrock has started to investin BTC Still, as one reportnotes, gold has for years been viewed as that part of a multi-asset portfolio that can help to balance out shifts in other holdings, especially equities. Yet as this Blackrock executive remarks, gold is currently not working well as a hedge against either stock moves or inflation risks, although it was against the dollar. Sinking Gold ETF Volumes Meanwhile, in order to back Koesterichs assertions, the report uses the precious metals recent performances in comparison to the USD and U.S. equities. The report, which uses March 11 data, states: Spot gold traded at $1,735.16 an ounce at 9:35 a.m. in London, down more than 8% this year, while a gauge of the U.S. currency has risen about 1.8%. Among equity benchmarks, the S&P 500 Index has gained almost 4% in 2021. Furthermore, the report also notes that gold&rsquo;s decline in 2021 has been accompanied by a steady drawdown in holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded funds. According to the report, global ETF volumes have sunk to the lowest since June, losing about 150 tons so far in 2021. Meanwhile, in laying out his predictions for the precious metal, the portfolio manager hints at possible headwinds for the commodity. Koesterich points to more stimulus and improving vaccine distribution (which) suggest the possibility of an economic surge as his reasons for the negative prediction. Coincidentally, Koesterichs sentiments about golds prospects are also shared by ABN Amro Bank, which warned in January that gold had peaked and would drop.

5,The Congolese Mountain of Gold: Surprise Discovery in Africa Shows Metal's Scarcity Is Hard to Prove  Finance Bitcoin News,bitcoin,"Mar 13, 2021",2021-03-13 03:14:17,"The Congo is well known for being a region that sees tons of smuggled gold filtered into the global financial system unreported. 10 hours ago The Congolese Mountain of Gold: Surprise Discovery in Africa Shows Metal's Scarcity Is Hard to Prove A myriad of gold bugs like to compliment the yellow precious metal for its ostensible scarcity, as estimates say only 2,500 to 3,000 tons of new gold is produced annually. While new gold discoveries have seemingly slowed, investigative studies also show that in some areas, gold is being smuggled into the economy by the ton, and often never accounted for as far as per annum issuance estimates. Recently, reports show a whole mountain of gold was discovered in the Congo, as the Democratic Republic of the Congo is well known for being a region that sees tons of smuggled gold filtered into the global financial system unreported. Surprise Gold Deposits Continue to Crack the Precious Metals Scarcity Proposition It has always been said that the precious metal gold (Au) is scarce, and some reports even say that gold mining on earth will end by the year 2050 Additionally, estimatesalso show that theres roughly 2,500 to 3,000 tons of new gold that is accounted for and enters into the financial economy every single year. However, one unfortunate thing for those who believe gold is very scarce is the fact that surprise discoveries happen all the time. Lots of these gold discoveries go unaccounted for exceeding the so-called 3,000 tons of new gold dug up every year. In recent times, analysts have questioned golds safe-haven status, as central banks worldwide hoarding bullion could flood the market. Data from 2008s economic crisis shows that central banks oversaturated bullion markets during the subprime mortgage disaster. Surprise gold deposit finds and underreported issuance by artisanal miners also make it hard to prove gold is truly scarce. For example at the end of October 2020, Bitcoin.coms newsdesk reported on a surprise find of approximately 40 million troy ounces of gold in Russias Siberian region. The only reason the public hears about these discoveries, is if the gold find was discovered by local media sources. For instance, in August last year, the historical region of Central Europe, situated in Poland and called Silesia, suddenly saw the discovery of 5,000 tons of new gold. The massive gold depositsfound in the Silesian village of course was taken over by the countrys Ministry of the Environment. The 350 residents that live in Silesia had zero rights to the tonnage, but the news caused wider interest in the region. The news reporter, Anne Chatham, explained that no date was set to begin mining the ore, but local people expressed their hopes that the discovery will benefit the region or attract tourists. Last Week Villagers from the Congo Discovered a Mountain Filled With Gold During the first week of March 2021, a Yemeni freelance journalist based in the capital Sanaa, Ahmad Algohbary,reported on a massive mountain of gold discovered in the Congo. There are no confirmed estimates as to how much gold was found in the region, but the countrys authorities banned artisanal mining throughout the Congos South Kivu province. A video from the Republic of the Congo documents the biggest surprise for some villagers in this country, as an entire mountain filled with gold was discovered, Algohbary tweeted They dig the soil inside the gold deposits and take them to their homes in order to wash the dirt [and] extract the gold. Algohbary shared another videoof residents from the Republic of the Congo panning for gold and finding significantly-sized deposits from the mountain. Yemeni freelance journalist based in the capital Sanaa, Ahmad Algohbary, shared a video from the Congo that went viral last week. The video shows people who swarmed to the village in the Congos South Kivu province because of a mountain found there has shown the soil was littered with gold deposits. The issue with gold deposits in areas like the Congo is that a recent United Nations (UN) report has found gold production in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to be systematically underreported. The recent UN reportsays the Congo and other countries alongside the eastern border have been known to be major gold regions worth billions. The gold is being mined out of the earth by what people call artisanal miners. It has been said that artisanal miners mine by rudimentary means like using shovels in contrast to major operations with powered excavators. Massive amounts of gold in the Congo alone filters into the financial system underreported, and derive from regions like the provincial capital of Bukavu, Ituri province, and Luhihi. Bitcoin Is Scarcer Than Gold and This Can be Proven in Code, Gold Scarcity Based on Faith and Unreliable Estimates The mountain of gold discovered during the first week of March stemmed from Luhihi, and caused a significant gold rush of shovelers and artisanal miners. The gold mountain invoked thousands of people to swarm the village in the Congos South Kivu province. South Kivus Minister, Venant Burume Muhigirwa, saidthe gold rush added pressure to the small village of residents. Muhigirwa and local authorities forced artisanal miners and even members of Congos armed forces (FARDC) to leave the mountain of gold. All mining activities were suspended until further notice, Muhigirwa said. The United Nations report says that gold leaving the Congo and other countries alongside the eastern border is usually systematically underreported. The stories and the recent UN report, ultimately show that the shiny, yellow precious metal called gold (Au) may not be as rare as we think it is or are led to believe. Discoveries like the mountain of gold in the Congo and the 5,000 tons found in the Silesian village in August, indicate that massive gold deposits are found regularly and lots of gold finds are systematically underreported. The digital asset bitcoin (BTC)protocol, on the other hand, is known to have a maximum supply limit of 21 million. A crypto-asset like BTCis considered a lot scarcer than gold, and the protocol ensures there wont be any surprise discoveries or underreported issuance. New and massively sized gold deposits found in regions all around the world, not to mention the untapped ore under the ocean(20 million tons) and the gold that could be mined from asteroids makes it awfully hard for someone to prove that gold is the scarcer asset in comparison to bitcoin. NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has recently been contemplatingbuilding a spacecraft called the Psyche. The spacecraft aims to capture images of a metal-rock asteroid dubbed 16 Psyche. The 226-kilometer wide asteroid is made of gold and other metals with an estimated value of around 10,000 quadrillion-dollars.

8,Bitcoin's price is skyrocketing  so is its carbon footprint,cbsnews,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 12:02:46,"The energy-hogging digital currency is on track to consume as much electricity as all of the data centers around the world. As Bitcoin's price skyrockets, so does its carbon footprint One group of researchers at the University of New Mexico has put a price on that pollution, estimatingin a paper that every dollar of bitcoin value mined accounts for 49 cents' worth of health and climate damage in the U.S. ""With each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefit,"" the paper states. 03:45 Other studies have found that the environmental damage caused by crypto mining is on par with mineral mining In an article published in Nature Climate Change, scientists warned that if it were to become as widely adopted as other new technologies, bitcoin alone could push the Earth's temperature 2 degrees above historical levels  ""Bitcoin is inefficient by design. This inefficiency is the price we pay for security,"" said Anton Dek, crypto asset and blockchain lead at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (and one of the researchers on the bitcoin energy tracker). The process of mining a bitcoin involves multitudes of computers competing to solve a complex math problem, in which the first to reach a solution is rewarded with a bitcoin. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult, for instance, to hack the bitcoin blockchain. It also means that how much bitcoin you can mine depends on how much computing power you can throw at the problem. That has effectively set off an arms race in which miners invest in even more computing equipment that they keep running 24 hours a day. And the more expensive bitcoin gets, the more people want a shot at the action. Racks of ASIC mining devices and power units at the BitCluster cryptocurrency mining farm in Norilsk, Russia, on December 20, 2020. Norilsk hosts the Arctic's first crypto farm for producing new bitcoins. Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images ""If it's more profitable, it encourages more people to enter this competition  it encourages more miners to come,"" Dek said. Dek is less concerned than others about bitcoin's potential environmental impact, pointing out that crypto mining uses as much electricity as Americans waste by plugging in electrical appliances that are not running. Most miners use some renewable energy, according to Cambridge research although more than 60% of crypto mining is powered by fossil fuels. ""We are trying to make the point here that it is not that bad,"" Dek said. ""We also don't want to say it's not an issue at all."" As good as gold? ""We see the use case of bitcoin more and more as gold. It's something to preserve value, not for everyday transactions,"" Dek said. That sort of comparison, however, may be driving bitcoin into a speculative frenzy that could ""lock in"" high emissions for years to come. Bitcoin's price surge has caused a run on bitcoin mining computers, with Bitmain, a major maker of so-called mining rigs, sold out through August while competitor Canaan is working through a backlog of 100,000 orders These purchases aren't refundable, De Vries noted, which means that once miners receive their equipment they are likely to use them  even if a digital coin's price has fallen in the meantime. ""All you care about once you get the machine is, how much do I pay for electricity to run this machine? The sunk cost doesn't matter anymore,"" he said. So even if bitcoin's price were to drop by half, the planet is likely locked into high emissions from crypto mining for the near term  unless more miners can find cleaner sources of power to meet their computing demands, or more regions follow China's lead to restrict or eliminate bitcoin mining altogether. ""You have all these miners using electricity  you can boot them off the grid if you want to. That's an option you have as a regulator,"" De Vries said. Unlike other economic activities, the bitcoin scheme produces absolutely nothing for all this waste. It is a pure speculative activity of people gambling on the random movements of prices and the only output is simply shuffling numbers around in a computer at insane cost.

12,Energy riches fuel bitcoin craze for speculation-shy Iceland,nationalpost,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 08:02:00,"KEFLAVIK, Iceland  Iceland is expected to use more energy mining bitcoins and other virtual currencies this year than it uses to power its homes. Energy riches fuel bitcoin craze for speculation-shy Iceland Back to video The new industrys relatively sudden growth prompted lawmaker Smari McCarthy of Icelands Pirate Party to suggest taxing the profits of bitcoin mines. The initiative is likely to be well received by Icelanders, who are skeptical of speculative financial ventures after the countrys catastrophic 2008 banking crash. Under normal circumstances, companies that are creating value in Iceland pay a certain amount of tax to the government, McCarthy told The Associated Press. These companies are not doing that, and we might want to ask ourselves whether they should. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The energy demand has developed because of the soaring cost of producing and collecting virtual currencies. Computers are used to make the complex calculations that verify a running ledger of all the transactions in virtual currencies around the world. In return, the miners claim a fraction of a coin not yet in circulation. In the case of bitcoin, a total of 21 million can be mined, leaving about 4.2 million left to create. As more bitcoin enter circulation, more powerful computers are needed to keep up with the calculations  and that means more energy. The serene coastal town of Keflavik on Icelands desolate southern peninsula has over the past months boomed as an international hub for mining bitcoins and other virtual currencies. Local fishermen, chatting over steaming cups of coffee at the harbour gas station, are puzzled by the phenomenon, which has spawned oversize construction sites on the outskirts of town. Among the main attractions of setting up bitcoin mines at the edge of the Arctic Circle is the natural cooling for computer servers and the competitive prices for Icelands abundance of renewable energy from geothermal and hydroelectric power plants. Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson, a business development manager at the energy company Hitaveita Sudurnesja, said he expected Icelands virtual currency mining to double its energy consumption to about 100 megawatts this year. That is more than households use on the island nation of 340,000, according to Icelands National Energy Authority. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Four months ago, I could not have predicted this trend  but then bitcoin skyrocketed and we got a lot more emails, he said at the Svartsengi geothermal energy plant, which powers the southwestern peninsula where the mining takes place. Just today, I came from a meeting with a mining company seeking to buy 18 megawatts, he said. At the largest of three bitcoin farms currently operating within Keflavik  called Mjolnir after the hammer of Thor, the Norse god of thunder  high metal fences surround 50 metre-long (164 foot) warehouse buildings stacked with computer rigs. The data centres here are specially designed to utilize the constant wind on the bare peninsula. Walls are only partial on each side, allowing a draft of cold air to cool down the equipment. What we are doing here is like gold mining, said Helmut Rauth, who manages operations for Genesis Mining, a major bitcoin mining company. We are mining on a large scale and getting the gold out to the people. Genesis Mining, founded in Germany, moved to Iceland in 2014 when the price of bitcoin fluctuated from $350 to $1000. Today, one bitcoin is valued at about $8,000, according to tracking site Coindesk, after peaking at almost $19,500 in December. The currency took a hit in January when China announced it would move to wipe out its bitcoin mining industry, following concerns of excessive electricity consumption. Rauth said bitcoin should not be singled out as environmentally taxing. Computing power always demands energy, he argues. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content How much energy is needed for credit card transactions and internet research? Cryptocurrencies have the same global impact, he said. In the capital, Reykjavik, some are more skeptical about bitcoin. The last time Iceland was an international hub for finance, the venture ended with a giant bank crash, making the country one of the symbols of the 2008 global financial crisis. The political turmoil following the crash swept the upstart Pirate Party into Icelands parliament, where it currently holds 10 per cent of seats. Pirate Party legislator McCarthy has questioned the value of bitcoin mining for Icelandic society, saying residents should consider regulating and taxing the emerging industry. We are spending tens or maybe hundreds of megawatts on producing something that has no tangible existence and no real use for humans outside the realm of financial speculation, he said. That cant be good.

13,Anatomy of a bitcoin transaction: Buying a used Subaru,nationalpost,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 05:16:00,"EAST GREENBUSH, N.Y.  Bitcoins can buy you a TAG Heuer watch, a cross-country flight or a meatball marinara sub. But really, how does it work? Anatomy of a bitcoin transaction: Buying a used Subaru Back to video And the complex workings behind the notoriously volatile currency can be off-putting to neophytes. What are the fees? Are there taxes? How do you spend a currency that can devalue dramatically between ordering appetizers and paying the check? Buying with bitcoin can be as easy as tapping your phone, though there are some cautions. A look at a single bitcoin transaction, the sale of a 2017 Subaru from an upstate New York car dealer to a buyer from Virginia: IN BUSINESS WITH BITCOIN Eugene Rubinchuk didnt get into digital currency for the anonymity or to strike a blow against centralized banking. He was just looking for more business. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Rubinchuk and his father, who goes by Mike the Russian, already ham it up in local TV commercials for Michaels Auto Plaza wearing furry hats. Digital currency is just another potential edge. Its just a way to reach customers we normally couldnt reach, that normally wouldnt think of us, he said. The cars and truck on the lot near Albany are priced in U.S. dollars. Rubinchuk simply signed up for one of the services that allowed him to accept digital currencies if a bitcoin buyer came along. CASHING IN CRYPTOCURRENCY Jonathan Cypert got into bitcoin early and made out well. In 2011, he read about a 2-year-old currency skyrocketing in value and soon invested $2,000 in computers to mine bitcoins for about a year and a half. Thats the complicated process that rewards tech-savvy participants for verifying bitcoin transactions in its public ledger, called the blockchain. When he started, a single bitcoin was worth around $2.50. By the time he was ready to buy a used, low-mileage Subaru for his wife, a bitcoin was worth over $14,000. The 32-year-old Virginia resident sees his bitcoin cache as a nest egg to tide him over after he retires from the military. (Wary of attracting scammers, Cypert requested that his hometown and military branch not be made public). The purchase gave him a chance to recoup his investment many times over with a fraction of his cache. At this point its like, why not? Cypert said. I might as well realize some of that gain. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content BITCOIN BARGAINING Rubinchuk and Cypert talked on the phone the evening of Jan. 2 and settled on a sale price on the Subaru WRX STI of $34,640. Then they had to agree on what that equaled in bitcoins judging by the exchange rates that moment. Tracking bitcoin prices on their screens, the pair agreed to proceed with one bitcoin equaling about $14,755. Cypert sent 2.34790481 bitcoins from his personal electronic wallet to the public address of Rubinchuks wallet. Cypert also paid a network fee of about $3.50, money that goes to reward miners and keep the system running. Then Rubinchuk watched bitcoins value go up and down as he waited to convert his digital money into dollars. BLOCKCHAIN BLUES Rubinchuk wanted to convert quickly in case bitcoins value suddenly dropped against the dollar, costing him money. The fear is well-founded, since bitcoins value can gain or lose more than $400 in a half-hour. But the digital currency service he uses required him to wait for multiple confirmations from the bitcoin network before he could convert it into dollars, a process can be affected by network congestion and other factors. Rubinchuk recalls waiting about 30 to 45 minutes. Im sitting there on pins and needles checking every five minutes if its available, he said. Rubinchuk converted the sale into dollars with bitcoin just slightly below where it was at the time of the sale earlier that evening. He made about $7 less than the sale price. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The money was in his businesss bank account within 48 hours. Rubinchuk soon after signed up for a separate merchant account through another provider that assesses him a 1 per cent fee on all transactions, insulating him from short-term volatility. He compares it favourably to credit card fees that run 2 to 3 per cent for merchants. KEEPING IT LEGAL Digital currencies are notoriously used by criminals to transfer funds anonymously. But Rubinchuk told the tax collector about this transaction. In a standard IRS form for cash payments over $10,000, he reported the money he received, from whom it came and the fact that it originated via bitcoin. Cypert avoided sales tax under a federal law covering service members that lets him retain his official residency in Alaska, which does not have a sales tax. But he will pay taxes on a long-term capital gain. YOUR TIME MAY VARY Bitcoin miner fees have dropped markedly this year, and advocates say congestion issues are being solved by new technologies. Rubinchuk waited about 15 minutes to make a dollar exchange last week for his second bitcoin sale, a 2016 Hyundai Elantra. And recently in Hillsboro, Oregon, Jeff Hanzlik bought $288 worth of marijuana-growing supplies from a store in a transaction that took a few minutes to finalize. He transmitted 0.03305451 in bitcoins from his phone, which read a code on the merchants tablet. The same phone app allowed Hanzlik to choose to pay about a quarter in fees. Once you understand what this technology is and this genies out of the bottle, youre not going to have any choice but to be using it in the future, Hanzlik said. But the bitcoin network at this stage is still not well suited for smaller, everyday transactions, said Christian Catalini, founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Cryptoeconomics Lab. If youre thinking about paying for coffee in bitcoin, thats not what its good at right now, he said. Things can change.

14,Bitcoin's rise may reflect a transfer of social trust  away from government to computers,nationalpost,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 04:02:00,"Bitcoins rise may reflect a monumental transfer of social trust: away from institutions backed by government and to systems reliant on computer code Bitcoin's rise may reflect a transfer of social trust  away from government to computers Back to video a bubble , but not all bubbles are created equal. Some are shimmering nothings, reflecting little more than an underlying pyramid scheme. But others are like ocean swells that could become enormous waves. Consider the tech stocks of the late 1990s  a bubble, to be sure, but in retrospect, was Amazon really overvalued? Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Increasingly, we are losing faith in humans and depending instead on machines What gives the Bitcoin bubble significance is that, like 90s tech, it is part of something much larger than itself. More and more we are losing faith in humans and depending instead on machines. The transformation is more obvious outside of finance. We trust in computers to fly airplanes, help surgeons cut into our bodies, and simplify daily tasks, like finding our way home. In this respect, finance is actually behind: where we no longer feel we can trust people, we let computer code take over. Bitcoin is part of this trend. It was, after all, a carnival of human errors and misfeasance that inspired the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, namely, the financial crisis. Banks backed by economically powerful nations had been the symbol of financial trustworthiness, the gold standard in the post-gold era. But they revealed themselves as reckless, drunk on other peoples money, holding extraordinarily complex assets premised on a web of promises that were often mutually incompatible. To a computer programmer, the financial system still looks a lot like untested code with weak debugging that puts way too much faith in the idea that humans will behave properly. As with any bad software, it can be expected to crash when conditions change. We might add that major governments  the issuers of currency, the guarantors of banks, and enforcers of contracts  do not always inspire confidence. Governments can be tempted to print money recklessly or seize wealth brazenly from their citizens  Venezuelan hyperinflation and Indian demonetization are recent examples. But even the most trusted governments can be dubious. Europe, riddled by internal struggles among states, is still in shock about the planned departure of Britain from the European Union. China is a secretive authoritarian state that can lash out against its citizens and rivals when it feels insecure. The United States, perhaps the main guarantor of world solvency, is some $20 trillion in debt, constantly on the verge of default, and headed by a serial bankruptee who prizes unpredictability. It is little wonder that the worlds citizens might be looking for alternatives. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Governments do not always inspire confidence Bitcoins fans dont entirely distrust human institutions. It is rather that theyd prefer not to need to trust humans to keep their promises, when we know that we humans are deeply fallible. That might seem cynical, but perhaps it is appropriately humble. As Satoshi Nakamoto , the pseudonym for the person or persons who invented Bitcoin, puts it, the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust thats required to make it work. This all helps explain the popularity of Bitcoin as an asset independent of government, mainstream banks and their various shenanigans. But still, is it really worth anything at all? It is based on a blockchain, a technology that creates a decentralized public ledger and rigorously tracks transfers. It is maintained by its users, and no government can mint more coins. Bitcoin isnt backed by any sovereign, and unlike a stock or a bond, it gives you a claim to nothing other than Bitcoin itself. Yet that illusory quality is true of most forms of money, a shared hallucination that we tolerate as long as it works. If enough others value something, that can be enough to make it serve as a store of value. Sure, Bitcoin will crash again, but over its lifetime, it has already withstood multiple crashes, runs and splits. It actually feels tested. This isnt to idealize Bitcoin. Despite its virtual nature, it is still a human institution, facing its own misdeeds and governance problems. Odds are that Bitcoin may never function well as a general medium of exchange (something you can buy things with) because of its wild fluctuations, but might work fine as a store of value that you can sell. It may, like Netscape circa 1995, be portending changes to come. But Bitcoin has captured something. As much as we may love other humans, it is now in code we trust.

The Bitcoinboom during 2020 and so far this year has caused many to be dazzled by the potential gains, ignoring its downside. That is not the case of Bill Gates who, during a talk, explained why cryptocurrency, even being virtual, is a harmful product for the planet. During a recent interview, the Microsoft co-founder highlighted the negative impact that Bitcoin has on the environment. ""Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind,"" Gates told , adding that ""it's not a big climate thing."" The billionaire clarified that if electronic currency were generated from environmentally friendly energy sources, he would change his mind. ""If it's green electricity and it doesn't displace other uses, eventually, you know, maybe that's okay,""Gates said. To avoid a climate disaster, we need to eliminate emissions from the ways we create electricity, grow food, make things, move around, and heat and cool our buildings. It won't be easy, but I believe we can do it. This book is about what it will take.",http://entrepreneur.com/article/366892

They are rare, and are valued at about $0.06. This distinction between ""money"" ""currency"" and what not is all linguistic masturbation.  All things are governed by supply, demand, and free trade exchange rates.  You have a right to your own opinions, but not your own facts. It is impossible, by definition, for bitcoins to be a commodity. A commodity requires a utility outside of the context of a medium of exchange or a store of value; beyond being simply a currency. Not for you, personally, but for someone. Historicly, gold and silver both have (and still do) have utility as jewlery. Presently, silver has industrial utilities, and gold would also if it wasn't valued so much more than other alternatives. Bitcoins can *never* have any utility beyond their use as a medium of exchange or a store of value; and a FRN or a Euro wouldn't even make decent toilet paper. ""The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank...sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world."" - Carroll Quigley, CFR member, mentor to Bill Clinton, from 'Tragedy And Hope'",https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=697.msg8860

Not so fast, say keepers of corporate coffers The cryptocurrency has become inescapable, with big companies like Tesla and individual investors alike rushing to stock up on the digital token. But depending on which study you read, the annual carbon emissions from the electricity required to mine Bitcoin and process its transactions are equal to the amount emitted by all of New Zealand. Or Argentina. To put this into perspective, one Bitcoin transaction is the equivalent to the carbon footprint of 735,121 Visa transactions or 55,280 hours of watching YouTube, according to Digiconomist, which created what it calls a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. (Critics of this comparison point out that the average Bitcoin transaction is worth about $16,000, while the average Visa transaction is worth $46.37, but you get the point.) And as Bitcoin becomes more popular, the more resources its ecosystem consumes.

Here's all you need to know As the resource intensity of running Bitcoin has increased over recent years, it has become a serious concern for its potential impact on health and climate, Alex de Vries, a data scientist who put the index together, wrote in the journal Energy Research & Social Science. All of which raises a crucial question: Does the movement among investors toward companies that rank highly for environmental, social and governance issues pose an existential threat to Bitcoins success? After all, Laurence Fink, chief executive of BlackRock  the largest money manager in the world, with $9 trillion under management  has said that all investments the company makes in the future will be evaluated, in part, on how they plan to meet the climate challenge. Perhaps more important, investors are clamouring for companies to disclose their carbon footprint, and a group called the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures is working on creating a global standard. If thats the case, how will investors view the likes of PayPal, which has been a vocal proponent of climate initiatives  but last fall announced plans to allow customers to conduct transactions in Bitcoin? Or what about Square, the payments company founded by Jack Dorsey? It has become one of the most public proponents of Bitcoin, both dealing with transactions and also keeping the cryptocurrency on its own balance sheet. It holds about 5% of its cash reserves in Bitcoin, whose price has historically been deeply volatile.

The CBN's move to incentivise recipients follows the plummeting of the country's official remittances inflows as recipients opt for non-traditional corridors. 7 hours ago Nigeria to Pay 1.2 Cents for Each Dollar Remitted to the Country to Combat Cryptocurrency Use The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has announced a scheme that seeks to boost international remittances as well as to encourage the use of official corridors when retrieving funds. The CBNs move to incentivise recipients follows the plummeting of the countrys official remittances inflows as recipients opt for non-traditional corridors such as cryptocurrencies. Declining Remittances Under the CBNs so-called naira for dollar scheme, recipients of international remittances will be entitled to an extra payment equivalent to 1.2 cents (5 naira) for every one U.S. dollar received. However, according to the CBN, this incentive scheme is set to run for just 60 days. In announcing these new measures, the CBN says its objective is to increase the inflows of diaspora remittances into the country. In a letter that explains how the incentive system works, the central bank said: In light of this, the CBN shall, commercial banks, pay to remittances recipients the incentive of 5 Naira for every USD 1 remitted by the sender and collected by the designated beneficiary. This incentive is paid to recipients whether they choose to collect the USD as cash across the counter or transfer the same into their domiciliary account. According to the letter, the incentive scheme is set to end on May 8 and officials are confident this will boost the inflow of remittances into the country via the banking ecosystem. Plunging Incoming Remittances As previously reported by news.Bitcoin.com, Nigerias international remittances inflows plunged towards the end of the year 2020. As the datafrom Nairalytics shows, the countrys inflows dropped from the January 2020 high of $2.05 billion to $54.4 million by end of September 2020. Overvalued Exchange Rate The massive drop in remittances via official corridors comes as more Nigerians switchedto companies that use cryptocurrencies when moving funds across borders. Unlike regulated financial institutions that use the official exchange rate, the increasingly popular crypto remittance companies reportedly (before the imposition of the directive) used the parallel exchange rate when converting USD to naira. As the gap between the official and parallel exchange rate increased, inflows via official channels declined while the volumes handled by crypto companies surged. Meanwhile, in its past attempts to halt the decline in the inflows of foreign exchange, the CBN devalued the naira currency three times. The first devaluation was announcedin March of 2020 when the dollar to naira exchange rate moved from 1:307 to 1:360. Four months later, the rate was marginally adjusted to USD1 for 380 nairas. In its last devaluation, the CBN moved the exchange rate to USD1 for 411 nairas. However, according to Abokifx, a website that tracks the parallel market exchange rate, one U.S. dollar was trading for 475 nairas at the time of writing. It remains to be seen if the incentive scheme is going to succeed in returning remittance inflows to past levels. What are your thoughts on CBNs incentive scheme?

30,Bitcoin's Twitter Sentiment at its Most Bearish Since Oct. 1st 2020,ethereumworldnews,"Mar 07, 2021",2021-03-07 15:23:42,"Quick take: Bitcoins Twitter sentiment has taken a nosedive in the month of March BTC Twitter sentiment is at its most bearish since October 1st 2020 However, the approval of a $1.9T stimulus bill might change the tide for Bitcoin Bitcoin has regained the crucial $50k support with the weekly close ahead Bitcoin reclaiming $52k and $55k would return it to bullish territory Twitter sentiment surrounding Bitcoinhas dropped to levels last seen in early October last year. This is according to an observation made by the team at Santiment who also reminded investors that periods of fear and extreme bearishness, are usually the best time to buy back into Bitcoin. Below is their observationof Bitcoins Twitter sentiment alongside a chart demonstrating how low it has dropped this month. In spite of hovering from $46.5k to $52.5k this past week, the sentiment from #Twitter is at its most bearish level since October 1, 2020 today. As weve noted in previous studies, moments of crowd disbelief are commonly the most opportune times to buy with confidence. $1.9T Stimulus Bill is an Advertisement for Bitcoin  Tyler Winklevoss To note is that Bitcoin was trading at $10karound October 1st, and would go on to close 2020 at roughly $28k thus giving weight to the notion that BTC is gearing up for another drive up The idea that now is an opportune time at getting back into Bitcoin is further boosted by the fact that the US Senate approved a $1.9 Trillion stimulus bill that would see individuals get $1,400 checks to cushion them against the financial effects of COVID19. The Co-Founder and CEO of the Gemini Exchange, Tyler Winklevoss was quick to describe the new stimulus bill as a $1.9 Trillion dollar advertisement for Bitcoin as seen in the tweet below. $1.9 trillion dollar advertisement for #bitcoinwas just approved by the Senate",https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoins-twitter-sentiment-at-its-most-bearish-since-oct-1st-2020/
31,"If Everyone Buys Bitcoins, Who Sells?",somagnews,"Mar 06, 2021",2021-03-06 20:38:23,"Some whales have been buying thousands of Bitcoins over the past few weeks. The fact that this demand does not raise the price indicates Naver Some whales have been buying thousands of Bitcoins over the past few weeks. The fact that this demand does not raise the price indicates that large-scale transactions were also carried out on the sales side of the business. A cryptocurrency analyst explained that these transactions may be made by hedge funds. Of course, not everyone is buying Bitcoins. However, looking at the mobility in wallets such as Coinbase Pro and Coinbase Custody, it can be concluded that whales are buying large amounts. According to the analysis of the CryptoQuant CEO, these whales not only buy BTC but also do HODL. Meanwhile, it is known that MicroStrategy continues to grow its balance sheet. The price has been dropping for two weeks Bitcoin price rose 26% in one month. Therefore, it is not correct to say that the purchase made by whales is not reflected in the price at all. However, the price has been falling for two weeks, despite the fact that purchases have not stopped. Who balances and even suppresses this demand on the buy side on the selling side? Short-term whales on the move To answer this question, on-chain analyst Willy Woo looked at the balance changes of Bitcoin addresses and how quickly they were trading. Data from Glassnode shows that wallets with 1,000 to 10,000 Bitcoins are starting to sell. Looking at how the age of the coins in the Bitcoin addresses changes during the sales period, it is seen that most coins are young. These coins were not HODL made for a long time and then sold; It was bought recently and sold in a short time. What could have triggered the sales trend? These on-chain data show that sales transactions may be made by whales who have invested short-term. Although it is not possible to make a definite interpretation as to the reason for this, it is always possible to guess. These coins are sold by hedge funds that have bought BTC in the near term, according to Willy Woos estimates. It is estimated that these funds do not want to take any further risks for Bitcoin, which has already risen to over $ 48,000, and are preparing themselves for the first quarter report. Woos explanation is as follows: Hedge funds started rebalancing their portfolios before the first quarter ended. Most hedge funds; If too much is invested in a single asset, it will be instructed to go for rebalancing and BTC has gained a lot of value lately.

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.

Bitcoins, tulipmania and electric grid insecurity By Peter Pry, opinion contributor       03/05/21 02:30 PM EST The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill &nbsp View Latest Opinions &gt;>  Getty Images Are bitcoins, an electronic cyber currency skyrocketing in value  recently trading above $50,000for a single bitcoin  the next big advancement toward a high-tech future? Or are bitcoins another big vulnerability for electronic civilization, already facing existential threats from nature and man? In 2013, four years after the invention of the bitcoin, the former president of the Dutch Central Bank, Nout Wellink, compared the bitcoin to the ruinous  tulipmania  afflicting Holland 400 years ago. Wellink said bitcoinsare worse than the tulipmania.  At least then you got a tulip; now you get nothing. During the Dutch Golden Age (1600-1720), Holland was a world empire with a mighty navy, the highest per capita income in the world, and the most advanced system of banking, finance and market trading. Tulips, newly introduced to Europe from the Ottoman Empire, became enormously popular, including with Dutch investors. By 1637, paper trading for scarce tulips drove up the price for a single tulip bulb to 50,000 golden guilders, more than a skilled craftsman could earn in 10 years. ADVERTISEMENT In February 1637, at an auction in Haarlem, when no one was willing to pay real golden guilders for real tulip bulbs, the bottom fell out of the market and paper stocks on tulip bulbs became worthless. Modern historians quibble over whether the Dutch tulipmania is historys first example of a burst economic bubble, and over the economic consequences to Holland. But the bottom line is: A single tulip bulb having little intrinsic value, once theoretically worth many times its weight in gold, virtually overnight declined in value by 99.999 percent. Are bitcoins the tulip bulbs of the 21st century? Perhaps not. Japans Satoshi Nakamotoinvented bitcoin as the first digital currency, designed deliberately to be scarce so its value could increase. An estimated 18.6 million bitcoins are circulating out of a maximum supply of 21 million, a number that allegedly cannot grow because this limit is hard-coded into bitcoins, to create artificial scarcity. Arguably, bitcoins, unlike tulip bulbs, have significant intrinsic value. As a cryptocurrency, bitcoins can hide wealth and financial transactions from increasingly snoopy and greedy governments. Moreover, as government deficit spending skyrockets across the world  recklessly printing dollars, pounds and yuan to flood the global money supply  the value of traditional money is threatened by looming hyper-inflation, as is the profitability of investment. Bitcoins have become for the super-rich another hedge against a dystopian future, like gold. However, like gold, even bitcoins can be stolen. Hackers reportedly have stolen billions of dollars in bitcoins in recent years. ADVERTISEMENT In February, the Department of Justices (DOJ) National Security Division chargedNorth Koreas cyber warfare agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, with plotting to steal over $1 billion in cash and bitcoins. North Korean hackers Jon Chang Hyok, Kim Il and Park Jin Hyok are accused by the DOJ of stealing tens of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency, and DOJ calls them the worlds leading bank robbers. According to the United Nations, North Korean cryptocurrency thefts are helping to fundPyongyangs nuclear weapons and missile programs. Bitcoins may not be a good investment, or a good hedge against a dystopian future, when national electric grids and electronic civilization may be on the brink of a new Dark Age. The Biden administration claims the recent ice storm that crippled the Texas electric grid  causing statewide rolling blackouts, depriving water and heat to millions and inflicting property damage and deaths  is a harbinger of catastrophic climate change. If true, so-called green energy windmills and solar panels, alleged solutions to climate change, proved most vulnerable to the challenge of an unusual, but not unprecedented, Texas ice storm.  Nuclear and coal-fired power plants were least affected. Climate change is not the cause of what may be remembered as the great Texas blackout of 2021, which really was the result of politics. In 2017, the congressionally mandated Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Commission warned: Current institutional arrangements for protecting and improving the reliability of the electric grids  has proven to be ineffectual because the power industry is largely self-regulated. For example, Texas and California electric utilities failed to take commonsense precautionsto protect themselves from severe weather. Federal and state governments are letting electric utilities cause deadly California wildfires and an ice age in Texas, essentially getting away with murder. Government policy that trusts electric utilities to protect the nation from existential threats such as EMP and cyber warfare ultimately could prove to be genocidal, killing millions. Maybe the super-rich do not care about the lives of 330 million Americans. But if financial wizards do not want their bitcoins to become as worthless as tulip bulbs, they should use their great political influence to advance policies that protect the national electric grid. As the EMP Commission warned: An EMP attack that disrupts the financial services industry would, in effect, stop the operation of the U.S. economy.  The alternative to a disrupted electronic economy may not be reversion to a 19th century cash economy, but reversion to an earlier economy based on barter. Will the recent SolarWinds cyber attackand Texas ice storm result in real protection for electric grids, or just more studies? Russia, China, North Korea and Iran are watching.

Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed zero worries about inflation during an interview at a Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit on Thursday. Powell didnt explain when the easy-money policies would end and after his commentary, U.S. bonds and stocks saw a massive sell-off. The US Fed Juggles Shaky Treasury Yields and Easy-Money Policies On March 3, 2021, Reuters reportedon how the benchmark 10-year U.S. note saw some steep declines for three days straight ahead of the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell interview at the summit. But then Treasury bond yields spiked, which gave market investors the impression that easy-money policies would be stifled. Moreover, Fed Governor Lael Brainarddiscussed the concerning bond yields before Powells summit interview as well. This was after the fact that Powell sat in front of the Senate Banking Committee and the Chairman dismissed Treasury yield concerns. Jerome Powell showed no signs of stopping the easy-money policies the Federal Reserve has put into place since well before the first Covid-19 outbreak in the United States. The following day, Powell exchanged dialogue with Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporters and again shrugged off the worry over Treasury yields. Stocks and Bonds sold off almost immediately in a market downturn, as Nasdaq was down -274, NYSE -239, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average -345. Powells lack of concern and his commentary in regard to the Treasury yields and inflation was highlighted in a WSJ reportthat followed the Fed Chairmans statements. We expect that as the economy reopens and hopefully picks up, we will see inflation move up through base effects, Powell saidduring the conference. That could create some upward pressure on prices. Today were still a long way from our goals of maximum employment and inflation averaging 2% over time. Wed want to see inflation sustainably above 2% and wed want to be on track for inflation to run sustainably above 2%, Powell added. Without the market getting reassurance from the Fed Chairman, participants sold treasuries and equities at a rapid rate. On Thursday gold spot prices and futures took a small percentage dip following the bond sell-off. Interestingly, Powells statements affecting the market negatively, also seemingly trickled into precious metals and cryptocurrency markets as well. Gold prices were down on March 4, to $1,693 per ounce and silver prices were also down to $25 an ounce. Bitcoin ( BTC ) also dropped close to 5% on Thursday afternoon (New York Time) to the $46k range by the evening trading sessions. BTChas regained some momentum on Friday morning as the price nears the $48k zone again. Billions of dollars in value were also shaved off the crypto-economyon Thursday as BTCdropped from $51k to above $48k during the early morning trading sessions, and then to $46.5k by the evening trading sessions (ET). 24-hour stats show bitcoin ( BTC ) lost around 9% since Powells statements. Despite the market sell-off, particularly in the precious metals (PMs) arena, the Crescat Capital portfolio manager Otavio (Tavi) Costabelieves that PMs will see a secular bull market. Furthermore, Costa shows how the Feds irresponsible monetary habits leave the central bank in a trapped position. Crescat Capital portfolio manager Otavio (Tavi) Costa explains that the U.S. Federal Reserve is trapped and has no choice but to issue a massive amount of Treasuries in weeks to come. The Fed is trapped, Costa says. The year is just getting started and US fiscal deficits already reached another record. Now at its worst level in 70 years. The current fiscal spending path will lead to record Treasury issuance this year, the Crescat executive insists. First off, Costas Twitter threadexplains that U.S. fiscal deficits are at their worst level in 70 years. So horrible in fact, that Costa thinks this will spur a record Treasury issuance this year. He noted how the Fed alongside U.S. lawmakers already stacked up $2.2 trillion with the CARES Act bill. Then, an additional $900 billion of stimulus in December, Costa says. With the decline in tax revenues and other discretionary and non-discretionary outlays, the government had to issue $4.4 trillion of net new debt in 2020 to fund these programs, the portfolio manager adds. To fund this operation, the Fed purchased $2.4 trillion of these Treasuries or 54% of the total issuance. Equating to an average of $197 billion per month. Costa added: In 2021, if the Fed decides to stick with the $80 billion/month plan, it would be 60% less than what they did last year. The math does not add up. Fiscal spending is likely to be significantly higher. The Biden administration is now planning on a two-stage stimulus package: rescue and recovery. The rescue will be close to $1.9T. Bidens Recovery Package Needs to Pass Soon, U.S. Federal Net Receipts Roll Over With all the Feds cards on the table, Bidens recovery package needs to be passed in the coming weeks before unemployment benefit programs are exhausted of money. In other words: A tsunami of Treasury issuances is likely underway, Costa said. He also highlighted that U.S. Federal net receipts are rolling over which is putting the Fed in another pickle. The Crescat executive believes that foreign investors and U.S. banks wont be able to fund all this debt. The ball is clearly on the Feds court, Costa insisted. The government cannot afford this money party to stop, Costa emphasizes. This is not like the disinflationary times we had after the global financial crisis. It is quite the opposite. Today, we have inflationary pressures on both the demand and supply side of the economy. Its about fiscal recklessness. Massive debt buildup. Monetary dilution to suppress interest rates. Lack of fundamentally cheap assets that yield more than inflation. A worsening current account deficit issue () Because the American populace continues to allow financial irresponsibility, the current and the next generations of U.S. taxpayers will pay the toll for these debts In our analysis Costa writes. The Fed will have no choice but to substantially increase its planned quantitative easing. After all, the central bank is the lender of last resort. But U.S. taxpayers will also be on the hook. Throughout history, an increase in income tax rates tends to follow a period of large government spending. It is only a matter of time until this becomes an even more discussed topic, the Crescat analyst details. Even though Powell told the markets the lies he assumed everyone wanted to hear, the bond market vigilantes didn't believe him. His inflation denial is no longer credible. He may be forced to tell the truth. Admit inflation is",https://news.bitcoin.com/the-fed-is-trapped-erratic-bond-markets-exhausted-supplies-analyst-says-tsunami-of-treasury-issuances-underway/
36,NFTs Explained: What They Are and Why They're Selling for Millions of Dollars,singularityhub,"Mar 05, 2021",2021-03-05 15:00:35,"NFTs bring code and culture together to create a form of control that doesnt rely on the law or sabotaging existing systems. Mar 05, 2021 0 A couple of days ago, the musician Grimes sold some animationsshe made with her brother Mac on a website called Nifty Gateway. Some were one-offs, while others were limited editions of a few hundred snapped up in about 20 minutes, with total takings of more than $6 million. Despite the steep price tag, anybody can watch or (with a simple right-click) save a copy of the videos, which show a cherub ascending over Mars Earth and imaginary landscapes Rather than a copy of the files themselves, the eager buyers received a special kind of tradable certificate called a non-fungible token or NFT. But what they were really paying for was an aura of authenticity and the ability to one day sell that aura of authenticity to somebody else. NFTs are a cultural answer to creating technical scarcity on the internet, and they allow new types of digital goods. They are making inroads into the realms of high art rock music,and even new mass-markets of virtual NBA trading cards In the process, they are also making certain people rich How NFTs Work NFTs are digital certificates that authenticate a claim of ownership to an asset, and allow it to be transferred or sold. The certificates are secured with blockchaintechnology similar to what underpins Bitcoinand other cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is a decentralized alternative to a central database Blockchains usually store information in encrypted form across a peer-to-peer network, which makes them very difficult to hack or tamper with. This in turn makes them useful for keeping important records. The key difference between NFTs and cryptocurrencies is that currencies allow fungible trade, which means anyone can create Bitcoins that can be exchanged for other Bitcoins. NFTs are by definition non-fungible, and are deployed as individual chains of ownership to track a specific asset. NFTs are designed to uniquely restrict and represent a unique claim on an asset. And heres where things get weird. Often, NFTs are used to claim ownership of a digital asset that is otherwise completely copiable, pastable, and shareable such as a movie, JPEG, or other digital file. So What Is an Authentic Original Digital Copy? Online, its hard to say what authenticity and ownership really mean. Internet culture and the internet itself have been driven by copying, pasting, and remixing to engender new forms of authentic creative work At a technical level, the internet is precisely a system for efficiently and openlytaking a string of ones and zeros from this computer and making them accessible on that computer, somewhere else. Content available online is typically what economists call  non-rivalrous goods , which means that one person watching or sharing or remixing a file doesnt in any way impede other people from doing the same. Constant sharing adds up to a near-infinite array of material to view, share, copy, or remix into something new, creating the economies of abundanceon which online culture thrives. TikTok is built around reimagining common audio loops with seemingly endless but unique accompanying visual rituals which are themselves mimicked in seemingly endless variations. On Twitter, tweets are only valuable to the extent they are retweeted. Fake news only exists insofar as Facebooks algorithmdecides sharing it will increase engagement via driving more sharing. Information Wants to Be Free The life and longevity of digital content has depended on its ability to spread The internets pioneering cyber-libertarians had a motto to describe this: information wants to be free Attempts to stop information spreading online have historically required breaking aspects of technology (like encryption)or legal regimeslike copyright. NFTs, however, bring code and culture together to create a form of control that doesnt rely on the law or sabotaging existing systems. They create a unique kind of authenticity in an otherwise shareable world. Whats Next? consensual hallucination  in which billions of users agreed that the online world was real. NFTs take this to the next level: theyre a consensual hallucination that this string of ones and zeros is different and more authentic than that (identical) string of ones and zeros. NFTs work by reintroducing a mutual hallucination of scarcity into a world of abundance. There is no shortage of buyers: the NFT market is already worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Even humble sports trading cardswill never be the same. Are NFTs Different Enough to Break the Internet? The real function of NFTs is to create a clear delineation between ordinary creators and consumers of online content and those privileged enough to be paid to produce content or claim to own authentic work. The internet decentralized content creation, but NFTs are trying to recentralize the distribution of culture. NFTs facilitate the exchange of fungible money for non-fungible authenticity. Its a well-known movethat occurs in all sorts of industries, and one with a long history in, well, art history How the culture-code of NFTs will evolve is anyones guess but at the moment, it is opening a lot of new ways to make new moneychange hands. At first take, it might seem that this presents artists everywhere with a recourse to get paid for their otherwise copy-pastable work. Yet creating normative rules around paying for content online has not so far gone smoothly: think of the lackluster paymentsmusicians receive from streaming services like Spotify. NFTs have also been criticizedfor their profligate energy consumption, because they depend on a lot of computer power to encrypt their tokens. According to the online calculator at CryptoArt the computations required to create NFTs for each of Grimes animations would have used enough electricity to boil a kettle 1.5 million times and resulted in around 70 tons of CO 2 emissions. Im not sure that cost for future generations was priced into the current market value, or any appreciation as tokens cryptographically change hands. Other than their tons of CO 2 emissions, whats real about NFTs is how their creation of technical scarcity enables a new cultural agreement about how something can be authentic and who controls that authenticity. NFTs create new forms of hierarchy, power, and exclusion on the wider web. They have already created a new type of haves and have-nots.

Where online casinos in Canada accept cryptocurrencies, the digital currency of choice tends to be Bitcoin. However, you can sometimes find alternative options, including Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Litecoin and Tether (USDT), at no small number of top Canadian betting sites. Some even accept deposits made using a variety of these options. If you opt to have a crack at playing your favourite games with cryptocurrencies at a Canadian online casino, we recommend choosing one that also accepts FIAT currencies. This way, you can ease yourself into betting with Bitcoins (or other options) slowly. The Advantages to Cryptocurrency Gameplay at Canadian Casinos There are several advantages to betting with cryptocurrencies at Canadian casinos. One of the most notable ones is that you can expect a degree of anonymity, thanks to blockchain technology. At the same time, cryptocurrency withdrawals also tend to be processed faster than with most conventional casino withdrawal options, including, in some cases, e-wallets. The fees associated with cryptocurrency cashouts at Canadas top casinos tend to be low if there are any at all. The withdrawal limits are also relatively high, allowing you more wiggle room to cash out your winnings than are afforded by some rival payment providers. Wagering on Canadian Casino Games with Cryptocurrencies If you decide to wager with cryptocurrencies at Canadian casinos, make sure that you pick the right casino. Some casinos only accept deposits and withdrawals with Bitcoin and convert your cash into Canadian dollars for gameplay. You want to avoid this, as it means lower conversion rates and possible charges. Instead, opt to play at a Canadian casino that actively allows you to wager on games using BTC, ETH and other cryptocurrencies. These sites do exist, but you will need to read top Canadian casino reviews to make sure that you sign up at one that offers this service.

However, he is still worried that governments can outlaw bitcoin if it becomes a viable currency. 2 days ago Jim Rogers Regrets Not Buying Bitcoin but Warns Governments May Outlaw Cryptocurrencies Renowned investor Jim Rogers, who co-founded the Quantum Fund with billionaire investor George Soros, now regrets not buying bitcoin. However, he is still worried that governments can outlaw bitcoin if it becomes a viable currency. Jim Rogers Bitcoin Regret Jim Rogers said in an interview with Real Vision this week that he wished he had bought bitcoin years ago. Rogers is George Soros former business partner and the co-founder of the Quantum Fund and Soros Fund Management. He believes that bonds are in a bubble and expects the prices of gold and silver to skyrocket. As for bitcoin, he said: I wish I had bought bitcoin. I will point out that many cryptocurrencies have already disappeared and gone to zero. We all hear about bitcoin. We dont hear about the dozens that dont exist anymore. The price of bitcoin has surged about 54% this year, 612% since the beginning of last year, and 1,152% since the start of 2019. Surpassing previous all-time highs multiple times this year, the BTCprice is currently $46,577 at the time of writing with a market capitalization of $871 billion, based on data from markets.Bitcoin.com. s price chart over several years. Source: markets.Bitcoin.com Jim Rogers Warns Government May Outlaw Cryptocurrencies However, Rogers is still in the mindset that governments will not let cryptocurrency flourish if it succeeds as a currency. In June last year, news.Bitcoin.com reported that the veteran investor warned that governments will stop cryptocurrencywhile discussing bitcoin being used as money. During his interview with Real Vision this week, he was quoted as saying: If bitcoin ever becomes a viable currency instead of a trading vehicle, they can outlaw it. Governments dont want to lose control. They like their monopoly. Do you think theyre going to say, OK, here are US dollars, and theyre on the computer, but if you want to use something else, you can? Thats actually not my experience with governments at any time in history. Popular television personality and bitcoin proponent Max Keiser has predicted that when the BTCprice reaches $50K, Rogers will go all-inon bitcoin, as will Shark Tanks Mark Cuban and gold bug Peter Schiff. While Rogers is now regretting his decision not to invest in bitcoin earlier, Schiff still insists that the value of the cryptocurrency could fall to zero. Nonetheless, he has admitted that it can also reach $100K Rogers is also not confident in the U.S. dollar. In September last year, he predicted the end of the dollar dominance Rogers is not the only person who has warned about governments stopping cryptocurrency. Harvard Professor Kenneth Rogoff has repeatedly said that governments and central banks will never allowbitcoin to go mainstream and he thinks they will win Dan Nathan, the founder of Risk Reversal Advisors, saidthat the U.S. government will not keep allowing corporations like Elon Musks Tesla to replace the dollars in their balance sheets with bitcoin. Another investor who strongly warned about regulators coming down hard on cryptocurrencies is Shark Tank star Kevin OLeary, aka Mr. Wonderful. Grown men are going to weep when that happens. You will never see a loss of capital like that ever in your life. It will be brutal, he said However, he changed his mind after the approval of two bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Canada. OLeary is now a bitcoin investor and believes that cryptocurrencies are here to stay What do you think about Jim Rogers bitcoin regret and warning?

He has made a case that bitcoin is better than gold, telling gold bug Peter Schiff to ""move on"" because ""gold is dead."" ETH are technologies that can make you a banker, allow friction free exchange of value and are extensible into an unlimited range of biz and personal applications. Schiff swiftly replied: Mark, a lot of your athletes wear gold jewelry. Ask them why. Gold has many uses outside of jewelry that contribute to its value as a metal. Its not hyped at all. Gold is money. Bitcoin is 100% hype. Its nothing. The Shark Tank star further argued: What we are seeing built w/crypto today is just proof of concept. As tech continues to get better/cheaper/faster there will be new applications and maybe even something that supersedes what we know as crypto today. He proceeded to compare crypto to gold. But gold wont ever change. Which is why it will die as a SOV [store of value], Cuban told Schiff. In addition, he emphasized: Dont forget, gold was a SOV built on technology. From picks and shovels to mining operations that keep trying to improve. Whoever could use the tech of the day to find and mine the most efficiently was the most rewarded. Much like crypto is today. The Dallas Mavericks owner concluded: Gold is dead Peter. Move on. Refusing to concede, Schiff insisted that gold is superior to bitcoin. He even commented in a separate tweet that Cuban should have stuck with bananas, stating that the Shark Tank star only changed his mind because the price went up and more people were foolish enough to buy it. There is no new information. Its the same bubble it always was, only bigger. Cuban used to be a bitcoin skeptic, preferring bananas to bitcoin because he claimed he could at least eat a banana. Responding to a comment on Twitter about his previous stance on BTC Cuban explained: What I said a couple of years ago was that it wasnt a currency and didnt have any immediate utility. Unlike a banana that I could eat. He further clarified: What has changed is De-Fi. Now",https://news.bitcoin.com/mark-cuban-bitcoin-better-than-gold-peter-schiff-gold-is-dead/

The amount for a vehicle deposit is based on current market rates, with the value of Teslas cars still set in USD. Tesla will send a confirmation once the payment is received, and, presto, youve got yourself a brand new EV. This process will allow customers to purchase any one of Teslas electric four-wheelers, including the Model S, 3, X (above) and Y, plus the Cybertruckand the second-generation Roadster, both of which are slated to arrive this year. For now, the new payment method is only available in the US, but Musk did add that he plans to offer it to other markets later this year.

Over the past hour, the cryptocurrency has risen in price by $ 1.7 thousand , to the current level of $ 55.4 thousand. Tesla announced its intention to add the ability to pay with cryptocurrency to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early February. The company announced this when it disclosed its $ 1.5 billion investment in bitcoin. The American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase helped the automaker buy the cryptocurrency. Musk stated that Tesla's actions do not directly reflect his views, since he considers Bitcoin 'simply a less stupid form of liquidity than cash savings.'

45,Elon Musk announces that Tesla cars can now be bought with bitcoins in the US  Pledge Times,pledgetimes,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 08:55:52,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk intervenes via video at an event in Beijing last week.WU HONG / EFEThe CEO of Tesla, Tesla CEO Elon Musk intervenes via video at an event in Beijing last week. WU HONG / EFE The CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, announced this Wednesday that those interested in buying a car of the brand can now use bitcoins to do so. The news came without statements of no appearances. He did it in the purest Musk style, with a brief message on the social network Twitter (his favorite means of expression), after two in the morning in the United States. His eight words traveled quickly through the web propelled by his nearly 50 million followers, many of whom idolize him as a visionary. You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin  Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2021 In another tweet, Musk clarified that for now the measure is limited only to the United States. In the rest of the world, customers will have to wait to get one of their electric vehicles using cryptocurrency as a means of payment, but the intention of the firm is that they can do so this year. The passage of Tesla revolutionizes its commercial policy. And it turns its car prices into a constantly fluctuating liquid element. The most expensive version of its model X costs, according to its website, $ 113,190 (about 96,000 euros), which currently amounts to slightly more than two bitcoins. However, if within a month the price of bitcoin were reduced by half (something not ruled out considering the history of extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency) the amount entered by Tesla would fall in the same proportion, and would be the equivalent of the client having disbursed $ 56,595. In contrast, if bitcoin doubled in price, Tesla would have received $ 226,380 for that car. The news is not a surprise. Tesla already announced at the beginning of February that it would allow bitcoins to be used to buy its cars, but had not specified the date when it would start billing in that way. That day, the company also announced that it had acquired 1.25 billion euros in bitcoins to maximize the return on cash that it does not need in the short term, a very profitable investment for now, given that the price of the cryptocurrency is around historical highs. The automaker now aims to further increase its exposure to bitcoin, as it has explained that it will not convert the payments it receives from its customers in cryptocurrencies into dollars. Some predicted that Teslas announcement could provoke a cascade of companies that would follow in his footsteps and begin to admit it as a means of payment. So far that has not happened. And analysts believe that the excessive volatility of the cryptocurrency will continue to cause large corporations to reject its use. Musk began his public love affair with bitcoin in December, when he sent its price skyrocketing just by including the cryptocurrencys name in his Twitter bio description. The Tesla boss now takes his faith much further by accepting it as a means of payment, thus ignoring warnings from various central banks about bitcoin, which they consider a high-risk speculative asset. Supported by expectations of an increase in the use of electric cars, Tesla is worth 635,000 million dollars on the stock market today, 555% more than a year ago, a revaluation has made Musk the second richest man in the world after the founder of Amazon , Jeff Bezos. Teslas decision to authorize the payment with bitcoins now caused the price of bitcoin to rise this Wednesday. After nine in the morning it was exchanged for more than $ 56,000, an increase of 5%. #Elon #Musk #announces #Tesla #cars #bought #bitcoins",https://pledgetimes.com/elon-musk-announces-that-tesla-cars-can-now-be-bought-with-bitcoins-in-the-us/

49,What are NFTs and why are people paying millions for them?,nationalpost,"Mar 23, 2021",2021-03-23 21:33:05,"THE CONVERSATION What are NFTs and why are people paying millions for them? Back to video Author: Laleh Samarbakhsh, Associate Professor, Finance, Ryerson University Last week, Christies sold a digital collage of images called Everydays: The First 5000 Days for US$69.3 million dollars. This week, Elon Musk said hes selling a tweet of his as an NFT, which contains a song about NFTs. The bidding on Musks tweet has already topped $1 million and millions more are pouring into the market  he has since tweeted, Actually, doesnt feel quite right selling this. Will pass. And sites like NBA Top Shot (where you can buy, sell and trade digital NBA cards) have individual cards selling for over US$200,000. It might sound ridiculous but the explosive market of crypto-collectibles and crypto-art is no joke. I investigate cryptocurrencies and have academic publications on Bitcoin markets. To help you understand what an NFT is and why theyre becoming so popular, heres an explainer to make sense of it all. What is an NFT? A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital file with verified identity and ownership. This verification is done using blockchain technology. Blockchain technology, simply put, is an un-hackable system based on the mathematics of cryptography. So, thats why you hear a lot of crypto when referring to NFTs  crypto-art, crypto-collectibles, etc. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content What is fungibility? Fungibility is the ability of an asset to be interchanged with other individual assets of the same kind; it implies equal value between the assets. If you own a fungible asset you can readily interchange it for another of a similar kind. Fungible assets simplify the exchange and trade processes, and the best example would be (you guessed it) money. Is NFT the same as Bitcoin? This is where I can explain and emphasize the non-fungibility property of NFTs. The main difference between NFTs and Bitcoins is the fact that Bitcoins are limited, and fungible (you can trade one Bitcoin with another and both have the same value and price). NFTs are unique but unlimited, and non-fungible (no two artworks are the same). While NFTs can appreciate in value (just like real estate), they cannot be interchanged for another NFT. What does this mean for the future of money? While not directly related to NFTs, its important to mention some properties of money. Among many properties, money has to be fungible (one unit is viewed as interchangeable as another), and divisible (can be divided into smaller units of value). NFTs are not fungible nor (easily) divisible. For example, a single dollar is easily convertible into four quarters or ten dimes, but currently you cannot divide one NFT (although the blockchain technology behind may allow it in future). In fact, fungibility and divisibility are part of five requirements for a currency to exist in a regulated economy. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Why are NFTs being valued? The importance of NFTs lies in providing the ability to securely value, purchase and exchange digital art using a digital ledger. NFTs started in online gaming, later with Nikes patenting of its authenticity (CryptoKicks) and then by the famous Christies auction embracing NFT valuation of a digital art piece. NFTs are commonly created by uploading files, such as digital artwork, to an auction market. Just like any other form of art, NFTs are not mutually interchangeable, making them more like collectible items. The platform (typically Ethereum) allows the digital art to be tokenized and for the ownership to be safely stored using a decentralized, open-source blockchain (that is, anyone can check the ledger), featuring smart contract functionality. This means the traditional role of a middle man for selling the art is now digitized. Is owning the NFTs the same as owning the copyright? No, owning the NFT doesnt grant you the copyright to the art; they are distinct from one another. The ownership of the NFT is established using a digital ledger, which anyone can access because it is stored openly. This ledger tracks who owns an NFT and ensures that the NFT cant be duplicated or tampered with, essentially a smart contract. What does the future hold for NFTs? It is undeniable that digital assets and blockchain technology are changing the future of trade. As a result, NFTs are also at the helm of this positive growth. However, just like other examples in history (e.g. the Dutch Tulip, the dotcom bubble, etc.), certain valuations may see the need for future corrections depending on socio-economic desires and the chance of a bubble. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Every generation has its own niche attachment to certain valuations whether for vanity or other reasons. NFTs are currently very popular among younger generations, but whether this generation will have the economic power to purchase or find use for them in the future, is both a social and economic question. For NFTs the true potential is yet to be uncovered. Whether big industry players in art, design or fashion will buy into it or not is also yet to be seen. One thing is for sure, NFTs did open the door for many digital artists to be identified and valued, and the smart contract functionalities of the blockchain technology will be used in future valuations of many assets.

He has become more bullish on bitcoin, advising investors to put 5% of their portfolios in the cryptocurrency to protect their assets. 6 hours ago Mad Moneys Jim Cramer Says Gold Let Him Down, Put 5% in Bitcoin Mad Money host Jim Cramer, a long-term gold proponent, says that gold has let him down. He has become more bullish on bitcoin, advising investors to put 5% of their portfolios in the cryptocurrency to protect their assets. Jim Cramer Reduces Gold Holdings, Increases Bitcoin Allocation In an interviewpublished Monday with Morgan Creek Digital partner Anthony Pompliano, Jim Cramer talked about his new investment strategy for bitcoin and gold. Cramer is the host of Mad Money on CNBC, a former hedge fund manager, and a co-founder of Thestreet.com, a financial news and literacy website. Emphasizing that bitcoin is what he had been searching for with gold, Cramer opined: I have, for years, said that you should have gold  but gold let me down. Gold is subject to too many vicissitudes. Its subject to mining issues. Its frankly subject to failing in many cases. The Mad Money host became interested in bitcoin after Pompliano explained the benefits of the cryptocurrency to him in September last year. At the time, Cramer revealed that he owned so much gold. He became fixated with BTCin fear of massive inflationand he subsequently investedin the crypto. He explained that his investment strategywas to regard bitcoin as a precious stock. Cramer was then asked if he expects other investors will dump gold and buy bitcoin in the way he described. The Mad Money host exclaimed: If they listen to me, theyre going to drop half their gold. Ive been saying 10% in gold since 1983. And now I say 5% in gold, 5% in bitcoin. He clarified that he did not think about investing 5% of his portfolio in bitcoin until very recently, claiming that he has thoroughly researched the subject to come up with this recommendation. He admitted that he was skeptical because he had done fine with his gold but now realized that the only way to protect his assets, in terms of insurance, is with bitcoin.

One critical gauge shows the cryptocurrencys expected price swings are now at their lowest point in three months. The cryptocurrencys implied volatility, or expectations for price turbulence, declined to an annualized 75% early Monday, based on calculations using options premiums with a one-month horizon. Thats the lowest since Dec. 25, according to data provider Skew. They peaked above 145% in mid-January. The declining trend suggests that markets are expecting sideways price action, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at trading sentiment data provider Trade the Chain, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. Bitcoin is currently stuck in a narrowing price range, with both bulls and the bears unwilling to lead, as seen below.

A put option is a derivative contract that gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. At press time, one-, three-, and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, are at negative values, indicating greater demand for call options or bullish bets. Also read: This Ether Options Play by Institutions Has Lottery Ticket Potential The market bias for calls would strengthen if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the narrowing price range with strong spot market volumes, opening the doors for substantial gains above $60,000.On the flip side, a range breakdown may invite stronger chart-driven selling pressure, leading a deeper pullback. According toone analyst, the cryptocurrency could drop to $47,000 if the support at $55,000 is breached. A prolonged period of below-average volatility often paves the way for violent price action on either side. However, thats not the case right now. While the implied volatility has come off sharply from its January highs, its still hovering near its lifetime average.

Terence Zimwara 4 hours ago Central Bank of Nigeria Official Reiterates Nigerian Residents Free to Trade Cryptos: Directive Only Applies to Banking Sector A senior executive with Nigerias central bank, Adamu Lamtek, has reportedly denied that his institution had placed restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies. Instead, Lamtek, who is the deputy governor responsible for corporates services at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), says his organisations directive only applies to the banking sector. Prohibition Only Applies to Banks The remarksby Lamtek, who spoke on behalf of the CBN governor Godwin Emefiele, follow the central banks February 5, 2021, directivewhich prohibited banks from facilitating crypto-related transactions. Immediately following the announcement, financial institutions began to comply with the directive. Since then volumes on centralized crypto exchanges have plunged while reports suggest that volumes on peer to peer platforms are on the rise In the meantime, before the latest communication from the CBN, rumours circulated that authorities would soon clampdown on peer to peer trading like Binances P2P platform. However, Lamtek, who spoke at a seminar for the countrys finance correspondents and business editors, clarified that the CBN directive did not in fact ban cryptocurrency trading. Meanwhile, after the CBN ordered banks to stop facilitating crypto transactions, many leaders from Nigerias blockchain and fintech space reacted by expressing their opposition. One of these leaders, Adedayo Adedajo, the Managing Director at Jerulida Africa DLT, tells Bitcoin.com News that after extensive deliberations, many were in favour of regulating the industry rather than a total ban. CBN Has No Power to Stop P2P Trading As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, this CBN prohibition has been opposed by non-crypto parties that include members of the Nigerian Senateas well as the countrys Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Now, according to Adebajo, this latest CBN stance on cryptocurrencies could well be a response to the voices that are opposed to a complete ban. Adebajo said: Lets not forget that the initial attempt only scratched the surface a bit as trading continues on the peer to peer platforms despite the CBN directives. Allowing trades to continue cant be said to be subject to CBNs power anymore as the financial sector has partially been decentralized. While the CBN is not in a position to stop peer-to-peer trading, Adebajo however believes this latest clarification to be a way forward one which we all hope with continuous effort to regulate the industry, adoption will be broad and fast.

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.

58,Prosecutor: Alleged money launderer Ian Freeman holds $1.6 million in Bitcoins,yahoo,"Mar 20, 2021",2021-03-20 08:07:00,"Mar. 20CONCORD  Free-Keene leader Ian Freeman has accessed $1.66 million worth of Bitcoins and had $178,000 in cash in his safe when his house was raided... Ian Freeman Mar. 20CONCORD  Free-Keene leader Ian Freeman has accessed $1.66 million worth of Bitcoins and had $178,000 in cash in his safe when his house was raided by federal authorities this week, prosecutors said on Friday. Federal prosecutors also said Freeman has access to gold, silver, and possibly other liquid assets and cryptocurrencies. Freeman  who faces eight felony charges including money laundering, wire fraud and conspiracy  could tap those assets and use them to flee if a judge releases him on bail, prosecutors warned. Assistant U.S. Attorney Georgina MacDonald voiced those concerns during an hour-plus bail hearing streamed live Friday from U.S. District Court in Concord. The hearing ended with Judge Magistrate Andrea Johnstone deferring a decision and promising a written order as soon as possible. On Tuesday, the FBI arrested Freeman and five others who are part of the libertarian Free Keene movement on charges related to a Bitcoin-dollar exchange system they ran through churches they were closely affiliated with. Freeman is the only one to face charges of money laundering and operating a continuing financial crimes enterprise, which call for mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years. MacDonald termed Freeman a sophisticated cybercriminal. Close to 70 people, including media, FBI agents and some with cryptic names, logged on for the hearing. Freeman participated via video feed from Merrimack County jail. Veteran defense lawyer Mark Sisti said his client is a perfect example of someone who should be released on bail. Sisti said Freeman has only three felony arrests on his record, dating back 8 to 11 years ago. He's not charged with a violent crime or drug dealing. He faces a novel prosecution in New Hampshire that will be lengthy and complex. And he's known for years of the FBI investigation because people that agents interviewed would tell him. ""If he chose to leave the jurisdiction for fear of being charged, he'd be gone by now,"" Sisti said. Story continues MacDonald said most of the other co-defendants have been released. While authorities have confiscated the cash they found at his house, they do not have access to his 28 Bitcoins, MacDonald said. She said Freeman used accounts set up for the Shire Free Church, where he is paid as the minister, to convert dollars that others acquired from romance fraud, investment fraud and your-friend's-in-jail fraud to Bitcoin. He offered anonymity, didn't ask questions and charged a 10% exchange fee; legitimate exchange services charge 3% or less, she said. On the day of the FBI raid, in fact, Shire Free Church received an exchange request from a person who had bilked an 80-year-old woman of $4,000 in a romance scam, MacDonald said. ""His release places many victims at risk of financial harm,"" MacDonald said.

At one point during their meeting, Ballar Fallas took a phone call and, moments later, two assailants approached the table and shot both men dead from close range. Ballar Fallas then calmly got up, walked out of the restaurant, and disappeareduntil now.According to reports from Mexico, Ballar Fallas was arrested on Thursday for allegedly masterminding the killing of the two men. The pair, Alon Azulay and Benjamin Yeshurun Sutchi, were reportedly in Mexico City to collect a $14.5 million money laundering debt that she had with them. But the shady deal was entangled with Mexico Citys brutal cartels, and the men were aware they were in danger ahead of the meeting.Messages on cellphones recovered at the scenea restaurant at the luxury Plaza Arts Mallreportedly revealed that the victims only agreed to meet in person if it all happened in a busy public place. Ballar Fallas reserved the table where Azulay and Sutchi were shot and was there to meet them before all hell broke loose in the building. Cellphone video of the incident showed panicked diners hiding under tables from the gunfire.Este es un recuento de los hechos ocurridos en la plaza Artz al sur de la #CDMX. @AztecaNoticias #EsDeMaana con @AlejandroBrofft y @luigicantu | https://t.co/aTkQJpFqLg pic.twitter.com/XUM5nuGudu adn40 (@adn40) July 28, 2019 Ballar Fallas, known by the moniker La Gera, is believed by investigators to have lured Sutchi and Azulay to the restaurant with the promise of giving them millions of dollars of laundered money. In a Friday statement, the Mexico City Attorney Generals Office reportedly described her as a trusted partner of the leadership of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been blamed for organizing the assassinations.The newspaper El Universal reported that the Jalisco New Generation Cartel had attempted to use the two Israelis to launder the millions but came to believe that the two werent going to give them their share, so allegedly arranged the hit job using Ballar Fallas and hired guns.At the time of the murders, the shooters were named as Esperanza Gutierrez, a 33-year-old woman, and 23-year-old male Mauricio Hiram. They are both believed to have belonged to the Tlhuac Cartel, which is reportedly allied with the larger Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Gutierrez was arrested moments after the July 2019 hit, whereas Hiram wasnt tracked down and arrested until September of that year.Israels embassy in Mexico said the two dead men had previous criminal records in both Israel and Mexico, and Mexican police have noted that the evidence suggested that the shooting was linked to a financial dispute between criminal groups with connections to the Israeli mafia.The event yesterday leads us to relate the facts with a settling of scores among criminal groups and/or organized crime, Ulses Lara Lpez, a spokesman for the city prosecutors office, said in 2019. It could be a settling of scores in the Israeli mafia, which is why a complete identification [of the victims] was possible, along with their criminal records.In August 2019, Mexico asked Interpol for help in finding Ballar Fallas. On Thursday, a year and eight months after she allegedly masterminded the deadly hit job, she was finally tracked down in Mexico City.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

March 16, 2021 Las Vegas, Nevada-based Coin Cloud has 1,600 machines offering 35 different digital currencies up and running across the U.S., with another 400 going up this month and plans to have 10,000 installed by the end of the year. ""Our company has grown 400%, 500% every year since 2014 and is self-financed,"" Chris McAlary, Coin Cloud's founder and CEO of Coin Cloud, said. ""The industry has grown out of consumer demand, not because of some VC behind us."" Making an investment is the biggest reason people use the machines, followed by remittance or paying off an invoice, typically an international payment, McAlary said. ""You could buy bitcoin in the U.S. and have it immediately sent to family in another country,"" so long as there are places to cash it, Clegg said. The transaction fees could be lower than those of other money-transfer companies like Western Union or MoneyGram, she added. Convenience is also a factor. ""A bitcoin ATM is the only way to get bitcoin in under 20 minutes,"" said Ben Weiss, president and COO of CoinFlip, which like Coin Cloud, pitches its machines to retailers and convenience stops as a way to bring in additional foot traffic and extra income for renting out space. Also in expansion mode, Chicago-based CoinFlip operates 2,000 bitcoin ATMs in 46 states, adding 1,000 of the ATMs in 2020 and another 500 so far this year. ""The reason people use the bitcoin ATMs is there are still a lot of people who are unbanked, or underbanked,"" added Weiss. About 7.1 million U.S. households, or 5.4%, did not have a bank account in 2019, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That cash economy has many making weekly treks to cash paychecks. ""In smaller town USA, check cashiers are still a real thing,"" said Clegg. Consumers should consider the transaction fees and locations of bitcoin ATMs, with some operators more scrupulous than others, said Clegg, who also cautioned those using the machines to buy digital currency to first check what it's fetching online.

Crypto-trader defrauded of Rs 10 lakh worth of Bitcoin: Report By Published 4 hours ago A Bengaluru-based crypto-currency trader was defrauded of Rs 10 lakh worth of Bitcoin, after an individual approached the trader offering to handle his account and provide high returns, MoneyControl reported The trader has reported the incident to the Central CEN Police, the report said. The incident dates back to February 22, when the trader opened an account with CoinSwitch Kuber, a crypto-trading platform. When the trader tried to loan funds into the trading account an issue occurred, which prompted them to lodge a complaint on a Telegram group related to crypto-currency trading. The fraudster used this opportunity to contact the trader. They told the trader that they would handle the account and offer high returns. The complainant then shared their login credentials for CoinSwitch Kuber, including the One Time Password (OTP). Using this information, the fraudster then transferred Rs 10 lakh worth of Bitcoins to their personal account. The complainant said that many users on the platform faced similar issues, the report said. CoinSwitch was founded in 2017 as a crypto-currency wallet and aggregator of crypto-exchanges across the world. In June 2020, it launched its trading platform Kuber. In a statement to MediaNama, the company said that cooperating with the investigating authorities and that it has advised all its users to be extremely careful in handling their OTPs and account details.

In case of any doubts or queries, users should first email us on csksupport@coinswitch.co. These details are also available under the Help & Support section on the CoinSwitch Kuber app, the company said. The trader, however, has limited legal recourse. In the case of payment frauds, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) created a limited liabilityframework that gives customers the power to recover their funds in case of a fraud. But since crypto-currency trading is not regulated, the police have had to file a case under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and certain sections of the Indian Penal Code.

62,The rise of Bitcoin in Singapore,itweb,"Mar 19, 2021",2021-03-19 06:40:00,"Until recently, Bitcoins were held outside the frame of government regulations, but in 2017, the Central Bank of Singapore expressed its interest in crypto-currency. Read time 3min 40sec Taking a step back to the previous years in terms of crypto-currencies, we can see there is a recent significant increasing factor that is responsible for the popularity of the notion of crypto-currency itself. As you know, there is a type of crypto-currency that has captured the attention not just of investors, but also of the general public. We are talking about Bitcoin, and to narrow things down, we are going to look at the rise of Bitcoin in Singapore. Before we dive into more detail about this segment of crypto-currency, we have to take a moment to admire Singapore's amazing progress. Since declaring independence, life in Singapore was rather simple and it had a slow start. But, this is not the case for the present situation of Singapore; on the contrary, now it is considered a technology leader and is recognised as one of the most developed countries in the world. And this is only the current situation; we do not even know, nor can we predict, what the future holds for Singapore. But first, lets look at the major influences of the development of Singapore. When it all started It is all part of the crypto-currency, which indicates trading and digital money transfer that is allowed by cryptography. Knowing this, there are several crypto-currencies, and Bitcoin is probably the most popular one. Until recently, Bitcoins were held outside the frame of government regulations, but in 2017, the Central Bank of Singapore expressed its interest in the notion of crypto-currency. Many have no idea what this represents, but you can visit https://bitcoinequaliser.org/and you will find all of the details you need that will help you get a better understanding of this relatively new way of functioning. This means that from 2018, Singapore was making the most important decision of including Bitcoin and the other forms of crypto-currencies into its payment system. This is the turning point for the rise of Bitcoin regarding the territories of Singapore. The rise of popularity Initially, there were just a few people who showed interest in finding out more about this subject. Some of them lost interest due to the lack of information and understanding of the subject of crypto-currencies; to be more precise, of Bitcoins. And for those who believed in it and invested in this type of digital currency, well, we all know what happened next. The fast-moving speed that allowed the value of Bitcoins to increase is the number one factor of their popularity. To put this in numbers, the initial estimated value of a Bitcoin was around $0.05, but it all escalated rather quickly and in just several years, the value went up to $9 000. Seeing this amazing progress, people were starting to express their interest, thus the increased popularity of this popular crypto-currency called Bitcoin. Where to buy it? There are several ways you can buy Bitcoins. The most popular one is by using a Bitcoin Web site, then there are third-party brokers and Bitcoin ATMs. As we have established, Bitcoins are completely digital currency and that is why most people choose to buy them online through a Bitcoin Web site. Understanding this, Singapore has become the second country in the world that has incorporated regulations for Bitcoins The sites that offer you Bitcoins must follow certain rules and restrictions. If you are looking for a beginner-friendly Bitcoin Web site that is rather popular in Singapore, then you should visit Coinhako.com. The site is straightforward and you will not have any trouble dealing with your Bitcoins. Another popular site for buying Bitcoins is Coinbase.com. Then there is Binance.us, a popular site that offers a multi-language option so that you can have a positive experience while making your purchase. Or you can try Luno.com, which is another Web site that will provide you the necessary information so that you can easily complete your purchase.

Squawk Box SkyBridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci told CNBC on Thursday he believes bitcoincan continue to move higher over the long-term and eventually with fewer wild swings, as adoption picks up. He likened his outlook for the historically volatile cryptocurrency to shares of Amazon Scaramucci made the comparison in response to a question from ""Squawk Box"" co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin, who asked the hedge fund founder what will happen to the price of bitcoin if, eventually, early investors decide they can no longer generate outsized returns, prompting them to sell and buy another fledging asset they see as poised for big gains. ""Bitcoin is 12 years old. But if you bought Amazon after the 12th year, you got a 64x return on your money from 2009 to 2021,"" Scaramucci said, explaining that Amazon's massive gains in its first 12 years  gaining over 3,600% from its May 1997 IPO to May 2009  did not preclude the stock from soaring higher in its next dozen years. ""Amazon now, 20 years later, is trading with more stability. It got a very big pop because of the pandemic, but just take a look at its long-term chart, and I think that will happen to bitcoin,"" he said. ""Once it fully scales ... you're going to be looking at that situation and saying, 'OK, it's way less speculative.'"" Bitcoin, which was created in 2009, has experienced a meteoric rise since inception and in recent months. It traded around $58,000 per coin Thursday morning. But just six months ago, it was priced at roughly $11,000. This year alone, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap has nearly doubled, according to Coindesk data Total supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million. Roughly 18.66 million coins are in circulation now, Coindesk data shows. Proponents see bitcoin's predetermined supply limit as one reason why its price can continue to rise as more investors seek ownership. Bitcoin has been prone to wild price swings in its history. In 2017, it mounted a big rally and traded at nearly $20,000 per coin in December of that year, its record high at the time. But then in 2018, in what's become known as bitcoin lost about 80% of its value. Some bitcoin bulls see the current run as different due to increased institutional adoption.

68,"Bitcoin's Not Really an Inflation Hedge, Bank of America Says",barrons,"Mar 17, 2021",2021-03-17 15:04:00,"Ownership concentration and environmental impacts are also of concern, wrote analyst Francisco Blanch. Bitcoins Not Really an Inflation Hedge, Bank of America Says By March 17, 2021 11:04 am ET Order Reprints Text size Dreamstime If youre looking for a hedge against inflation, Bitcoin probably wont work. And if youre worried about climate change, its a problematic asset as well. Those are two conclusions from a new Bank of America report that takes a negative outlook on the digital currency. The report by Francisco Blanch analyzes Bitcoin based on various criteria, including reviewing the key argument for many recent Bitcoin bulls that it can hedge a portfolio against inflation risks. Supply is capped at 21 million Bitcoin, so presumably the cryptocurrency is protected from the kind of money printing that devalues traditional currencies. Blanch, however, says that evidence from the past several years seems to disprove that argument. Broadly, we find that Bitcoin has not been particularly compelling as an inflation hedge as commodities and even equities provide better correlations to inflation, he wrote. As such, we think the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, declining volatility, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends exclusively on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply on a forward basis. Some of this is still hard to gauge, because major developed nations  particularly the U.S.have seen relatively little inflation over the past decade. So Bitcoin has not been fully tested in a truly inflationary environment. Blanch also looked at other aspects of the cryptocurrency that may make it unsuitable for many investors portfolios. He says that 95% of Bitcoin is owned by just 2.4% of accounts, a level of concentration that makes this instrument impractical as a payments mechanism or even as an investment vehicle. And the big accounts have continued buying amid the latest run-up, according to Blanch. Bitcoin recently hit all-time highs above $60,000. The high ownership concentration leaves the asset vulnerable to sharp price swings on account of movements in these whale accounts, he wrote. Indeed looking at the income distribution, we find that Bitcoin inequality is unprecedented and easily eclipses countries plagued with the most income inequality. Blanch also looked at the societal impact of Bitcoin. A growing environmental, social and governance movement (ESG) has tried to quantify how various companies and assets affect society. The social benefits may be mixed  Bitcoin has been used for nefarious activities, but can also be used by people living under repressive regimes to store their money. Blanch thinks the social negatives outweigh the positives. Bitcoins environmental impact has increasingly come under scrutiny, because the miners that produce Bitcoins use considerable electricity to run their computers. In fact, the network is now using as much electricity in a year as Greece, he noted. And he estimates that every additional $1 billion put into Bitcoin causes as much carbon dioxide as 1.2 million cars  produce in a year. Others have come to mixed conclusions on Bitcoins environmental impact. The University of Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance has estimatedthat Bitcoin consumes 0.6% of the worlds electricity, using about as much as Sweden and Ukraine. While that raises concerns about its environmental sustainability, there is currently little evidence suggesting that Bitcoin directly contributes to climate change, the center wrote. Companies including (ticker: SQ) are working on reducing Bitcoins environmental impact, though some Bitcoin proponents argue that the networks inefficiencies are a key feature keeping it from being hacked.

In the United States, President Joe Bidens administration has expressed concerns about Bitcoins role in money laundering, the potential fallout from financial speculation, and Bitcoins environmental impact. In China, where more than half of new Bitcoins are mined, the massive amounts of energy needed to do so are at odds with Beijings climate goals, leading to a crackdown from authorities. Unlike fiat currencies (such as the US dollar, euro, or yen), Bitcoin is not controlled by a government or central bank and does not require an intermediary to verify transactions.  It is, by design, decentralized. Instead of a bank, transactions made with Bitcoins are verified by a global, decentralized network of computers (aka mining platforms) that rush to verify blocks of transactions to be added to Bitcoins blockchain  a ledger public.  The winner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. Mining rigs are made up of very powerful computers, sometimes in the thousands, that work in unison to solve complex mathematical problems.  It takes a lot of energy. Supporters of Bitcoin claim it is subject to an unfair standard, arguing that the vast financial systems that underpin fiat currencies consume far more resources than cryptocurrencies. But that hasnt stopped some governments from taking action to limit Bitcoins carbon footprint. A coal-fired power plant can be seen behind a factory in Baotou city, Chinas Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

China accounts for around 65% of global Bitcoin mining, according toat the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance. The Inner Mongolia region  with its cheap energy  accounts for just over 8% of Bitcoins production.  By comparison, the United States as a whole only produces and processes around 7% of the worlds Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the regional government of Inner Mongolia announced plans to halt all further mining of cryptocurrency and shut down existing operations in a bid to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants. The huge autonomous zone adjacent to the Mongolian nation failed to meet central government emissions targets in 2019, prompting the regions development commission to put the kibosh on crypto-mining by the next. end of April 2021. This decision would have led the miners to relocate their farms elsewhere in China, where climate-friendly hydropower often dominates. Meanwhile, Chinese Bitcoin miners were looking to reduce electricity costs and regulatory burdens, moving even further to countries like Russia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and Iran  which are the biggest countries.

Capital flight is an activity that officials are trying to control.  China has strict capital controls, but the unregulated flight of capital out of China via digital assets reached $ 17.5 billion last year, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield. Last August, research from Chainalysis suggested that around $ 50 billion in crypto assets had left China in the previous year, of which $ 18 billion was the relatively stable Tether cryptocurrency.

The FATF helps address the growing risks posed by virtual assets, which can include regulatory, climate and reputational threats. Nearly 36% of Bitcoin Mining Worldwide is in Chinas Xinjiang Region, Says Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance [File: Murad Sezer/Reuters] Other ESG concerns Almost 36% of Bitcoin mining globally takes place in Chinas Xinjiang region, according to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance. Xinjiang is where the United Nations and other rights groups say more than a million minority Uyghur Muslims have been held in internment camps.  The United States and other governments have called Chinas treatment of Uyghurs genocide  an accusation Beijing denies, saying the internment camps are vocational training centers to combat extremism. Tim Swanson, head of market intelligence for Clearmatics, a company that designs protocols for decentralized finance, points out another negative: the amount of carbon produced by crypto mining operations in China compared to the amount of economic growth they generate. Coin miners have essentially added the value of a provinces electricity consumption without adding the value of a provinces economic output, so Bitcoin mining is actually a net drag on the economy as a whole, Swanson told Al Jazeera.  And the profits from mining are probably only going to a few thousand people, such as mining manufacturers, mining farm operators and their stakeholders. Swanson sees no benefit for China or other countries to encourage any kind of proof-of-work mining  the form of digital currency creation that provides the security of the blockchain network but requires huge energy inputs for the community. distributed based on consensus.

In an interview with MediaNama, Pagidipati said that the time for an outright ban on crypto-currencies is over, and that the government should work with the industry to address specific regulatory concerns and encourage innovation. The government announced that it would introduce The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 , which will ban private crypto-currencies while at the same time providing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with the requisite legal powers to develop a central bank-backed digital currency (CBDC), according to an official Lok Sabha Bulletin Part IIfor the Budget Session 2021 of Parliament.

If they want to help create a decentralised Rupee, were all ears. Wed love to throw our technical know-how into it and weve been telling regulators that, he said. In the long run, 10 years in the future, people around the world will have the right to own dollars, rupees, Bitcoin, or whatever. A US citizen might have 20% of his money in dollars, 20% in Bitcoin, like 10% in rupee and 10% into other stuff. Theres going to be four or five large currenciesin the world, the dollar, or maybe on other one, maybe the rupee will to get there too. But then if youre not in the top four or five currencies, everyone else is going to be using Bitcoin. I believe the large countries will start transacting in Bitcoins.  Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay Bitcoin could also be used for interbank payments, when in the future there will be 10-15 large global neo-banks out there, Pagidipati added. People still feel the pain of 2008 Whether it was the mortgage crisis that brought the global investment banks to its knees in 2007-08 or the LIBOR scandal in 2012, faith in the financial system broke, said Pagidipati. I know some people inside the banking world and the impression I get is that they are still shaken by it. When you break faith with the essential trust that you need between the institutions, you need a replacement. Its not something you can just fix incrementally by saying, okay, well do some reforms, he said. Look at who is now coming of age, who is the largest demographic on ZebPay, the are group that is most interested in crypto. Its the kids who grew up watching the effect of the 2008 financial crisis on their parents. Things used to be so fun and free and then suddenly, something happened in their childhood. This is almost a cultural phenomenon, its shaping a generation. So they will never think of money the way that older generations do.  Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay ZebPay could have been a billion dollar company Pagidipati and Rangala said that at the time of the Reserve Bank of Indias April 2018 circular, ZebPay had a 70% market share with millions of users. We were well on the way towards becoming a billion dollar company. By now, we would have probably been closer to that or to a valuation similar to Paytm, said Rangala. Coinbase recently announced that theyre doing an IPO. Theres no reason why an Indian company couldnt be in a similar position with this gigantic user base and potential market. I think it (RBI circular) was a setback, but if that setback and now means that were looking at clarity, then all the better. With the latest remarks from the finance minister I think everybody feels encouraged because, she said specifically that were not going to go all in one direction  Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay The duo said that Indias crypto-firms and blockchain companies could easily scale their services, if encouraged, eventually becoming unicorns in their own right. We should talk about working together all the stakeholders, Rangala added. Would love to see a National Token Commission According to Pagidipati whenever new technologies or innovations come out, governments become worried in terms of their sovereign rights, monetary policy or fiscal policy or even capital controls. He said that ZebPay is in process of getting a license in Singapore, under the Monetary Authority of Singapores regulations for digital currencies. The great thing about these things is that as money evolves and regulations come about, political structures also evolve. I would love for the government to create a Crypto-Token commission made up of politicians, academics and, entrepreneurs. The commission would issue warnings to investors looking to buy a token. The commission could also look into rating tokens based on their risk.  Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay Under the regulations in Singapore, crypto-firms are instructed on whats allowed, whats not allowed, custodial services of funds, resolution processes, g financial statements, doing security audits, among other requirements, Pagidipati explained. It requires companies to be legitimate and to not be fly by night operators. Its a very important responsibility to hold onto to peoples financial assets, he said. Advertisement.

Given that the United States and India are two large democracies and both promote technology innovation, India can copy frameworks adopted in the United States for regulating crypto-currencies, Pagidipati said. If the token is considered a security, then you need an exchange license similar to a brokers license, he said. Industry should understand governments concerns Both Pagidipati and Rangala said that rather than give the Finance Minister a list of policy recommendations and suggestions, they would rather listen to the government and regulators on how best to safeguarded certain risks and concerns they may have. Pagidipati said that they want to listen to the governments concerns about crypto-currencies and how the industry can solve",https://www.medianama.com/2021/03/223-zebpay-bitcoin-cryptos-interview/

72,Bulls favored ahead of record $6.1B Bitcoin options expiry on March 26,menafn,"Mar 17, 2021",2021-03-17 04:31:39,"class=content id=press_release_tab_2>Over the past two months, the open interest on Bitcoin options increased by 60% to reach $13.5 billion as the BTC price rose to a new all-time high. The result of Bitcoin's price appreciation and the rising options open int Tweet on Twitter (MENAFN - FxPro) class=content id=press_release_tab_2> Over the past two months, the open interest on Bitcoin options increased by 60% to reach $13.5 billion as the BTC price rose to a new all-time high. The result of Bitcoin's price appreciation and the rising options open interest resulted in a potentially historic $6.1 billion expiry set for March 26. Most exchanges offer monthly exposures, although a few also hold weekly options for short-term contracts. Jan. 29, 2020, had the largest expiry on record as $3.5 billion worth of option contracts expired. This figure represented 36% of all open interest at that time. The above data shows that Bitcoin's March 26 expiry holds 100,400 BTC. That unusual concentration translates to 45% of its contracts set to expire in eleven days. It is worth noting that not every option will trade at expiry as some of those strikes now sound unreasonable, especially considering there are less than two weeks left. Unlike futures contracts, options are divided into two segments. Call (buy) options allow the buyer to acquire BTC at a fixed price on the expiry date. Generally speaking, those are used on either neutral arbitrage trades or bullish strategies. Meanwhile, the put (sell) options are commonly used as hedge or protection from negative price swings. By excluding the neutral-to-bearish put options below $47,000 and the call options above $66,000, it is easier to estimate the potential impact of Friday's expiry. Incentives to pump or dump the price by more than 17% become less likely, as the potential gains will seldom surpass the cost. This data leaves $1.13 billion worth of call options from $32,000 to $64,000 strikes for the aggregate options expiry on March 26. Meanwhile, the more bearish put options down to $47,000 amount to $462 million. Therefore, there's a $668 million imbalance favoring the more bullish call options. While a $6.1 billion options expiry could be worrisome, nearly 43% of them are already deemed worthless. As for the remaining open interest, bulls are mainly in control because the recent price hike to a new all-time high obliterated 84% of the bearish options. As expiry gets closer, a growing number of put options will lose their value if BTC remains above $52,000, increasing the advantage from the neutral-to-bullish call options.

Artists and musicians such as Beeple, Grimes and Kings of Leo 16 Mar 2021, 12:47 BITCOINS have helped create a new world of digital currencies and now attention is turning to a new trend, non-fungible tokens or NFTS. Artists and musicians such as Beeple, Grimes and Kings of Leon are turning to the tokens to sell their work, but what is an NFT? 1 NFTs are unique digital tokens that use the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies Credit: Reuters Interest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Ripple has soared this year. The value of Bitcoinhas been boosted and hit record highs this year after backing from Tesla founder Elon Musk while Reddit groups have encouraged amateur investors to buy Dogecoin and Ripple cryptocurrencies. Investing in cryptocurrencies is highly speculative and financial regulators have warned that you should be prepared to lose all your money. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are digital coins that  are stored and can be used to make payments through online technology called the blockchain. Each coin has its own unique code that is stored securely on the blockchain and the same technology has been used in the development of NFTs. What is an NFT? Cryptocurrencies are really collections of computer code but coins such as Bitcoin or Dogecoin have recognisable logos. An NFT provides something different as it digitises a piece of work such as art or music and turns it into a non-fungible token that is stored on the blockchain. That means it cannot be replicated and is unique to whoever owns it. Crypto commentator Jonathan Marriott said NFTs provide a legitimate way of verifying ownership and tracking the origins of an item. He said:  ""An NFT lets you record where and when something is made and track the whole process to verify that it is legitimate. ""The public blockchain element makes it irrefutbale. No-one can fake it."" He said medical and food manufacturers could use it so consumers can follow the supply chain so they know where their products are coming from. Alternatively, an NFT could be created alongside a new trainer so you know if your pair of pricey  sneakers are genuine. Why are NFTs popular? NFTs have become a desirable collectable as influencers, artists and celebrities use them to promote products. It gives collectors a chance to own a unique digitised item such as art, music and even trading cards. There is already a dedicated NFT trading card series called Blockchain Heroes. NFT ownership history and transactions are stored on the blockchain which provides a form of authenticity and helps avoid fakes. Digital artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, sold an NFT at auction with Christie's this week for a record $69.3 million. The work, called Everydays: The first 5,000 days, was a digital collage he had worked on each day since 2007. A new piece of digital artwork was created and added by Beeple everyday for 5,000 days from May 1 2007. Musician Grimes has also raised $6 million by selling several pieces of digital artwork at auction through NFT marketplace Nifty. Kings of Leon has released its latest album as an NFT, which includes exclusive artwork and gig tickets. It has raised $1.45 million so far according to crypto website Cointelegraph. Some of the funds raised will go towards the Crew Nation Fund, which supports live music crews affected by the pandemic. Mr Marriott said: ""If you can create a collection of NFTs and build a brand, there is no reason why they couldn't become more popular. ""People like the sense of community around it. ""Like any collectable, ultimately the value is decided by the sellers and what the buyers will pay for it."" How risky are NFTs? Buying an NFT, like any collectable, is a risky bet on the value going up. If there is no demand for the NFT you buy then you could end up paying a large amount for something that declines in value or that you cannot sell. NFTs are still a new market so there is unlikely to be the same demand you will find for other physical items such as trading cards, art or classic cars. You could also create your own NFT but there is no guarantee of a buyer and you could end up wasting your time and money.

Cryptocurrency What is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, why is it buzzing and other key questions answered Everything that you need to know about the fund that holds more Bitcoins than any other financial institution in the world. Ashish Rukhaiyar / 04:36 PM IST Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, is the worlds largest digital asset management firm. If you are interested in Bitcoin, chances are that you might have heard about an entity named Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. If you are wondering what the fuss is about, here is a primer to help you play catch up. What is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust? To start with, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, is the worlds largest digital asset management firm and also the first of its kind to be registered with the US regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a reporting company. What this means is that the company reports its financials to the SEC, which is a plus as it increases transparency. The firm is said to hold nearly 6.5 lakh Bitcoinsa little over 3 percent of the total Bitcoins in circulationthat, as per current prices, are worth $36.6 billion. Currently, each Bitcoin has a value of nearly $56,400. Interestingly, the company is said to be the second-largest holder of Bitcoin after Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin who is believed to own 1 million Bitcoins. How can one invest in Bitcoins through GBTC? GBTC, which was launched in 2013 as Bitcoin Investment Trust, offers accredited investorsdefined by SEC on the basis of certain income and net worth criteriaan opportunity to invest in the cryptocurrency. The minimum investment size is pegged at $50,000 while some of the other funds of the firm have a minimum investment size of $25,000. The funds also charge annual fees ranging between 2 percent and 3 percent. Accredited investors can buy or sell their shares through private placement.Retail investors got an opportunity to own a slice of the fund in January 2020 when it became an SEC reporting company that allowed accredited investors to sell their shares in the secondary market after an initial lock-in period. Currently, GBTC shares are trading at around $52 apiece. Close Related stories Indias first legal offline sex toy shop opens doors How has been the demand for GBTC shares? Short answer: huge. The demand for GBTC has been soarsing so much that in the current calendar year, the shares of the company have gained over 60 percent while the S&P 500 benchmark index is up less than 4 percent. The fund saw its assets grow from $2 billion to over $20 billion in 2020 as demands from entities like pension funds, endowments and hedge funds registered a huge spike. As per the funds regulatory filings, average commitment of institutional investors rose to $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $2.9 million in the prior quarter. What are the risks involved in investing in GBTC? To start with, a large section of market participants has often said that the share price of GBTC does not reflect the price of the underlying Bitcoin assets and that the fund charges a huge premium along with the high annual fees. There have been instances when the shares were trading at a premium, which was double the value of the underlying Bitcoin assets of the fund. GBTC attributes such premium to supply and demand forces. In the recent past, the premiums have move in a range of 5 percent to as much as 40 percent as Bitcoin prices continued to touch record highs while generating higher demand.In 2017, well-known investor Andrew Left of Citron Research publicly urged the SEC to look into GBTC while saying that the fund is a far more dangerous instrument being marketed to mom & pop. It further added that GBTC will lose its advantage when more options, including the more transparent and regulated exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are available for Bitcoins.To be fair though, much has changed since then including the fact that GBTC has become a SEC reporting entity. Many market participants attribute the share premiums to the hassle-free process that the fund offers to own Bitcoins. Since its shares are publicly traded, an individual can buy or sell through any broking platform. Does GBTC offer investment options in other cryptocurrencies as well? In early 2018, GBTC launched a fund called Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund through which investors can gain exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies. Apart from Bitcoin, the Digital Large Cap Fund also has an exposure in Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin. Currently, the fund has assets under management worth nearly $493 million. The popularity of the fund can be gauged from the fact that its shares have gained nearly 87 percent in the current calendar year while the last 12 months return has been a whopping 438 percent. GBTC also has single-asset funds focussed on Horizen, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Zcash and Stellar Lumens. Can Indians invest in GBTC shares? While there are a few trading platforms in India that offer overseas trading facilities to Indian investors, GBTC shares are not part of the offering since the shares are traded in the OTCover the countermarket and not on an exchange like NYSE or Nasdaq. Current regulations bar such platforms from offering trading in shares of firms listed on OTC markets.

The RubiX (RBX) proofchain was purpose-built on Proprietary 'Proof of Harvest' (POH) Conse Tweet on Twitter (MENAFN - GlobeNewsWire - Nasdaq)  LEWES, Del., March 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RubiX , a full-scale Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and security solutions company, today announces the launch of its free, open-source public blockchain testnet availability with the Blockchain Green Initiative. The RubiX (RBX) proofchain was purpose-built on Proprietary 'Proof of Harvest' (POH) Consensus mechanism to facilitate cloud-to-chain migrations that meet the need for a variety of enterprise-level applications, including NFTs, DeFi, Payments, Smart Contracts and Industrial Applications. RubiX provides an unparalleled level of security as a layer-one solution, combined with a decentralized identity token (DID) which is split non-linearly into private and public shares. The result is a level of security 1,000,000 times stronger than Bitcoin's ECDSA 256 encryption algorithm. 'Our goal was to cut down the Carbon Emissions caused by Bitcoin and other Proof of work (PoW) based blockchain mining activities, using a secure proof-of-harvest alternative that's cryptographically superior to the current blockchain platforms,' says Chakradhar Kommera, Chief Technology Officer at RubiX. 'Our solution can be used to democratize an unlimited number of industries and is driven by users, not investors. 100% of RubiX tokens are meant for eco-friendly mining without any carbon emissions. Smart contracts  &  NFTs consume more energy than simple coin transfers with current PoW protocols, hence there is an even bigger need to use a sustainable blockchain technology.' Not only is POH consensus from RubiX faster (0.25 seconds confirmation) and more secure than competitors, it uses no dedicated power for mining, and it is 100% eco-friendly. As the use of cryptocurrency increases, so does the industry's carbon footprint. RubiX uses minimal nodes for POH based consensus, so its carbon footprint is zero. RubiX is committed to nullifying its environmental impact by refraining from POW mining. Anyone with a computer or a smartphone can download the full RubiX node and become a validator and a miner using no extra electricity for the same, contributing to the goal of a carbon-neutral economy. RubiX is currently handling more than three million unique weekly active Industrial users - more than any other public blockchain at this point of time.

The platform leverages real world Distributed File System (DFS) based on content-based addressing for data storage. RubiX has primarily two types of tokens: Protocol tokens generated with strong mathematical proofs that are mined by nodes working to secure the network by storing proofs (capped under 51 million), and Asset tokens that can represent any underlying asset or contract including NFTs. DeFi or Smart Contracts, RubiX Network is an aggregation of several account-chains existing in parallel. Transactions achieve consensus individually, allowing for asynchronous parallelism leading to very high scalability. Account-chains are linked through unique tokens  &  tokenchain hashes.

The use of the tool, however, is spreading to sectors that are not necessarily linked to cryptocurrencies. With the arrival of the pandemic in Brazil, for example, blockchain is gaining more and more utility when being used for document authentication without having to leave home. One tool that is taking advantage of technology is e-Notoriado. In December last year, the digital authentication function was adopted by the platform and, in four months, about 156 thousand pages of documents have already been authenticated by the blockchain system. Thus, users can share the documents via WhatsApp, email, SMS or any other messaging application, which will continue to have the same legal value as the original file. But what is blockchain? The blockchain concept was born in 2008, with the creation of Bitcoin. The technology was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto, pseudonym of the supposed creator of the cryptocurrency, to prevent data from being altered, copied or exchanged in the virtual environment. As a result, transactions are safer, preventing a person from spending 1 BTC twice or saying that they sent 10 BTC and transferring a smaller amount, for example. To this day, the currencys cryptography is intact, with no successful attempt at fraud. In summary, the technology uses pieces of code generated online, connects the information in blocks, forming a chain. The trick here is that each block has information from the previous one, that is, if someone wants to invade the chain, they will need to unveil the code of all previous blocks. Blockchain Company Ripple's Value Reaches $ 10 Billion Blockchain on Authentications The authentication process, according to the President of Colgio Notarial do Brasil, Giselle Oliveira, is carried out through Notarchain, a private blockchain network of notaries. The process takes place in the same way: the requested document has a unique code that will be deposited in a block with all the transactions in that network. From there, a chain is built, in which each block is linked to the previous one, making it impossible to change the information that has already been stored. The document registered by user A in Minas Gerais can be verified by a notary at the request of user B in Tocantins. This user B, with the certified copy in PDF, can also request the printed document of the original document that it came from Minas Gerais, by user A, guaranteeing faithful reproduction and its legal effects , explains Oliveira. She explains that the process is fast, as well as the face-to-face procedure, but recommends that the service be scheduled in advance.

Smart contracts came along, and that created defi and NFTs. Thats what changed the game. Thats what got me excited. Thats why its a lot like the internet, Cuban detailed.

And even bigger companies like Microsoft start accepting it. Bitcoin supporters also see it as an inflation safeguard. Since both the left and right of the Federal Reserve print currency, some are concerned about the future of the dollar. Perhaps you think, can we hop into the bitcoin car, or drive the other way round? We want to take four risks into consideration before we dive: Is it one of the most volatile investments? Bitcoin has unbelievable peaks and worth plummets. A year after, bitcoin was only worth eight cents back in July 2010, a year since it was released to the planet. The worth leapt in the position until any waves really began to occur in 2017. Another Bitcoin hit $1,000 early in October, then reached $5,000 and then doubled in November to $10,000. By the middle of December, nearly 20,000 dollars was worth one bitcoin. Finally the bubble broke and by November 2018 the value fell to some $3,500. But the value of Bitcoin began again to rise in 2020. Will this increase in valuation continue? We do not know why. We do not know. The fact is, however, that variance often corresponds to risk. And risk is not bad, so you have to know how much it will really cost. Identity crisis? One of the crucial problems with Bitcoins is that it can be controlled with disclosing your identity. You may think that this a fantastic idea and people wouldnt know how much coin you have or whom you are transacting. However, this is something very dangerous, according to the experts. If the identity of the person is not disclosed ever, it is not possible to take any legal action against the person in case of forgery or something like that. The person can stay behind the curtain. This is a real deal if you think closely. Bitcoin is not approved in many countries now and this is one of the reasons why it is not authorized. No control of central bank or nation Since its release in 2009, Bitcoin has been wrapped in secrecy. It runs through every bank or nation-state without supervision, which means that it is traded for peer. Its like the Wild West with currencies  the constitution cant be upheld. This is an enticing attribute for some people. Others acknowledge the possibility of nullification. Bitcoin is widely used for illegal activity Since the cryptocurrency scene is done anonymously in any bitcoin company, cybercrimes are on hot spots. All kinds of dubious activities take place using Bitcoin  including blackmail, phishing, Ponzi schemes, and dealings on the dark web. There are, of course, many up-to-date users who still use cryptocurrencies. However, hackers who know a lot better than Joes average about codifying and applications will use that expertise to their benefit. If you are set to get this undertaking started, relax your nerves as it is not a 100 meter running marathon. Many people like to sell coins, products or services like this, so you should work with them with care. Theyve been in a coin before you most frequently and want to add value to this coin. Many players on Facebook, Twitter and other social networking platforms are affected. In the field of cryptocurrencies there are a ton of dubious people, but use the better assessment of who you believe. You will reach Cryptos safe world if you study the market and invest with caution. There is a serious lack of transparency among the players in this market. If you can take the right direction, it is highly lucrative. Do look before you dive and get from very little to zero as far as possible.

The... The Florida Panthers were on their way to another one of those victories Joel Quenneville would classify among the most rewarding in a season when another frustrating break came their way. 3h ago UK 'puts lives at risk' by cutting aid to Syria by third The UK cut humanitarian funding to Syria by nearly a third at a major United Nations donor conference on Tuesday, a reduction which aid agencies working in the conflict-wracked country said will put lives at risk. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab promised at least 205 million in aid during an international conference on supporting Syria hosted by Brussels. Last year the UK pledged 300m and in 2019 it gave 400m. After 10 years of war, Syrias humanitarian needs have never been greater, according to the United Nations, which is seeking a record $10 billion this year to help 12.3 million people in Syria and another 5.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt. Germany led pledges at the two-day video conference by promising a record 1.74 billion euros, while the United States pledged $600 million and France promised 560 million euros. Qatar said it would contribute $100 million. ""The Syrian tragedy must not last another 10 years. Ending it begins by restoring hope. It begins with our commitments - here, today,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. Addressing the conference, Mr Raab said that the UK had given 3.5bn to help Syrians since 2012. The UKs reduction was not as great as some aid organisations had feared but came despite direct pleas from the United Nations not to cut assistance to Syria. A decision to turn away from Syria today will come back to bite us all tomorrow, the United Nations aid chief Mark Lowcock told the Guardian last week. In 2014 our appeal was poorly funded. In 2015 there was a huge exodus of people from Syria to Europe. On Monday, Mr Mark Lowcock told the Security council that the consequences of reduced aid could be dramatic and widespread. The need for aid has increased amid the coronavirus pandemic and the collapsing value of the Syrian pound, the UN said. Conditions are deteriorating for Syrians, according to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. ""More than 13 million people need humanitarian assistance to survive this year,"" he said. ""That's over 20 percent more than last year, and the majority of the population is now facing hunger."" The decision to slash the aid budget to Syria by a third will put lives at risk, according to a joint statement by nine major NGOs working in Syria, including the International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Action Against Hunger UK, Care International UK, Islamic Relief UK, Christian Aid, Syria Relief and CAFOD. This decision risks the lives of 210,000 Syrians who rely on UK aid for food every month, as well as the 100,000 Syrian refugees in the region who depend on UK aid for clean water and sanitation, the statement said. Already over 90 percent of Syrians are living in poverty, 12.4 million are suffering from food insecurity, and 12.2 million lack regular access to clean water. Responding to the UK reduction in funding, some aid agencies complained that they were unable to plan programming without concrete forewarning of the aid cuts, which come a month before the start of the new financial year. Taxpayers have a right to know where their money is going and currently these decisions are subject to little or no scrutiny, said Jean-Michel Grand, executive director of Action Against Hunger UK. In November, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a 5bn cut to aid  from 0.7 per cent of gross national income to 0.5 per cent  saying that at a time of ""unprecedented crisis the government must make tough choices"". This cut is yet another reminder of the catastrophic consequences of the Governments decision to break its promise to maintain the aid budget at 0.7 percent of national income and they must urgently rethink this approach, said Kevin Watkins, CEO of Save the Children UK. 13h ago INSIDER A new lawsuit says Epstein told a woman he sex-trafficked he'd feed her to alligators and have her son deported if she spoke to authorities. 6h ago Business Insider Carlson struggled to make sense of the interview, saying, ""I don't think it clarified much"" and ""I don't quite understand it."" 2h ago",https://news.yahoo.com/latest-bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-222208597.html

98,Three Israeli brothers want to help find millions in lost bitcoins,haaretz,"Mar 30, 2021",2021-03-30 10:35:22,"The surge in bitcoin value has led many people to try to access their forgotten digital wallets. Brute Brothers want to be their crypto-locksmiths Burning Man in the Rose Garden? This millennial crypto king thinks he can win the White House I see people only wanting to open a wallet, often over the phone, and start buying bitcoins, passing over important steps such as backing up their wallets or choosing a good password that they can remember when needed. Mistakes people make at this stage can come back to haunt them later on. Or Weinberger from the Brute Brothers company, Israelis alone have lost access to no fewer than 360 bitcoins, currently valued at more than $60 million Memegnetos After a year or two, when your phone is destroyed or when you switch to a new one, you have to use your backup, or perhaps you never did back up or keep the password and Seed. No cyber-magic Whats interesting about the conversation with Weinberger is his practical approach. There are no cyber-magic promises to salvage your wallet, but a mix of technological tools and a lot of detective elbow work, in an attempt to contend with the complex intrinsic security measures of digital wallets. The objective usually is, he says, not to bypass security measures, but to work with the user and with existing measures. If a user forgets his password, this leaves an open question requiring delving deep into the psychology of passwords. There are all sorts of people, and we need to learn how this specific client builds their passwords. We construct a set of rules and we run it through our engine, usually getting millions of permutations. They run these attempts on local computers that are not connected to the internet, so as not to encounter defenses raised against what is termed brute force attempts to crack a password, since these will trigger defenses that limit the number of attempts or will slow them down. If that isnt enough, or if a user is locked out due to using up the number of allowed attempts, there is still some hope with the Seed. But if youve lost that piece of paper and you dont remember the Seed words, Weinberger says there is no point in even trying. The Seed words presented to a user opening an account are taken from a dictionary containing 2,048 words. The number of possible combinations is inconceivable. Bitcoin Trading Machine is pictured in a bodega in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., February  9, 2021. CARLO ALLEGRI/ REUTERS If the possibilities of solving a Seed containing 24 words were ears of corn, youd need to build a wall around the U.S. and fill it with corn in order to contain them all, explains Weinberger. But it wouldnt be a wall like the one Trump wanted to build on the Mexican border. This one would be 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) high. Since the cryptographic task is so daunting, there is no limit on the number of attempts, so there is no risk of the wallet being locked forever, in contrast to what can happen with attempts to recover simple passwords. If, for example, youve only lost 3 or 4 words, something can be done. In (very) rare cases its possible to contend with the loss of 5 words. Six or more? Forget it. The problem could be one of memory, of course, but coffee stains, a crinkled page or illegible writing could also be a problem in reconstituting a Seed. This may also require extensive detective work. Sometimes, there is simply nothing to work with. One of our clients is a guy who last used his wallet around 2014. He purchased 1.7 bitcoins, kept the money in his digital wallet and forgot about it, says Weinberger. And then, with the surging prices in recent months, he remembered he had a treasure chest that only needed a key. He did remember his password, but the company that had developed the wallets software had folded. If the wallet worked only on his computer or cellphone this would not have been a problem, but in order to open his treasure chest he needed to communicate with the companys servers, which were no longer there. Its a bit like getting a treasure from a pirate ship that sank centuries ago. They had to dive into the companys software, which fortunately was in open-source code. After strenuous efforts they managed to connect to one of the softwares functions and extricate the lost treasure, now worth more than $88,000.",https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium-three-israeli-brothers-want-to-help-find-millions-in-lost-bitcoins-1.9666799

HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP How to choose the best (and cheapest) DIY investing platform and stocks and shares Isa The price of a bitcoin was hovering at around $58,000 last night. The rise was welcome news for people invested directly in bitcoin, but it was also a boon for people who own bitcoin-related stocks. Online Blockchain rose 6.4 per cent, or 4p, to 66.5p, while bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain  which uses algorithms to unlock new bitcoins  closed 4.6 per cent higher, or 10p, to 230p. Stock Watch - 88 Energy The value of oil and gas minnow 88 Energy soared by more than a quarter on promising results from an area it is exploring in Alaska. Data from a well it has drilled in the oil-rich North Slope region found there could be a large oil and gas deposit there. At the moment these are just indications and it will need to do more tests to confirm. Bosses said they would provide another update within 10 days.

Although the bitcoin price is up by more than 500 per cent since a stonking rally kicked off in October, it is still some way off the record highs of $61,000 it hit earlier this month. Bitcoin backers will be hoping prices will stay sky-high, Devere boss Nigel Green insists that any drops will trigger a surge of institutional investment, driving the price up permanently. According to Green, inexperienced investors are likely to cash in if bitcoin reverses, and this is when institutional investors, many of whom are just beginning to dip their toe in the crypto water, will likely dive in. They will employ the buy the dip mantra.

103,Bitcoin miners and fracking companies are working together  Quartz,qz,"Mar 29, 2021",2021-03-29 18:16:46,"One way to fix Bitcoin's carbon footprint could be to power crypto-mines with wasted flare gas. Climate reporter March 29, 2021 In 2018, the global cryptocurrency market had crashed and Sergii Gerasymovych was looking for a way to keep his Bitcoin mining company afloat. Gerasymovych eventually settled on a plan to make money while cleaning up two notoriously climate-polluting industries. Gerasymovychs biggest headacheas for all Bitcoin minerswas the price of electricity. Bitcoin miners compete against one other to unlock coins by solving increasingly difficult math problems with fleets of computers. This consumes a lot of power globally: about as much as Argentina each year Bitcoin miners profit margin largely relies on the gap between electricity bills and Bitcoins value; if the latter drops, the only way to make up the margin is to curb the former. Thats why so much of the worlds cryptocurrency mining is tied to low-cost coal and hydroelectric plantsin Asia. Gerasymovych was hunting for cheap power in the US, and stumbled on an intriguing source: Flare gas from natural gas wells. Now, a number of market trends are converging to propel a nascent industry in gas-powered Bitcoin. Fracking for Bitcoin Oil and gas wells in hydraulically fractured (fracked) shale formations produce some waste gasas a byproduct, mostly composed of methane. Since selling this gas is usually unprofitable, its typically disposed of by burning it off . Those little flares, from thousands of wells around the world, add up. Gas flaring is responsible for at least 1% of global carbon emissions, and collectively wastes hundreds of millions of dollarsworth of natural resources every year. In the US, that has made flaring a target for regulators in gas-producing states like Texas, New Mexico and North Dakota which are considering new restrictions on the practice. BlackRock, the asset manager that has stepped up pressure on companies to disclose their climate risks has called for the near eliminationof flaring globally by 2025. Anticipating a crackdown, some gas companiesare starting to look for their own solutions. One cost-effective way to reduce flaring emissions is to turn the waste gas into electricity with a generator, and use it to power something, like lights or pumps, on the well site. But Gerasymovych realized that crypto miners and gas drillers could both benefit by converting waste gas into cheap power. What better way to reduce emissions than supplying a data center, ravenous for cheap 24/7 electricity, that can be built into a transportable shipping container? There was just one problem: Perhaps because of Bitcoins tumultuous price swings, gas companies werent interested. People laughed at us, Gerasymovych said. Then three things changed. First, the pandemic struck, and the price of natural gas cratered ; an industry that was already on shaky financial footing found itself facing an existential crisisas drilling ground to a halt and scores of shale companies went bankrupt Second, thanks in part to a Feb. 2021 endorsement by Elon Musk the price of Bitcoin soared. Third, Gerasymovych decided to tweak his business model to sweeten the deal for gas companies. Rather than buy their cheap flare gas to run his own mines, his company, EZ Blockchain, charges a few hundred thousand dollars to install and perform regular maintenance on a Bitcoin mining data center, and lets the gas company reap the Bitcoins itself. In other words, the gas company becomes the miner, and uses its own gas for free. The market conditions have changed, Gerasymovych said. Now, every oil and gas company we reached out to in 2018 is calling us back because they see Bitcoin is making a lot of money. The rapidly emerging gas-to-crypto industry On Mar. 16, EZ Blockchain announcedthat it had finished setting up its latest gas-adjacent Bitcoin mine, at a gas facility near Moab, Utah operated by Wesco Operating Inc., an independent gas company with 500 wells across the US. That marks the fifth mine EZ Blockchain has set up since the pandemic started, Gerasymovych said, with at least two more on the way. Steve Degenfelder, a spokesperson for Wesco, said the companys leaders first heard about Bitcoin from some young software engineers on the staff. This was stranded gas that didnt have a market, he said. Now, weve eliminated the flaring [from that site], and greatly reduced the emissions. And it doesnt take electricity off the grid, which is getting to be the controversial issue with data centers and Bitcoin mining. EZ Blockchain and Wesco arent the only companies with the same idea. The Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom is mining Bitcoin with flare gas in Siberia Denver-based Crusoe Energy provides a similar serviceas EZ Blockchain, but usually installs the data center for free, pays the gas company for the gas, and keeps the Bitcoins itself. The company has set up 40 gas-powered mines in the US the last few years, said Cully Cavness, its president, and hopes to hit 100 by the end of 2021. Its clients includethe European multinational oil major Equinor. We have a significant backlog of projects, for months, he said. Were trying to scale quickly to meet the scale of the problem. A new incentive for gas drilling? Some digital currency experts remain skeptical that gas-powered Bitcoin mining is really a win for the climate. Alex de Vries, an economist who published a recent paper in the journal Jouleabout Bitcoins massive carbon footprint, said that monetizing flare gas only creates an incentive for more drilling: Youre making fossil fuel mining more profitable, so youre not helping, he said. Alex Trembath, deputy director of the Breakthrough Institute, a clean energy think tank, said that the approach sounds like an incremental improvement over unmitigated flaring. But no matter the power source, he said, its hard to justify Bitcoins enormous energy demand given that it benefits only a relatively tiny group of investors. Flare gas could just as well power carbon capture machines he said, water desalination plants, or data centers that support more widely used applications, like video streaming or email (Crusoe is planning to open some of its data centers to more general cloud computing uses, Cavness said, and has donated data-crunching space to a group that studies Covid-19 protein folding ). What they all have in common is that theres a social value in those things that I dont see for Bitcoin, Trembath said. Bitcoins bubble could soon burst, one of its founders warnedlast week; it has happened before If it does, companies like Wesco will see the profit potential burn off. But with the cheapest power in the crypto mining industrytheir ownthey could at least come out ahead of other miners. There is no price for Bitcoin at which they wont be making money, Gerasymovych said.

Professional artists and amateurs alike jumped [] WhatsApp Navigating the Crypto Art Market: What You Ought to Know Like stocks, bonds, gold or Bitcoins, art holds value. Last year, tokenized or crypto art made waves in art communities and mainstream culture as it caught headlines the world over  but is there tangible value in crypto art? Professional artists and amateurs alike jumped onto the bandwagon of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). A new kind of artwork collector emerged, one that may not understand a lot about art in the traditional sense but see it as a speculative asset to generate future profits. The traditional art market has long been considered a high-risk environment, with multiple factors influencing the value of art pieces. So how risky is the crypto art market to those unfamiliar with the art world? The current state of crypto art market The total value of the crypto art market sits nearly at $444 million at the time of writing. In comparison, the traditional fine art was around $67 billion market in 2018, with 7.4% average annual returns from its highest performer  contemporary art. The NFT art trading volumes reached an all-time-high of $170 million in March, nearly double the total for February, and more than ten times higher than January. The spike is certainly related to one of the most successful and expensive digital art sales when the digital artwork of Mike Winkelmann, professionally known as Beeple, was sold at Christies for $69 million in March. Plenty of other high-ranking digital artists besides Beeple have generated millions from selling their works on various cryptoart trading platforms. According to NFT Report 2020, the distribution between primary and secondary crypto art markets was uneven. The primary market clearly dominated the charts, meaning that crypto art works were sold for the first time and settled in portfolios. Meanwhile, the secondary market, where collectors trade among themselves, remains limited. The market is considered mature when the secondary market becomes the dominant one, indicating that the production of assets has slowed down and peer-to-peer trading is taking over. The quality of crypto art For now, memes, gifs, videos and other digital creations fall under the art category and are selling like hot cakes. As almost anything can be named NFT art these days, how does it affect the aesthtic quality of the crypto art market? The current NFT artist community is certainly enthusiastic and enamored with the technology and the new way of monetizing their works, says Israel-based crypto art curator Alyssa Travis, noting that the quality of the NFT art works varies across different marketplaces. Although this is a bit of a generalization, were witnessing the concentration of the best artists with the largest followings on a handful of curated NFT marketplaces, such as Nifty Gateway or SuperRare. The expert indicated that most popular artists with huge follower bases tend to concentrate on curated NFT marketplaces, such as Nifty Gateway or SuperRare. The more amateur artists, experimenters, or meme-makers are minting their works on marketplaces without a curatorial gatekeeper, like Rarible or OpenSea, said Alyssa and warned if youre searching for NFT art on OpenSea, be prepared to encounter plenty of pixelated, collectible characters, cryptocurrency memes, and amateur art. What determines value in crypto art? Successfully navigating online marketplaces is just the beginning for potential investors. Amidst the ocean of crypto art pieces, how should the inexperienced NFT art collector know what to buy and how much to pay? At the end of the day, says Alyssa Travis, the value of NFT artworks are determined by the same factors that determine the prices of traditional fine art: The notoriety of the artist, value of other works sold by the same artist, scarcity of their work, provenance, historical significance and the amount of work and skill required to produce the work. According to Travis, new collectors should research the artists following and popularity before investing. Review what the artist has sold for previously and consider the prices of artworks for similar artists, she advises, adding that thats one of the beauties of NFT art: all these statistics, including provenance, are readily available to you. Another NFT art curator and collector, Crypt0xNinja from France, recommended following clear criteria when choosing which crypto art piece to invest in. Talented artist. Dope art piece. Good pricing and low editions numbers, he listed, the art piece must be innovative and with the identity. The trap of editions A single edition 1/1 artwork is worth far more than an edition of 1,000, noted Alyssa Travis. According to her, the quantity of editions is a criteria to consider before investing, especially as the prices of large quantity editions appear to be highly inflated. On February 25, Nifty Gateway hosted a 7-minute open edition for Trevor Jones  Angel. People could buy as many editions as they wanted for $777 within that 7-minute window. He sold 4,157 editions, earning $3,229,989. To put this in perspective, Bitcoin Angel 1/1 last sold for around $206K and his most expensive work Genesis sold for $540K Travis explained, although there was a lottery aspect to this open edition with owners being able to potentially receive a commissioned self-portrait or a 1/1 NFT of my Conor McGregor portrait, the price for this large quantity edition appears massively inflated when compared to the prices of his single edition NFTs. Room to grow Currently all sectors of the NFT art market are experiencing rapid growth, says crypto art expert Alyssa Travis, who sees even more room for the crypto market to expand. One of the largest potential areas for growth is the certification and tokenization of physical, analog art, she remarks. Confirming authenticity and provenance has always been an issue in the art world, so NFTs could help provide a solution to this problem. The technology behind NFTs could yet be confusing for traditional fine art creators, thus preventing them from tokenizing their works. However, it is only a matter of time until traditional artists become more familiar with NFTs, as the process is already changing the art world. Brasilian visual artist and collagist Hugo Bastos sold his first NFT artwork just hours after it was minted. In his message to DailyCoin he confirmed the sale came much faster and was more profitable compared to traditional ways of art selling. It was faster than putting an artwork up for licensing on a website or waiting for people to ask for prints of it, said Bastos, and, financially speaking, definitely more worth it. Is crypto art collecting for everyone? Traditionally, art has been seen as a long-term investment; years if not decades. If a fresh and promising artist maintains a successful career and his or her status increases, the value of his or her works climbs up simultaneously. This process can be extremely time-consuming.

107,Nigerians' Appetite For Bitcoins Grows Despite Ban,ibtimes,"Mar 29, 2021",2021-03-29 15:15:16,"Nigerians' appetite for bitcoins grows despite ban Nigerians' Appetite For Bitcoins Grows Despite Ban By Segun OLAKOYENIKAN 03/29/21 AT 11:15 AM When Nigerian office worker Chigoziri Okeke bought cryptocurrency for the first time in 2016, he was only looking to make an online payment. But the 10 percent gain on his wallet's balance after a few days fired up the 27-year-old's interest. Now, the Lagos resident has more than $50,000 worth of different cryptocurrencies. ""After my initial purchase, bitcoin's price spiked a little bit to about $400-$500 per unit,"" Okeke told AFP, smiling at his shining computer screen. ""People told me it cost a dollar at some point. So, that motivated me to start investing a certain portion of my salary in cryptocurrency."" Okeke's experience reflects the reality of many Nigerians who are playing a key role in the global hunt for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the face of the economic crisis bedeviling Africa's most populous nation. Nigeria's central bank has repeatedly warned against the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies and even ordered local banks to close accounts trading in them. But more than $400 million worth of the digital currency was traded in Nigeria in 2020, placing it third globally after the US and Russia, according to global market data tracker Statista. But more than $400 million worth of the digital currency was traded in Nigeria in 2020, placing it third globally after the US and Russia Photo: AFP / INA FASSBENDER ""It is not a big surprise,"" said Andrew Nevin, chief economist for Nigeria at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. ""The naira is under incredible pressure,"" he said referring to Nigeria's often unstable currency. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) devalued the naira twice last year by nearly a quarter in the midst of a dollar shortage that followed a pandemic-induced crash in the prices of crude oil, the country's major export and source of foreign exchange. ""I haven't been able to pay my school fees for the past two weeks,"" said Akudo Okoro, who recently got admission into a Canadian university, echoing the troubles many are facing over the naira. ""The banks are complaining of dollar scarcity."" Bitcoin hits historic high of more than 46,000 dollars recently Photo: AFP / Tupac POINTU In February 2021, the International Monetary Fund said the naira was still overvalued, raising fears of devaluation. A weaker naira could stoke inflation, already at a four-year high of 17.3 percent, and further erode purchasing power of Nigerians. Bitcoin -- the first and largest cryptocurrency -- has returned more than 90 percent gains since the year began. Cryptocurrency gained more traction last October after Nigeria blocked bank accounts of alleged financiers of popular protests against police brutality. Supporters donated bitcoin to the group in charge of raising funds for protesters, a move backed by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Majority of the protesters were young adults under 30, a demographic accounting for more than half of the country's 200 million people. Nigeria's central bank twice devalued the naira last year Photo: AFP / PIUS UTOMI EKPEI Yet, the age group remains largely vulnerable to economic hardships hitting the nation, including a high rate of joblessness that has created a fertile ground for crypto usage to escape poverty. ""Many Nigerians are tech-savvy, young and ready to embrace alternatives to fiat currencies, especially ones like the naira where multiple exchange rates are an encumbrance to doing business and wealth preservation,"" Charlie Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital, told AFP. More than a third of Nigeria's nearly 70-million labour-force population are jobless, and the bulk of the unemployed people are younger than 35 like Adekunle Ahmed who started trading cryptocurrency in 2019. The student of the University of Lagos has since employed two people in his trading business with the hopes of expanding to other sectors, including real estate. ""As an entrepreneur, you have to diversify your portfolio. I want to create more jobs after school and I already have the capital to do that,"" Ahmed told AFP. Governments across the world have introduced regulations to curb the growing demand for the digital asset recently promoted by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The CBN has ordered lenders to stop facilitating cryptocurrency transactions over allegations they were being used for money laundering and terrorism financing. But supporters argued the clampdown would be ignoring the potential for job creation and easing cross-border payments in a country that has endured two economic recessions within five years. ""Solutions like cryptocurrency should have been a way to augment, not replace, the scarcity of dollars in Nigeria,"" said Olusola Amusan, a Dallas-based artificial intelligence activist. ""What the country should be looking at is to create a regulatory framework to be able to provide some forms of guidance to how these cryptocurrencies are traded."" Meanwhile, many investors and traders are still in the business even though some Nigerians complained their bank accounts were closed due to the regulatory crackdown. The use of foreign accounts for crypto purchase and a shift to peer-to-peer-enabled platforms have replaced the services of restricted cryptocurrency exchanges. ""I can buy bitcoin as long as my accounts abroad remain funded,"" said a cryptocurrency trader, who asked for anonymity. ""It's even possible to fund my wallet in Nigeria using platforms with the peer-to-peer feature."" Peer-to-peer allows one party to transfer cryptocurrency to another once an equivalent payment for the digital asset is confirmed by the first party. ""Cryptocurrencies are largely speculative, anonymous and untraceable,"" the CBN warned in February. But innovations such as the peer-to-peer network could keep even more Nigerians in the digital market if the economic crisis bites harder. ""Humans will always find a way around every single regulation you make,"" Amusan said. ""Rather than stifle people, you better create new ways to manage the new appetite."" Copyright AFP.

110,Travel Giant Webjet (WEB:ASX) Enters Crypto through an Unprecedented $4.1M Deal with LockTrip.com  Sponsored Bitcoin News,bitcoin,"Mar 29, 2021",2021-03-29 13:16:11,"Australia-based superbrand Webjet recognizes the value potential of the blockchain startup LockTrip and joins its mission by securing the rights for up to AU$3 Billion for 2020 . The more significant it is to see such a giant and industry leader joining the crypto space through the well known and established blockchain-based company LockTrip and its LOC token. The marriage, as it is called by Nikola Alexandrov, CEO and Co-Founder of LockTrip, is uniquely structured. He comments: The LockTrip/Webjet deal is a testament on how traditional tech giants spot opportunity in blockchain technology. Among the multiple synergies, perhaps the most unique feature of the deal is Webjets commitment to integrate the LockTrip marketplace on its OTA websites. If that condition is met, the LOC economy would be supercharged by the existing business of a global superbrand that has millions of active users. This makes the deal unprecedented in the blockchain space. Supercharging the LOC Economy According to the whitepaper of LockTrip, every booking made on the marketplace results in LOC token being bought from exchanges and permanently burnt, amounting to 3% of the booking value. The fixed supply of less than 18.6 million LOC therefore makes it a deflationary economy. In addition to this, it is also possible to pay for travel bookings directly with LOC to take advantage of the cheapest prices on the marketplace. The deal is now seeking to expand the LOC burn mechanism towards the leading OTA brands of Webjet in Australia and New Zealand, thus capturing the economy of three distinct travel marketplaces. If the integration is successful, this would be a massive step for the advancement of the crypto industry towards real world businesses. According to the announcement, LockTrip.com as a travel marketplace and brand will continue to expand towards the global market and allow users worldwide to save up to 60% on their travel bookings by cutting out middlemen and commissions. Regarding their investment decision, John Guscic, Managing Director of Webjet, says: We first made contact with the LockTrip founders in early 2019 to share views on blockchain, given Webjets blockchain journey with Rezchain. From the initial conversation, we were impressed with the way the founders approached solving the well-known challenges of a public blockchain, and felt they had a game changing opportunity to utilize the fundamental features of blockchain to improve the hotel distribution landscape He then continues: Having identified the exciting potential that Locktrip and Hydra could offer, we began to explore a deeper relationship, which has resulted in todays announcement. We are delighted to be on board with the LockTrip founders offering innovation to travel consumers and suppliers alike Potential Migration of Rezchain onto Hydra Chain The synergies of the deal go far beyond the LOC economy integration to the Webjet OTAs. Arguably, the more significant element of the deal could be the migration of the Rezchain booking verification system onto the Hydra blockchain. Webjet has been investing in their own commercially viable blockchain-based project branded Rezchain , which aims to prevent data mismatches between various suppliers and intermediaries. Rezchain is a private blockchain, with 100% centralized nodes and is fully operational as we speak. This critical infrastructure could now be migrated onto the decentralized infrastructure of the Hydra chain. According to its MasterPlan, the long term mission of LockTrip is about solving pressing problems of the travel industry regarding data mismatch, fragmented supplier relationships and inefficient distribution. These are exactly the core problems we set out to solve by launching LockTrip. To a certain degree, Rezchain was also trying to tackle the same problems that LockTrip identified. Joining our forces through a marriage with Webjet was the logical thing to do. says Nikola Aloxandrov. The long term objective of LockTrip is to launch a distributed database for travel inventory, which could solve many of the problems outlined above. The development of the Hydra chain also had the core purpose of serving this long-term goal, as it comes with all the building blocks needed. Some of these are: Fixed transaction fees in $USD Wallet-level scalability (parallel processing of transactions allows for a single wallet to process hundreds of transactions per block) Network-level scalability with an elastic transaction capacity of up to 540 TPS Support for turing-complete smart contracts Gas royalty for smart contract creators Layer two solution for bigger data amounts Earlier this year, Hydra was launched as a blockchain that offers real-world businesses a platform to join the crypto space. The fixed transaction fees and gas royalty for businesses were mentioned as key features. Lynne Oldfield, Director of Corporate Development at Webjet, comments: Public blockchains are typically slow, resource hungry and have unpredictable pricing; with the release of Hydra chain, the founders of LockTrip provide a robust, scalable platform for genuine commercial applications and we are excited to invest with them as they grow this opportunity If the integration is successful, Rezchain would be the third real-world business to build on Hydra. Aside from Rezchain and LockTrip, a third project named Evedo (EVED token) has also announced that it will be migrating from Ethereum to Hydra later this year. Evedo aims to revolutionize the event industry by connecting parties directly with each other and removing commissions in between. The biggest long-term potential for the deal between LockTrip, Hydra and Webjet lies in the endgame scenario: Tokenizing travel inventory, and thus connecting various suppliers, hotels and marketplaces through a globally accessible distributed travel database. This is a massive vision that could cause tremendous economic shifts across the industry. It is yet to be seen whether the team will be able to accomplish it. The online travel industry grew to more than $700 Billion in 2019. Disrupting such a massive industry will surely not happen overnight. But with Hydra, they have built the tools necessary to make it possible. And with their new partner of Webjet, which is the second biggest travel supplier in the world, they now also have the power to pull it off.",https://news.bitcoin.com/travel-giant-webjet-webasx-enters-crypto-through-an-unprecedented-4-1m-deal-with-locktrip-com/

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.

Gustavo Henrique Ruffo The companys Bitcoin Payment Terms & Conditions make it very clear. The author of The Black Swan and Skin In The Game tweeted about Tesla again. Not to ask for a repair for butt dialing and a proper refundbut to warn about buying a Teslawith bitcoins. Nassim Nicholas Taleb said it could be a terrible deal to do so. His first tweet reminded people of something fundamental: Tesla does not price its cars in bitcoins. It uses dollars. That means the price will have to be converted into bitcoins for the payment to be done. Taleb disputes that bitcoins are a currency, as calling them a cryptocurrency implies. For him, it is a speculative item. But that is far from being the only risk the deal could bring to potential Tesla customers. The author warns about Teslas Bitcoin Payment Terms &amp; Conditions. That document states that Tesla can choose how it will refund customers if they do not want to keep the car: dollars or bitcoins. That implies the carmaker can select the best deal for it. If bitcoins lose a lot of value, Tesla can give you back the bitcoins you used. If they appreciate, the company may refund you with dollars and keep the difference. With such conditions, which you can read here most customers with bitcoins to spend would probably prefer to convert them into money and pay Tesla in dollars. That would ensure they would have no surprises depending on the bitcoins are worth should they have any issues. More Articles About Nassim Nicholas Taleb And Bitcoins: Musk Touts Crypto On Twitter, Tesla Buys $1.5 Billion In Bitcoin Although it may seem unlikely to Tesla customers, we have already seen quite a few cases of buybacks involving vehicles from the brand in the US or abroad, in places like Norwayand China Since bitcoin payments are only available for customers on American soil, they are the ones who should be aware of these ""terms & conditions.""

137,2021s top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest By BTC Peers,investing,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 00:00:00,"2021s top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest 2021s top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest The crypto derivatives market has grown by leaps and bounds in 2021, with digital assets exchange platforms reporting record-high trading activities. Notably, the growth of the derivatives market is exemplified by the growing demand for Bitcoin futures contracts. The global open contract, which was worth $3 billion back in January 2020, has surpassed the $22 billion mark, according to skew.com. With this in mind, it has become necessary to evaluate the explosiveness of the crypto derivatives market by analyzing the shares of digital asset exchanges using open interest as the standard measure. Note that we have opted for open interest metrics because it paints a clearer picture of trading activities and it provides an accurate means of measuring the flow of money into a derivatives market. Here are the top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest. OKExLaunched in 2017, OKEx remains one of the oldest and most reputable crypto exchanges. Over the years, OKEx has adapted to emerging trends and has continued to feature prominently in the top echelon of the crypto exchange market. The exchange offers traders a variety of ways to engage with the crypto market, including a budding derivatives market, and other crypto finance offerings. For the better part of 2020, OKEx emerged as the largest crypto derivatives exchange as a result of its competitive derivatives products and fees. With OKEx, traders can access perpetual contracts, futures, and options all on one platform. As a result, OKEx has maintained its high-flying status, regardless of the emergence of formidable competitors in 2021. According to data from The Block, OKEx accounts for 13.79% of global open interest for BTC futures worth over $3 billion and averages 24-hour futures open interest worth $4 billion. As such, it is currently the 3rd biggest Bitcoin futures exchange globally. BinanceBinance is popularly known for its strategic listings and relatively low fees. Remarkably, the exchange has managed to replicate this formula in its derivatives market to great effects. Earlier this year, Binance stamped its dominance in the BTC futures market by accounting for over $4 billion worth of open interest equivalent to 18.22% of the global tally. The 24-hour open interest of Binances futures is currently above $9 billion. One of the compelling selling points of Binance is its low trading fees set at 0.02% and 0.04% for maker and taker fees respectively. Also, traders get to access up to 125X leverage, depending on their affinity for risks. These features, combined with the established status of Binance in the spot trading market, have propelled its derivatives products to success. BybitBybit has carved a name for itself in the crypto derivatives market in just under 3 years of operations. The exchange currently averages 24-hour trading volume worth $20 billion and accounts for 15.66%, or $3.59 billion, of the global tally of open interest for BTC futures. At the time of writing, the 24-hour open interest of its futures market is around $4.3 billion. The rise of the Asia-based exchange in the global rankings indicates the growth of retail participation in the crypto derivatives market. 70% of Bybits clientele are reportedly retail traders while the other 30% are institutional accounts. Another propelling factor might be its referral program launched in January 2021. Bybit pays a $10 bonus to new and existing users participating in the referral scheme as part of its ongoing growth inducement strategies. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)Dubbed the ideal option for institutional investors interested in crypto derivative products, CME remains one of the contributing factors to crypto mainstream adoption. Its existing status in the traditional finance terrain has played a pivotal role in its growing dominance in the crypto derivatives market. The exchange momentarily emerged as the largest bitcoin futures exchange in December only to slip to 4th place following the explosive rise of the market shares of OKEx, Binance, and Bybit. It is also worth mentioning that the crypto derivatives trading activities recorded on CME reflect the demand for crypto products by institutional traders. However, this notion might become redundant in the coming months as CME plans to launch Micro Bitcoin futures suitable for retail clients. Huobi GlobalMuch like the exchanges listed above, Huobi delivers a wide array of trading options that are available globally. Huobis growing appeal boils down to its capacity to process high volumes of trades without worrying about slippages. It has ensured that this same high level of liquidity reflects in its derivatives market as the exchange records an average trading volume of $22 billion. Also, it has its standard maker and taker fees set at 0.02% and 0.04% respectively. In terms of open interest, Huobi ranks as the 5th largest Bitcoin futures exchange, according to the data from skew.com. The exchange currently boasts an open interest of $2.4 billion for BTC futures, representing 10.79% of the global Bitcoin futures market. DeribitDeribit is another high flyer in the emerging crypto derivatives market. Like Bybit, Deribit is one of the few prominent exchanges that focus solely on providing crypto derivatives products. Note that Deribit features just 33 Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives products. Nonetheless, it remains one of the most prominent options for both retail and institutional traders. Besides, the possibility of opening anonymous accounts makes it appealing to privacy-focused traders. According to Coingecko, Deribit processes over $1 billion worth of trading volume daily, thereby cementing its place in the top 10 list of crypto derivatives exchanges by volume. More importantly, it accounts for $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin-futures open interest and averages $1.8 billion 24-hour open interest. Therefore, Deribit is the 7th on the list of the top 10 bitcoin futures market and top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest. FTXWith its 24-hour open interest averaging $5.2 billion, FTX provides sophisticated trading tools for over 150 perpetual and quarterly futures markets. Although it is a relatively new exchange, it has positioned itself for unprecedented growth by delivering consumer-centric and innovative products ranging from the basic to the highly technical. For example, Move, one of its derivative products, allows users to speculate on the daily, weekly, or even quarterly changes in the price of cryptocurrencies. As a result of FTXs penchant for innovation, the exchange has emerged as the 6th largest Bitcoin futures exchange globally, accounting for over 10% of the global bitcoin-futures open interest of $22 billion. BitmexOnce the largest crypto derivative exchange, Bitmex excelled as one of the long-standing privacy-focused crypto derivatives markets available globally. However, due to the increased regulatory scrutiny, Bitmex has begun to enforce KYC require",http://investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/2021s-top-10-crypto-derivatives-exchanges-by-open-interest-2473837

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.

146,Bitcoin Bubble? 148 BTC Bears Who Think This Crypto Is Going to Crash,investorplace,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 18:29:02,"Depite rising to all-time highs in recent days, fears of a Bitcoin bubble appear to be forming among institutional investors today. Apr 13, 2021, 2:29 pm EDT April 13, 2021 Today, sentiment in the cryptocurrency space remains optimistic. Investors have pushed Bitcoin (CCC: BTC-USD ) to fresh all-time highsof more than $63,000 as this trade continues to pick up steam. However, concerns about a potentialBitcoin bubble appear to be starting to form. Source: Shutterstock Interestingly, the higher Bitcoin goes, the greater the number of institutional investors who believe a bubble is forming. A recent reportby CNBC indicates that 74% of a survey of 200 panelists in a Bank of Americasurvey suggest Bitcoin is in a bubble. Those surveyed happen to know what theyre talking about. Indeed, the group reportedly has more than $500 billion in assets under management. This percentage works out to 148 bears out of 200 respondents. Around 20 respondents said they think Bitcoin will continue to outperform. However, the ratio is quite astonishing. Heres more on whats being reported on this potential bubble in Bitcoin today. Bitcoin Bubble Fears Forming In addition to the aforementioned survey, a number of high-profile bears have emerged of late. One such bear that caught my eye is Bobby Lee, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange BTCC. In a recent CNBC interview Mr. Lee was quoted as saying So after it peaks out, whether its $200,000, $100,000, or $300,000, people should be aware that it could fall as much as 80% to 90% of its value from the all-time peak. Now, a near-term price target in the six-digit range is nothing we havent seen before. However, this suggestion that Bitcoin could lose 80%-90% of its value seems to be of concern to bulls today. Another Bitcoin insider Calvin Ayre has also commented on Bitcoins potential demise. In a tweet he suggested Bitcoin could drop to zero, due to an inability to scale. Additionally, two of the greatest investors of all time, Warren Buffett and business partner Charlie Munger, have denouncedBitcoin as an investment. These two investors have been bears for some time on Bitcoin, though long-term investors tend to follow their advice, given their track records. Buffett called Bitcoin rat poison, while Munger echoed this sentiment, calling Bitcoin turds. Thats a pretty strong take on Bitcoin from two iconic investors. These takes are all strong ones, to be sure. Indeed, investors in Bitcoin have a lot to take in right now. For those listening to the smart money, it is important to consider the Bitcoin bubble rumors brewing.

Read more here. Bitcoin snaps new record high a day before Coinbase goes public Author: Last Updated: April 13, 2021 Bitcoin is posting a fresh all-time high today in early cryptocurrency tradingaction as bullish sentiment seems to be preceding the launch of Coinbases stock to the open market  an event that is scheduled to take place tomorrow. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is up 4.6% so far at $62,590, its highest daily performance since 26 March, while other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH)and Ripple (XRP) are up 3.6% and 15% respectively. Meanwhile, based on this mornings data from CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has also posted a new record, currently landing at $2.15 trillion while the market as a whole, excluding Bitcoin (BTC) is nearing the $1 trillion mark for the first time in history. This latest jump in the value of cryptocurrencies seems to be fueled by the upcoming listing of one of the worlds largest crypto exchanges Coinbase, which is scheduled to launch its sharesto the open market via direct listing tomorrow. In the past few weeks, private auctions of Coinbases shares have resulted in a valuation higher than $100 billion for the company founded by former Airbnb engineer Brian Armstrong and ex-Goldman Sachs trader Fred Ehrsam, with the company recently reportinga surge in revenue, trading volumes, and assets on platform during the first quarter of this year that single-handedly shadowed its financial performance in 2021. In the first three months of 2021 alone, more than $335 billion in crypto transactions were settled through Coinbase, while the number of verified users registered with the platform jumped from 43 million to 56 million. Meanwhile, a total of $223 million in assets are currently held on the platform, representing 11.3% of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies and a 158% jump compared to last years figures. Crypto advocates believe that Coinbases listing is a positive step for crypto assets to keep clearing regulatory hurdles, while many financial services firms have been moving to list vehicles, including exchange-traded funds (ETF) through which investors can get exposure to digital currencies as is the case of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both of which have reportedly sought the approval of said vehicles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In other Bitcoin-related news, British bank HSBC recently banned customers from buying MicroStrategy shares, citing that the company has become a vehicle through which individuals can buy Bitcoinsince around 80% of the market capitalization of the firm headed by crypto advocate Michael J. Saylor is pegged to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. HSBC has no appetite for direct exposure to virtual currencies and limited appetite to facilitate products or securities that derive their value from VCs (virtual currencies), said the bank in a statement first viewed by Reuters Whats next for Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin-to-USD (BTC/USD) price chart  1-day candles view with multiple indicators  Source: TradingView Todays resistance break for Bitcoin (BTC) could represent the beginning of a fresh short-term bullish cycle, with a first target set at $66,800 based on the trend line resistance highlighted in the chart. Meanwhile, todays jump seems to be reversing the long-dated bearish divergence seen in both the RSI and the MACD as positive momentum for the coin appears to be picking up again. Moreover, it would plausible to think that a successful first day of trading for Coinbase could lift BTCs price to $70,000 on short notice.

155,Why the IRS Is Taxing Bitcoins as an Asset -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 10:31:00,"The IRS taxes Bitcoins as an asset rather than a currency. Is this a clever move that could stabilize the currency, or is this the opening salvo in a battle that its doomed to lose? ) Mar 26, 2014 at 11:31AM The U.S. government recently took its first steps in regulating Bitcoin, the world's top cryptocurrency, but it wasn't through the tighter regulation of its exchanges and businesses. Instead, the IRS announced that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies will be taxed as a property and not as a currency. In other words, Bitcoin is now the same as a stock, bond, or real estate for tax purposes, and would be subject to capital tax gains when sold at a profit. Therefore, any payments received in Bitcoins and all personally mined Bitcoins now need to be reported to the IRS through forms W-2 or 1099 and taxed accordingly. (Source: Flickr) By comparison, if Bitcoin were treated as a regular foreign currency, only ordinary tax rates, not capital gains taxes, would apply. For example, if you purchase a $4 slice of pizza for Bitcoins originally acquired for $2, it will trigger $2 in capital gains for you and $4 in gross income for the pizza shop. Add local sales tax into that equation, and you get a messy calculation that makes a simple cash transaction seem more reasonable. According to the new IRS regulations, Bitcoin capital gains will be taxed at lower rate if held for a longer period of time, with a maximum rate of 23.8% for long-term gains and 43.4% for short-term ones. The new rule allows U.S. taxpayers to write off their losses from failed Bitcoin exchanges as capital losses. What's the government's strategy? The government is approaching Bitcoin from two angles. First, taxing transactions of Bitcoin, which has risen more than 500% over the past year, could be a good way to grow the government coffers. The government has already started cracking down on overseas transactions with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) which requires foreign financial institutions to report the holdings of their American clients to the IRS. Since Bitcoin is gaining ground as an anonymous currency without borders, the IRS is clearly concerned about the potential loss of tax revenue. Second, Bitcoin has been implicated in money laundering and sales of illegal drugs in online black markets like Silk Road. Therefore, it would make sense to throttle the adoption of the virtual currency by slapping every transaction with tax forms. Reducing the volume of transactions could also reduce Bitcoin's volatility -- a key hurdlethat keeps it from being accepted as a mainstream currency. Is the IRS naive to think virtual currency taxes will work?

Imports jumped 38.1%, beating expectations and leaving a trade surplus of $13.8 billion for the month.China has benefited from soaring global demand for medical goods and work-from-home equipment during the pandemic. The latest data shows export momentum remained strong after record gains in February, a sign that the global rebound is helping spur demand in the worlds second-largest economy.The World Trade Organization last month raised its forecast for global trade growth to 8% this year, which would be the fastest pace since 2010.Export outperformance remains a theme in Chinas recovery, Peiqian Liu, an economist at Natwest Markets, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV, adding that it was due to a combination of global recovering demand as well as Chinas role in filling up the global supply chain gaps.The trade figures are also partly distorted because of last years low base, when the pandemic shut down much of the economy. Premier Li Keqiang told experts and enterprises on the weekend to look beyond the base effect and use other data and methods to assess the economic situation.The surge in imports reflects strong domestic activity and rising commodity prices, further signs of Chinas solid recovery from last years pandemic. Data due Friday will probably show the economy expanded a record 18.5% in the first quarter from a year ago.Analysts are watching closely to see if China can sustain its export growth as demand for pandemic-related goods ease and production elsewhere picks up. Economists at Societe Generale SA also point out that in the second half of the year, consumers may switch to spending on services instead of goods, a shift that could weigh on Chinas exports.What Bloomberg Economics Says...Chinas strong export growth in March shows demand from overseas continues to support the economy.

Sorrento owns around 99% of Scilex Holding. Sorrento Therapeutics (SRNE) subsidiary, Scilex Holdings Chief Medical Officer, Dmitri Lissin, MD, said, We are very pleased with the trial outcome and labeling revision that attests to characteristics of ZTlido superior to other topical systems, to give patients a more reliable and uninterrupted drug delivery to alleviate pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia. ZTlido is a polymer-based lidocaine topical drug that will now have an FDA-approved label reflecting its usage while showering, bathing and swimming. Scilexs clinical trial of ZTlido indicated that the drug on immersing in water, can be successfully reapplied and could remain on the skin for upto 12 hours, cause benign skin irritation and could also be used while showering. (See Sorrento Therapeutics stock analysis on TipRanks) Last week, Dawson James analyst Jason Kolbert reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $19 on the stock. Kolbert commented on SRNEs $38 million acquisition of Acea Therapeutics, ACEA brings to Sorrento Abivertinib (oral), a next generation, dual EGFR mutant [Estimated glomerular filtration rate] and BTK [Brutons tyrosine kinase] inhibitor (BTKi) with a completed NSCLC [Non-small-cell lung carcinoma] registrational/Phase 3 trial. The compound is also in a Phase 1 B-cell lymphoma study, ongoing Phase 2 trials in COVID-19 patients with ARDS [Acute respiratory distress syndrome], and Phase 2 studies for prostate cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus and the ultra-orphan indication of hairy cell leukemia. We also note that ACEA brings a state-of-the-art cGMP [Current Good Manufacturing Practice] facility located in Quzhou, China, on a 23-acre campus with five buildings, Kolbert added. Overall, the rest of the Street is bullish on the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys.

That being said, both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnsons (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. Well get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal, but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March, up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that its up isnt too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately, but its good to see its only a little above expectations. Thats in contrast to last Fridays producer price index, which came in way, way, above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJs Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isnt great news, obviously, but its nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer, and this might slow the momentum, but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also, people shouldnt think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine, but it isnt surprising that a complication got reported, simply because vaccines arent widgets. Like any medical product, theyre complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. Its a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted out of an abundance of caution. Its unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this, but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S., and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back, but in a worst-case scenario its off the market for an extended period, putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the reopening stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning were seeing shares of airlines, casinos, and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Streets attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure, a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear, but its nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile, volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62,000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up, but still below 17.5, which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless theres big news out of the FDA press conference, trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrows onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope, youre not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this years reopening darlings like airlines, energy companies, and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before todays JNJ vaccine news, remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news, with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products, which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday, but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while, the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industrys efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago, so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that, trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS), and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always, investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading, where theres often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season, FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1, so things are definitely looking up. In fact, the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will, 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called cyclicals like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop Theres always a caveat, and heres one: The Covid situation isnt really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend, telling 60 Minutes that hes concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course, there was todays bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing, watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths ca",http://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-btc-moves-above-60-073700240.html

165,Bitcoin a caged bull with little resistance ahead as BTC still in price discovery mode,fxstreet,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 02:57:43,"Bitcoin price continues to struggle to reach a record high above $60,000. However, BTC demand and on-chain data suggest a bullish outlook for the pion | 4/13/2021 2:57:43 AM GMT Bitcoin miners continue to accumulate the cryptocurrency as we approach the halfway point in the BTC bull run. Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone indicates Bitcoin is in price discovery, far from reaching the cycle top. Galaxy Digital joins the latest race to offer an approved Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Bitcoin price continues to struggleto reach a record high above $60,000. However, BTC demand and on-chain data suggest a bullish outlook for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Bitcoin to see continued price appreciation The amount of Bitcoin held in exchange wallets has been in decline, which means that investors are now hodling their BTC and are in no rush to deposit to sell their cryptocurrencies. Long-term holders and Bitcoin miners have started to accumulateBitcoin, which reflects the low outflow of Bitcoin entering the market. According to analyst Willy Woo, Miners has also surpassed their 2017 bull run revenues, which marks as the halfway point in the Bitcoin bull run. As such, it is intermission time while Bitcoins bull market top points to a target above $300,000, Woo stated. Adding to the optimism for a new Bitcoin price all-time high, senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone said the cryptocurrency has far to go before it reaches a cycle top. McGlone described Bitcoins current sideways movement as a caged bull, and with the declining supply and increased demand from institutions, he expects BTC to see continued price appreciation. He explained: Still in Price-Discovery Mode, Bitcoin Plateau Appears Distant  Bitcoin supply is declining, and demand is rising, leading us to expect continued price appreciation and the establishment of a higher plateau as the crypto matures. According to McGlone, Bitcoin is a caged bull and is well-rested to escape. McGlone and other Bloomberg researchers set a bullish target for BTC price at $400,000 if the cryptocurrency follows the trends in previous bull runs. Additionally, the Bloomberg strategists outlined $50,000 as baseline support and acknowledged $60,000 as the key resistance in Bitcoins price climb. However, this resistance level could be eroding as massive institutional adoption continues. The IntoTheBlock In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) data shows almost no resistance ahead. On the other hand, the data shows strength in support between $59,362 to $60,267. However, if this level were to be lost, there is also massive support between $57,552 to $58,457, with over 1.41 million addresses buying 494,800 BTC. Bitcoin IOMAP chart Although the market sentimentaround Bitcoin on social media platform Twitter has been negative, according to crypto behavioral analytics firm Santiment, this could indicate an increased likelihood of a price surge. Bitcoin and Ethereum sentiment levels Galaxy Digital joins the race to offer SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF While Bitcoin price has still yet to overcome its hurdle to rally higher, fundamentals, including its continued depletion of supply and rising demand from institutional investors, could make a case for an anticipated bull run. The market has witnessed growing excitement in anticipation of the Coinbase direct listing scheduled for April 14 and the growing number of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the United States Galaxy Digital has become the latest to file a Bitcoin ETF a fund that offers BTC exposure to institutional investors without holding the underlying asset. Currently, Galaxy is already acting as a sub-advisor to a Canadian Bitcoin ETF by CI Financial, which began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in March. The filing for a Bitcoin ETF with the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) comes following a solid Q4 report from the firm. Galaxy has witnessed growth across asset management, trading, and mining. The crypto banks filing follows several other submissions, including NYDIG, Fidelity, First Trust and SkyBridge The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada and Brazil could pressure US regulators into following in the same footsteps, which Bloomberg indicated as another bullish milestone for Bitcoin.

After three months of consolidation, buyers have finally regained strength. Support is seen around the breakout zone of $60,000, which should be monitored for confirmation. The broader uptrend in BTC remains intact despite slowing momentum on the daily price chart. Buyers have remained active at higher support levels since March, although profit taking at intraday overbought zones signaled a period of indecision. BTC has maintained trend support on both the four-hour and daily chart, which should trigger upside volatility. BTC is now overbought on intraday charts and could remain in that phase during strong breakouts. BTC still faces less upside momentum on the weekly chart, which continues to diverge from the near two-fold price increase since January. However, given the breakout, resistance is now seen around $68,000-$70,000. Related Stories What Would Bidens Tax Hikes Mean for Bitcoin?

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.

175,Central Bank of Nigeria Blocks Fintech Startups From Accessing KYC Service Decision Described as an 'Attack on All Fintechs'  Regulation Bitcoin News,bitcoin,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 18:05:06,"The Central Bank of Nigeria has suspended the provision of the bank validation number (BVN) service to all fintech and third-party partners. Terence Zimwara 5 hours ago Central Bank of Nigeria Blocks Fintech Startups From Accessing KYC Service Decision Described as an 'Attack on All Fintechs' The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has recently suspended the provision of the bank validation number (BVN) service to all fintech and third-party partners. The decision means non-banks entities include crypto startups have lost one of the most comprehensive means of identity verification in the country. New Identification System Before the latest decision, the CBN accepted the use of the BVN alongside any other acceptable identity documents for KYC purposes. According to the apex bank, this service helped to check risk and determine whether or not there is an element of money laundering, fraud and other corruption-related activities. However, as one local media reportexplains, the central banks sudden decision may be linked to the Federal governments determination to change Nigerias identification system. The report says: Over the last few months, the Federal government has been changing the unique means of identification of all agencies, parastatal and industries to National Identification Numbers (NIN). Examples include UTME/ JAMB registration, voter registration, Banks and SIM cards. Nevertheless, the report still warns that the removal of the BVN service could potentially increase the cost of onboarding customers. Following reports of the suspension of the BVN service, Bitcoin.com News sought the views of some players in Nigerias crypto industry. Most of the players agree the suspension is not specifically targeted at the crypto industry. However, some are adamant the move is just a continuation of CBN policies that seek to stifle innovation and to block young people from participating in the economy. Nathaniel Luz, a cryptocurrency thought leader, characterizes the CBNs latest decision as a clash between old and new money. He adds that the suspension of the BVN service shows that the CBN continues to use the same playbook to frustrate the Nigerian youth. In a poston Facebook, Luz wrote: There is a handwriting on the wall the fact that most traders on the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) are over 50 years and there is no pipeline for young people flowing. Old men are trying to use every means possible to frustrate new money guys from economic independence. This is very specific, knowing that this is a decade where we expect a global shift/wealth transfer. An Attack on Fintechs In the meantime, another crypto space leader, Chiagozie Iwu, a CEO of a local crypto exchange expressed surprise at the CBNs decision to suspend the use of the BVN service for verification. He said while crypto and fintech start-ups have, with the aid of the BVN service, been trying to make the space (fintech and crypto space) cleaner, the suspension of the service removes the ability to do the KYC on users. Iwu offers his thoughts on why the CBN made the decision: It is becoming very obvious that they just looking for every way of attacking fintechs (both crypto and non-crypto). Iwu suggests that because some fintech start-ups like Flutterwave now handle volumes which banks can only dream of, the CBN is now coming to the aid of banks via the suspension of the BVN service. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, the CBN had still not disclosed its reasons for the suspension of the BVN service. Bitcoin.com News will update readers once the CBN explains the reasons for the suspension. What are your thoughts on the CBNs decision to suspend the BVN service?

177,3 Cryptocurrencies Look Bullish With Bitcoin Above $60k,benzinga,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 17:19:38,"Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) surpassed and has so far held, above $60,000 and a number of popular alt-coins look set for a bullish week. License Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) surpassed and has so far held, above $60,000 and a number of popular alt-coins look set for a bullish week. When charting cryptocurrencies there are many different chart options and pairs. Many traders and investors prefer to use charts from high-volume exchanges such as Bittrex and Kraken. See Also: How To Buy Bitcoin Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) got a boost this weekend afterElon Musk pumped itin a tweet. On the four-hour chart, Dogecoin has been consolidating since reaching a nine-week high of $0.079 on Sunday. Dogecoin is trading in a bullish descending channel above support at $0.07 and above both the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the 21-day EMA. Bulls want to see Dogecoin break up through the upper sloping line of the descending channel. If Dogecoin can break up out of the channel, it has room to move to its next resistance level of $0.079 and if it can bust up over that it can trade back its all-time high range. Bears want to see Dogecoin continue trading down in the descending channel until it loses support at $0.07. Energy Web Token (CRYPTO: EWT) is being held down by a descending trendline on the four-hour chart and is fighting to keep above resistance of $16.74. Stocks and cryptocurrencies often have repetition on their charts and Energy Web Token traded under a similar descending trendline from March 28 to April 5 before breaking up through it. Bulls want to see a second bullish reaction to the descending trendline. If Energy Web Token can break up above the sloping line, it can hit the next resistance level of $17.92. Bears want to see it continue to trend downwards for it to lose support at $16.74. Ripple (CRYPTO: XRP) broke bullish on Saturday and jumped up over a resistance level of $1.09 that had been holding it down since February 2018. After reaching a three-year high of $1.49 on Sunday, Ripple has been consolidating in what appears to be a bull flag on the four-hour chart. Ripple is trading above both the 8 and 21-day EMAs which is bullish. Although it may be a bit extended from the 21-day EMA on the four-hour chart, a few more hours of consolidation in the bull flag would help both EMAs to catch up to the share price. Bulls want to see Ripple break up above the upper descending trendline of the flag and over the $1.49 level of resistance made on Sunday for a move back into the $2 range. Bears want to see Ripple trend down in the descending channel or for it to break down below the channel to see it drop down to the $1.10 mark.  2020 Benzinga.com.

179,A Short Guide to Understanding Bitcoins,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 17:00:00,"The run-up in price has sparked interest in the nascent digital currency. What is it? ) Mar 26, 2013 at 6:00PM ""Bitcoins"" either sound like a futuristic, implantable, laser-guided, and rocket-pack equipped form of money, or the latest coin-shaped chocolate snack. In reality, it's probably a bit of both. The bitcoin, a digital currency, started the year worth about $15. Less than four months later, one bitcoin now trades above $70. While this past performance may be enticing and a sign of its legitimacy as a future currency, the bitcoin market is full of risks -- risks that may make bitcoins worth as much as a foil-wrapped piece of sugar. Source: bitcoincharts.com. Bitcoin: a crypto-currency Bitcoin is based around the idea of a currency created and transacted through cryptography instead of issued and tracked through a central bank. And to add to its mystique, the creator of bitcoin only goes by a pseudonym and has never been positively identified. Instead of any legal authority, bitcoin transactions are verified through peer-to-peer interactions. If a user sends bitcoins to another user's ""wallet"" file, that transaction is verified through other users, and is written into the collective transaction log. And given the ease of transactions, any fees for transfers are minimal. Instead of a mint, bitcoins are created through a process called ""mining,"" where computers attempt to solve for a certain number, and once found, are rewarded with new bitcoins. The rewards decrease with time, however, and there will only ever be about 21 million bitcoins created, three-quarters of which by 2016, and all by 2140. Even if you don't understand any of the above, the recent jump in valuation probably still has your interest. But there are plenty of reasons to continue to educate yourself before attempting to trade in bitcoins. Glitches Not having any legal regulation, bitcoin has attracted plenty of thieves through the websites that create trading markets: In 2011, the third-largest trading site, Bitomat, lost its wallet file, which held 17,000 bitcoins worth more than $200,000 at the time. In the same year, the exchange MyBitcoin lost 51% of its users' deposits, amounting to 78,000 bitcoins worth over $1 million at the time . In 2012, Bitcoinica was hacked and lost $220,000 worth of customer funds. Two months later, it was hacked again and lost another $90,000. As Bitcoinica attempted to repay claims, the company was hacked a final time for another loss of $320,000. In the fall of 2012, in what might have been the first Bitcoin Ponzi scheme, the creator of Bitcoin Savings and Trust promised returns to investors. The founder has since disappeared with 500,000 bitcoins. Price instability The market forces behind the bitcoin are far from solid and predictable. There is a large demand from speculators while actual use of bitcoins for trading goods and services is small. Just last week, a young Canadian became the first to list his home in exchange for bitcoins, and most other places that accept bitcoins remain small online businesses. And as bitcoin's value continues to swing wildly, it makes it hard for businesses to accept bitcoins with confidence. Meanwhile, established companies have taken notice of bitcoin. The popular blogging platform WordPress announced last November that it would accept bitcoins, while deriding eBay's ( NASDAQ:EBAY ) PayPal platform for blocking access from over 60 countries: ""Some are blocked for political reasons, some because of higher fraud rates, and some for financial reasons. Whatever the reason, we don;t think an individual blogger from Haiti, Ethiopia, or Kenya should have diminished access to the blogosphere because of payment issues they can't control."" If bitcoin ends up taking the role of PayPal in those blocked countries, future growth for eBay could be limited. Other companies have been fighting to become the consumer's digital wallet. Visa ( NYSE:V ) launched its V.me platform last November, which allows users to pay online without repeatedly entering in credit card and shipping information. Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) Wallet breaks away from purely digital shopping, and allows users to use their phone, if it has near-field communication technology, to pay for goods in-store. Unfortunately, many phones -- like the iPhone -- have yet to come equipped with NFC, and less than 10% of retailers are estimated to use NFC. Legality As bitcoin has gained popularity, the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network recently issued a statement clarifying that even virtual currencies like bitcoin are subject to regulation. As bitcoin can be exchanged between anonymous parties, it could be used for illicit activities with little trace. Bitcoin is already a popular currency on what's called Silk Road, a website accessible only through anonymous Internet connections that acts as a marketplace for many illegal substances. In addition, bitcoin is the first major digital currency with no backing from a state nor physical presence. Unlike gold, which exists in physical form and has some actual applications, bitcoin is made up of data, and all value is solely what we perceive. If world governments decide to fight the currency, it could severely hurt any value bitcoin holds. If humans begin to change their mind on what these bits of data are worth, then it could also hurt bitcoin's value. A story to watch, not be a part of Bitcoins are fascinating, for mathematicians, economists, traders, investors, politicians, regulators, and anarchists. And while watching the currency develop is entertaining, the experimental currency is no place for serious investing given the risk versus reward. Attempting to trade in established currencies is difficult enough. Author",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/03/26/a-short-guide-to-understanding-bitcoins.aspx

Many alt coins are also pushing new all-time highs and the value of this entire new asset class stands at $2 trillion, and BTC dominance has fallen to just 56%.  Now that crypto-assets are becoming more mainstream, large cap coins and tokensare big magnets for investors with direct market access.  Investment trusts and funds are announcing additions to their product line up or inclusion in their offerings.

BTC/USD chart by TradingView Today, Bitcoin (BTC)is trading above the $60,000mark. If the volume of purchases manages to increase, then the bulls will continue to rise above the April high andtry to renew the absolute record set at around $61,700. On the other hand, bears may resume large sell-offs and pull the pair back to the support area of $57,000. Bitcoin is trading at $60,080 at press time. ETH/USD The Ethereum (ETH) price over the weekend renewed its absolute maximum around $2,200and settled in a narrow sideways range above the level of the two-hour moving average EMA55. ETH/USD chart by TradingView By the beginning of this week, trading volumes have decreased and buyers' efforts to continue to rise to a new high are limited by resistance at $2,160. If this resistance is broken, then a new all-time record will be located in the area of $2,250. Otherwise, sellers will try to pull back the Ether price, but one hopes that the support of the upward trendline will stop the decline. Ethereum is trading at $2,133 at press time.

The asset returned to the CoinMarketCap's top five rating in terms of capitalization and now occupies the fourth line on this list. By the beginning of this week, the XRP/USD pair rolled back to the $1.30 areaand, if the selling pressure increases, the price might return to the level of $1.20.

The rate of the native exchange token has rocketed by more than 20% over the last day. On the daily chart, Binance Coin (BNB) is already oversold, which means that a slight correction mayhappen soon. In this case, one might expect a decline to the nearest level around $536 shortly. Binance Coin is trading at $575 at press time. ADA/USD Cardano (ADA) is not an exception to the rule as the rate of the altcoin has gone up by 4%.

While the current market outlook is falling short of the bullish momentum recorded over the weekend, Bitcoin is paring off some of its gains in condescension to the market bears. Ethereum is fighting for balance after hitting a new All-Time High (ATH) earlier today. For Bitcoin, the market sentimentat the time of writing is slightly bearish as Ethereum strives to steady its gait amidst impending sell-offs. Bitcoin bears requesting a takeover Bitcoin is currently exchanging hands at $60215.0, up 1.12% according to data provided by the CEX.IO price feed. The anticipation of the public debut of major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been inked as a win for Bitcoin as it represents the flagship innovation upon which the entire industry is built. However, investment in either Coinbase shares or Bitcoin may stir a split of interest amongst institutional and retail investors alike. The position of the broader market investors is a bit divisive as shown in the 4-hour BTC-USD chart on TradingView shown above. The small bullish candle forming at the tail end of the chart is eroding the drag-down effects of the previous bearish candle. This rejection of the bear pressure is unstable at present and though the short-term Moving Average indicator is bullish alongside the Chaikin Money Flow indicator, the bears may force a close below the $60,000 support zone. However, resistance by the bull may retrace the course and set the price close to $61,500 in the coming days. Ethereum taking a breather after ATH surge Ethereum is changing hands at $2145.92, up 0.06% in the past 24 hours. This price comes after the coin surged to a new ATH of $2,199.72 earlier today. At present, Ethereumis generally seeing a healthy retracement as shown in the ETH-USD 4-hour chart below. A concentration of selling activities at the $2,120 point will push the price back below the $2,100 support. This may however serve as a springboard for a break above $2,200 in the near term.

185,Riot Blockchain Stock Surges After Mining Almost 500 Bitcoins in the First Quarter,nasdaq,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 12:00:00,"What happenedShares of cryptocurrency miner Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) surged on Monday after the company gave investors a mining update for the first quarter. The company said it mined 75% more Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) tokens than it did last year, and that has the market excit tokens than it did last year, and that has the market excited. As of 11 a.m. EDT today, Riot Blockchain stock was up 8%. So what According to today's press release, Riot Blockchain mined 491 Bitcoins in the first quarter, with 187 of those coming in March alone. This was a notable increase from last year. First-quarter Bitcoin production was up 75% from the same period in 2020, and production in March was up 80% year over year. Image source: Getty Images. This is particularly noteworthy because it was twice as easy to mine Bitcoin last year, so to speak. Every few years, the Bitcoin network has what's called a ""halving event."" When Bitcoin reaches a halving date, the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half. Miners do the same amount of work, but don't get the same payout. Since May 2020, miners have been getting just 6.25 Bitcoin tokens per block mined. Therefore, Riot Blockchain has increased its computing power enough to not only compensate for the halving event but also take Bitcoin mining share. This can be measured with something called a ""hash rate."" The company ended 2019 with a hash rate of around 100 peta-hashes per second (PH/s) whereas the total hash rate of Bitcoin was around 100 thousand PH/s, according to Blockchain.com. Now, Riot Blockchain's hash rate is expected to reach 1,600 PH/s by the end of this month while the total hash rate of the network is around 172,000 PH/s. From these numbers, it's clear to see Riot Blockchain's growth is outpacing the growth of the network. Mining share is important. The amount of Bitcoin tokens that can be mined is fixed. So Bitcoin miners are paid relative to the amount of hash rate they provide the network. With Riot Blockchain increasing its share, its payouts are also increasing, which is why investors are excited today. Image source: Getty Images. Now what Riot Blockchain isn't settling for its hash rate of 1,600 PH/s, and for good reason. With the price of Bitcoin now over $60,000, many miners are actively buying new mining machines in hopes of getting more of this valuable cryptocurrency Riot intends to have a hash rate of 7,700 PH/s by the end of 2022. This will be a gradual process, but investors can expect timely updates. Also in today's announcement, Riot Blockchain said it intends to update shareholders on its mining progress monthly. 10 stocks we like better than Riot Blockchain, Inc When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Riot Blockchain, Inc wasn't one of them!

After a weekend in which the lar | 4/12/2021 11:16:24 AM GMT Bitcoin (BTC) is back with a vengeance this weekas a new days trading gets underway with a fresh attack on $60,000. After a weekend in which the largest cryptocurrency avoided a correction, Monday is looking bullish  but what could shape price action in the short term? Cointelegraph presents five factors to keep an eye on for Bitcoin traders as the market inches closer to historic all-time highs. Stocks reflect coronavirus mayhem The macro picture is a tale of two coronavirus moods this week. With the United Kingdom exiting lockdown, sentiment among business leaders has bounced to highs, indicative of pockets of optimism surfacing in the West still battered by coronavirus restrictions. The picture is muddied by eurozonemain players France and Germany, in which the picture is much less rosy, while the United States is also a patchwork of policy when it comes to the virus. As such, stocks are broadly flat as the week begins, while elsewhere, a looming lockdown is sending sentiment plummeting in India, Mondays main downward mover. The controversial measures from Delhi are unnerving markets and no one is sure whether lockdowns will help bring cases under control, Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities told Bloomberg. The incentive to try and bottom-fish at this point is limited for traders. Markets commentator Holger Zschaepitz, meanwhile, described a busy week for equities noting new highs for mainstream risk assets on Friday  something which increasingly includes Bitcoin. Breakout on the cards for Bitcoin The signal of the moment within Bitcoin is finally tied to the spot market. On Monday, $60,000 is back after BTC/USD last passed the significant price level early on Saturday. The weekend saw the largest weekly close in Bitcoins history at around $60,000. BTC/USD 1-week candle chart (Bitstamp). Source: Tradingview At the time of writing, the BTC/USD pair is targeting $61,000 again, less than $1,000 from all-time highs. Among analysts, expectations of Bitcoin reentering uncharted territory are predictably high. Another breakout attempt, on-chain analytics service Skew summarized. A look at order book activity on major exchange Binance shows sellers lined up at $60,500, $61,500 and $62,000 before orders begin to dry up. On the buy side, $59,000, $58,000 and $57,000 remain strong areas of interest. The resulting constriction of volatility, with Bitcoin sandwiched between major buy and sell interest, is a classic signal for the final stages of price consolidation. At 50 days, Bitcoin has now been in such a consolidatory regime since hitting $58,300 for the first time in the last week of February. For popular Twitter trader Crypto Ed, the latest move is surprising, as just last week, more bearish signals filled the low-timeframe landscape. Sunday, in addition, was pointing to an incoming drop. Surprising PA this morning invalidating this idea, he commented. Coinbase punctuates booming on-chain indicators Cointelegraph has often reported on the strength of Bitcoin on-chain indicatorsthis year, these consistently demanding a continuation of the bull market throughout 2021. Despite the past weeks consolidation, nothing has changed for fundamentals, which show that Bitcoin is not yet near the bull cycle peak, for example like that of December 2017. For Twitter account Byzantine General, which produced a comprehensive overview of indicator data this weekend, there is thus no reason to be bearish at $60,000. Summary: - derivs a bit overheated - constant strong spot bid - institutional driven flow - no peak retail euphoria yet - mainstream adoption getting very real - Coinbase IPO could be volatility catalyst, it concluded. Many of those points refer to material already covered by Cointelegraph, while Coinbases upcoming direct listing on Nasdaq (Wednesday) may provide a rare counterpoint narrative this week. Specifically, listing day can often see a sell-off for companies going public, and this Wednesday may therefore see temporary volatility. Coinbase google searches suggest that normies havent caught on yet, Byzantine General added. It seems to be only crypto nerds that are aware and even among us theres disagreement on what this event entails. BTC/USD performance compared to previous cycles. Source: Ecoinometrics/ Twitter Ether sees fresh historic peak in altcoin surge Its not just Bitcoin shooting for the moon on Monday  altcoins are setting records, indicative of a broader leg up for cryptocurrency interest. These are being led by Ether (ETH), the largest altcoinby market cap, which has hit new all-time highs on the day, currently at $2,190. ETH/USD 1-day candle chart (Bitstamp). Source: Tradingview Long tipped to be targeting $5,000 and even $10,000 this cycle, ETH/USDhas gained 7% in the past week, frequently outperforming Bitcoin itself. That performance nonetheless pales in comparison to other major cap altcoins, notably Binance Coin (BNB), which is up 70% in seven days and nearing $600. I think $BNB is headed to $600. Pennant break. All time high break. Price discovery. A lot to like. Looks insane on $BTC pair as well, analyst Scott Melker commented on the action last weekend in a timely prediction As Cointelegraph reported, alt season 2.0 is expected to hit its stride only in summer and reaching hitherto unknown proportions. Fellow analyst Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, believes altcoins time is already here. Coinbase outflows reinforce institutional buy-in narrative Finally, another event that cast the spotlight on Coinbase, this time, involving users rather than the company itself. According to on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, Sunday saw a sudden spike of $750 million in outflows from Coinbases books. While not unequivocally indicative of a major buy-in, such an event would not be unheard of in the current environment, but would be significant in terms of size. Institutional investors continue to both buy and champion Bitcoin as an investment, while rumors swirl of more famous names reportedly eyeing an allocation. Coinbase outflows chart.

188,This Is the Real Danger of the Irrational Exuberance Surrounding Bitcoins,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 10:45:00,"Forget the fact that no government supports this cyber-currency; something much more dangerous lurks behind Bitcoins' astronomical gains. NASDAQ:MSFT ) would top $500 billion in market value. Near their peaks, Cisco traded for around 120 times earnings, while Microsoft was valued at a multiple of 55. It was truly a time of emotional and irrational investing, and Wall Street encouraged it just as much as speculative traders promoted it. This week, I came across an articlefrom the Silicon Valley Business Journal dated March 19, 2000, just nine days after the Nasdaq's all-time record close. In that article, it's stated that 37 investment banks at the time had ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" rating on Cisco without a single ""sell"" or even ""hold"" rating. Furthermore, George Kelly, a Wall Street analyst who was working for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter at the time and was a player in bringing Cisco public in 1990, was quoted as saying in his defense of Cisco's enormous P/E multiple: ""A low P/E usually signals investors are uncomfortable."" Imagine that! Paul Weinstein, a founding partner of Azure Capital Partners and an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston at the time, would make the bold claim that ""Cisco could be the first trillion-dollar market cap company ... within two to three years."" Needless to say, most predictions fizzled out, with Cisco's $557 billion market cap now being worth about $115 billion, Microsoft down to just $241 billion, and the Nasdaq Composite still more than 1,700 points from an all-time high. This week, we witnessed the complete collapse of Bitcoin euphoria as well, with the cyber-currency falling from its $266 peak to as low as $54 as of this writing. What went wrong? What went wrong in both cases is that there wasn't any substance to back up speculators' euphoria, and once everyone realized that nothing more than hope was buoying stocks and Bitcoins, both bubbles began to collapse in epic fashion. The Internet bubble of 2000 wiped out trillions in market value and bankrupted companies that previously had carried market values in the tens of billions. The Bitcoin bubble clearly won't have the same trillion-dollar effect on the economy, but it still could have a notable ripple effect on the pocketbooks of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who've collectively invested about $11 million in Bitcoins. The brothers may have made it a point to avoid investing in something backed by the U.S. dollar, which they see as controlled by politics, but inadvertently chose to throw $11 million into a non-physical currency that pits emotional traders against one another with no tangible price drivers other than greed and hope. History will keep repeating itself The worst part about Bitcoins and the Internet bubble of 2000 is that it will perpetuate the get-rich-quick mentality and ensure that another bout of irrational exuberance and emotional trading will occur in the future A more recent exampleis the debut of social-media powerhouse Facebook ( NASDAQ:FB ) , which tipped the scales with a $100 billion valuation in the secondary markets before its IPO. Investors had placed a valuation of nearly 100 times sales on the company based on the assumption that it would grow into the next Internet powerhouse. The problem, as I described in August shortly after its IPO, is that investors are poor judges of disruptive technologies. It isn't that we can't recognize a great idea when we see one; it's that we assume it'll be a success almost immediately. The same can be said for Bitcoin. It'd be wrong of me to assume it has absolutely no chance of being a viable currency medium over the long run, but speculators' opinions that this is the greatest thing since sliced bread probably has no bearing, either, since there are no tangible price-driving factors that would make the currency move higher outside of greed and hope. And the last time I checked, greed and hope weren't investing strategies -- not even by Gordon Gekko's standardsanymore! (Link opens a YouTube video.) The sad reality is that the Bitcoin bubble will create a new generation of traders that have no real understanding of how the market truly works. Don't get me wrong; the stock market is only as rational and efficient as the investors and brokerages behind those trades. However, the effectiveness of the stock market is a far cry from an emotionally driven, non-tangible, hope- and greed-based cyber-currency that is the Bitcoin.

Cryptocurrency update: BTC spirals, XRP soars & SEC ETF review begins Two major cryptos are gaining traction this week, with Bitcoin and XRP rallying. Elsewhere, the SEC is reviewing a new crypto ETF application that could bring more to the masses. Cryptocurrency update Musk tweet sends BTC spiralling Elon Musk is up to his old Bitcoin tricks. The enigmatic billionaire, and noted crypto champion, tweeted going to moon very soon on Saturday 10 th April, and lo and behold! BTC smashed through the $60,000 level once again. Bitcoin prices hit $61,222 on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitsmap following Musks tweet, reaching above $60,000 for the first time since mid-March 2021. Are all-time highs on the way again? We could be looking at even higher prices this week. At the time of writing, had exceeded Saturdays price, and were trading at around $61,500. Bitcoin prices have doubled in 2021 so far after starting the year around $30,000. Elon Musk has been at the centre of the BTC boom with his itchy tweeting finger and appetite for cryptos. Earlier this year, Tesla made headlines for snapping up $1.5bn worth of BTC. Since then, it has made more profit on BTC price increases than by selling cars. The effect of influential institutional idols like Musk is clear on Bitcoin markets, but its also the power of memes. The internets chief cultural currency has been a strong market force in 2021 (see /r/Wallstreetbets and GameStops tango) and using language like to the moon puts Musk firmly in meme territory. To the moon is something of a rallying cry for a new breed of traders, particularly susceptive to big e-celeb names perceived wisdom. Its not clear if the latest price rally is all down to Musk, or if other factors are at play, but his influence on BTC prices cannot be underestimated. XRP soars after beating legal challenges XRP, the token for blockchain platform Ripple , soared 38% at the tail end of last week, after some key legal wins. The currency has grown 110% in value across the last week as a federal judge ruled that Ripples CEO Brad Garlinghouse and former CEO Chris Larsen do not have to provide their personal financial records to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleges Ripple raised capital via unregistered securities in 2013, to the tune of $1.3bn, but Ripple maintains its token is not a security. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for instance, are not considered securities by the SEC. Presiding United States District Court Judge Sarah Netburn also ruled upon a motion of discovery which grants Ripple access to SEC memos and minutes expressing the agencys interpretation or views. These records are expected to reveal why the SECr has not classed Bitcoin or Ethereum as securities. If the requested documents state the SEC has referred to XRP as a virtual currency, instead of a security, its expected Ripple will be able to strengthen its case. Thats because the lawsuit, brought against Ripple in December 2020, revolves around the SECs determination that XRP is deemed a security. As the case rolls on it looks like a settlement between the two parties is the most likely outcome. As such, investor confidence in XRP and Ripple is going from strength to strength. That is feeding into higher XRP prices that were seeing today. In the seven days up to April 11 th , XRP had made 118% gains  the highest weekly increases seen for three years. SEC WisdomTree Bitcoin ETF review begins Last week, the SEC kicked off its initial review process for WisdomTrees latest Bitcoin ETF application. The body will be reviewing the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, which the ETF giant filed with Cboe BZX Exchange. WisdomTree made its filing last month, following on from a previous attempt to set up a BTC-focused ETF in June 2020. As youll no doubt have seen over the past couple of years, the cryptocurrency sector is still young, brimming with froth and volatility. An ETF, like WisdomTree is proposing, could provide a safer option for retail investors to gain exposure to the sector without having to directly invest in potentially volatile Bitcoin via a regulated financial product. WisdomTrees BTC ETF is the second currently under review by the SEC. The other, by Van Eck, has closed its first comment period, generating only five comments from the securities regulator, which appears promising. While several attempts have been made to get a crypto ETF to market, so far, the SEC has yet to approve any such fund. Over a dozen have been rejected over the last couple of years. However, commentators believe that a BTC ETF will be approved in 2021. That would be a first for the US. Even so, several crypto ETFs have been launched globally on exchanges in Canada and Brazil.

190,Best Digibyte Wallets,usethebitcoin,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 09:16:50,"To select the best Digibyte wallet you should understand your needs. Security, portability and functionality are key factors to choose a DGB wallet. Digibyte (DGB) is a cryptocurrency and blockchain network that focuses on scalability and security. The project was launched back in 2014 and it is one of the oldest alternative virtual currencies in the world. In order to operate, Digibyte works in a similar way to Cardano (ADA). There are three main pillars of the project: Open-Source developers, the DigiByte Foundation and the Awareness Team. Open-source developers work in order to improve the development of the ecosystem and the DGB virtual currency. The DigiByte Foundation works so as to increase research projects and help spread the word about this cryptocurrency. Finally, the Awareness Team deals with the marketing campaigns on social media and other platforms. Users can send and receive DGB funds, and they can also store them. This is why it becomes definitely important to know the best Digibyte wallet. Like with other virtual currencies, transactions are irreversible and the network is fully decentralized. Digibyte works with a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. With it, a network of miners protects the blockchain and process transactions. They earn rewards in DGB for the work they perform. This is similar to how the Bitcoin (BTC) or the Litecoin (LTC) networks work. However, there is a big difference between BTC, LTC and Digibyte mining. ASIC miners are not required in order to be part of the Digibyte network. Users can simply use GPUs in order to get access to the Digibye blockchain. Furthermore, Digibyte is also a blockchain network that allows users to create Digiassets. These are crypto-related and blockchain-based assets that represent digital and physical things. Some examples include documents or financial assets, among other things. Finally, Digibyte is also working on other initiatives such as an authentication system called Digi-ID. Due to these reasons, Digibyte is now among the top 100 largest virtual currencies in the world. What is a Digibyte Wallet? In order to store your DGB virtual currency, you should have a Digibyte wallet. With it, you would not only be able to receive, send and store DGB but you will also be part of the Digibyte community. A Digibyte core wallet is certainly necessary for you to start using DGB. It is a key part of the ecosystem and the first point of contact for users with DGB coins or assets. Moreover, with a Digibyte wallet, you should get access to the features offered by the Digibyte network. Depending on the wallet you use, you would be also able to interact with other blockchain networks. Some wallets offer support not only to Digibyte but also to other digital assets. There are thousands of virtual currencies in the world. Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets There are different types of cryptocurrency wallets Each of them is different and offers a variety of services. However, there are some things we should take into consideration to find the best Digibyte wallet. Custodial and Non-Custodial Wallets The first thing we should know is that there are two types of crypto wallets: custodial and non-custodial. Custodial wallets include exchange wallets and platform wallets. This type of platform that allows you to hold virtual currencies will hold your private keys on your behalf. That means that you would not have control over your funds as with a non-custodial wallet. For example, if there is a hack and the platform where you store your funds gets hacked, then you could eventually lose your DGB coins. This is what happened with the Mt. Gox hack back in 2013/2014. Non-custodial wallets, instead, give you access to your private keys. In this way, you are your own bank. You are the real owner of your funds. Nobody else can get access to them unless they get access to your private keys. Of course, being the owner of your private keys means that you also have to be responsible for them. Thus, you should properly store them and protect them. Hardware and Software Wallets Another distinction that is worth taking into consideration for this Digibyte wallet post is related to whether the wallet is a hardware device or a software program. Hardware Wallets Hardware wallets are devices that keep users private keys outside the internet. They cannot be accessed by anybody else. Only the person that knows the private key is able to handle the coins that have been transferred to the hardware wallet. Several years ago, a Digibyte paper wallet was the favourite method to store private keys offline. In this way, users knew their keys were not available to attackers or hackers. If you want to make sure your funds are safe, a hardware wallet is the best option available right now. Software Wallets A software wallet is also a secure way to store your virtual currencies as long as you hold the private keys. Software wallets include smartphone apps and desktop wallets. Depending on the type of user you are, you might have both or just one. If you enjoy paying and receiving DGB, the best thing you can do is to use a smartphone application. It is light and usually very easy to use. Instead, if you prefer to use a software wallet to also hold other assets, then a desktop wallet might be a better option. Nonetheless, advanced users usually have different wallets. For example, they use a hardware wallet to hold their largest portion of virtual currencies and keep small amounts on software wallets. Best Digibyte Wallets You should already know that there is no killer Digibyte wallet. It might be difficult to find a wallet that would fulfil all your needs. This is due to the fact that wallet providers tend to focus on different features. While some wallets might offer better security standards, others could have enhanced privacy features. For you to know which are the best Digibyte wallets, we have decided to do a list with the most popular ones. Digibyte Core Wallet Digibyte Core wallet is the most popular wallet for DGB holders. It works as a full DigiByte client and it also provides great levels of stability. Two of the main features of this Digibyte wallet include Dandelion and SegWit support. The Digibyte Core Wallet works as a full Digibyte client. With this wallet, you will also download a copy of the blockchain. Thus, this is a wallet for users that really want to hold DGB for the long run and help the network expand. DGB Core Wallet works as a Digibyte desktop wallet. It can be downloaded for Windows, macOS, Linux and RaspberryPi. Coinomi Coinomi wallet is a recognized crypto wallet that provides reliable and stable services for users to receive and send digital currencies. The main characteristic of this Digibyte wallet is related to the large number of assets it supports. Although several wallets are offering multi-currency support, Coinomi has added more than 125 blockchains to its system. Thus, it is compatible with more than 1,770 virtual currencies in the market. This is exactly a great solution for those users that handle a large crypto portfolio and want to keep their funds under control. If you wa",https://usethebitcoin.com/best-digibyte-wallets/

192,"As Bitcoin Becomes Out of Reach, Ethereum Attracting More Eyeballs Now!",dazeinfo,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 07:39:12,"A recent study on most viewed Youtube videos on cryptocurrency depicts few interesting facts. People are interested more in Ethereum now as Bitcoin price Read more From bigwigs such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk discussing cryptoon Twitter to non-fungible token aka NFTscoming into existence, the popularity of digital currencies skyrocketed during the last 12 months. Bitcoin made the most of it and its price peaked to a new height  over $60,000 apiece. With such a massive jump in its price, Bitcoin has become out of reach for most traders and crypto investors. Now, to better understand which cryptocurrencies, other than Bitcoin, are garnering the most amount of consumer attention, a firm called Total Processing analysed the views on crypto-centric videos data on Youtube and discovered some unique insights According to Total Processings data, the smart contract cryptocurrency Ethereum captured the most number of Youtube views in the last 12 months. Ethereum aka ETH related videos, attracted 231 million views on Youtube, after which bitcoin aka BTC came in at the second spot with 199.9 million views. Advertisements Both ETH and BTC combined attracted the lions share of eyeballs on the popular video-sharing platform as they get 4x times more views than Chainlink aka LINK, which reached 45.7 million views since April 2020 and grabbed the 3rd spot. After LINK, the fourth position is being held by Cardano aka ADA, which acquired 43 million views. Total Processing believes that while the mainstream media is definitely a reckoning force and plays a big role in cryptocurrencies, Youtubes role is just as significant. This is quite true as another recent survey reportrevealed how the Google-owned video sharing platform has become U.Ss most popular social media platform in 2021. Behind the crypto coin Cardano (ADA), XRP related videos garnered close to 38.5 million views on Youtube through the year, which is followed by Litecoin aka LTC at 27.5 million views, Uniswap aka UNI at 27.3 million views, Binance coin aka BNB at 25.4 million views, Tether aka USDT at 22.8 million views and Polkadot aka DOT which managed to capture 18.8 million views during the last 12 months. In order to conduct the study, Total Processing looked at the top 10 crypto assets and Processing and scraped the views of a whopping 10,000 videos on Youtube. The firm noted that the channels which actively discuss cryptocurrencies saw a considerable amount of success in 12 months and also impacted the price of the coins. For instance, the channel JRNY Cryptopublished a video wherein he explained which altcoins he would buy and that in turn led the price of stormx to increaseby a whopping 189.68% in seven days. Advertisements All in all, it is well understood that the conversation surrounding cryptocurrencies has expanded far beyond only Bitcoin. All thanks to crypto enthusiasts who are spreading the word about it on platforms such as Youtube, where everyone, including both amateur and serious investors, can freely consume their content. As Bitcoin trading price is constantly going up and showing no sign of another crash, especially after the recent investment of $1.5 billion by Tesla, people are visualising a promising future of the cryptocurrency market and actively turning towards other cryptocurrencies, such as Etherium, which are still in reach.

193,Best BCH Wallet (Bitcoin Cash),usethebitcoin,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 07:33:07,"Finding the best BCH wallet is not an easy task. You should consider fees, interface, interoperability, multi-currency support and other things. Coinomi What is Bitcoin Cash (BCH)? Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world. Thats a fact. At the time of writing, it is the 14th largest with a market valuation of over $10 billion. Bitcoin Cash was created as a hard fork of the Bitcoin (BTC) network back in 2017. The main reason behind this fork was related to the way in which the Bitcoin community planned to scale the Bitcoin blockchain. The BTC community preferred to scale with off-chain solutions such as the Lightning Network (LN), while the BCH community wanted to increase the Bitcoin block size. Considering both of these communities couldnt reach an agreement, BCH split from BTC and created its own chain with larger blocks than the traditional 1 MB Bitcoin blocks. Nowadays, both digital assets are accepted in different exchanges and platforms. In this way, investors can get access to two different blockchain networks that have a lot in common. It is worth taking into consideration that due to the increased block size, BCH transfers are faster and cheaper than on the Bitcoin network. That being said, if you are using BCH, then you want to use the best BCH wallet. You want to make sure that you have a safe and useful Bitcoin Cash wallet. There are several wallets. This guide will be very helpful for you to know which are the most popular ones. What is a Cryptocurrency Wallet? A cryptocurrency wallet is a hardware device or software application that helps users hold their virtual currencies. There are different types of wallets in the market and each of them offers different services. Depending on your needs you can use a safer wallet or a more easy-to-use application. This is why it is so important to understand the role wallets play when handling digital assets. For example, the first thing we need to take into consideration is related to whether this is a non-custodial or custodial wallet. Custodial and Non-Custodial Wallets Custodial wallets are those in which there is a third party holding your private keys. In this case, you are not the real owner of your funds. Why? Because if there is a hack to the platform holding your private keys, you could end up losing your coins. Moreover, when you have a custodian taking care of your private keys, you are giving consent they can do whatever they want with your funds. There is no difference between a bank account where you hold your fiat currencies from a custodial wallet. There is a centralized authority that can freeze your account and decide whether you use or not your coins. With a non-custodial BCH wallet, things are different. If you hold your private keys you are the real owner of your funds. There are no other parties taking care of your money. This is certainly one of the most important things in the crypto market. If we learned something during the last years is that we should be responsible for the private keys of our wallet. However, this comes with several responsibilities. If you want to be the owner of your Bitcoin Cash, you should protect your private keys. What is BCH Wallet? A BCH wallet offers users the possibility to store Bitcoin Cash. There are several cryptocurrency wallets in the market. Some of them do not support Bitcoin Cash, while others do. Understanding which are the wallets that support BCH would give you a clear idea of the solutions you can choose from to protect your funds or use them on a regular basis. In general, there are no differences between a BCH wallet compared to other wallets. The only thing you should take into consideration is the fact that to a BCH wallet address you can send BCH and no other virtual currency. If you send other digital assets to your BCH wallet, then you could never see these funds again. Each of the wallets in the market has different implementations and work in different ways. Knowing this would reduce unwanted money losses or errors. BCH Paper Wallet Another thing you should take into consideration is that if you want to store your BCH offline, there are two ways of doing so. One of the ways and the easiest one is by using a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are the safest solutions in the market to store digital assets. However, these wallets are paid and expensive, especially for users that want to store small amounts of money or for short periods of time. This is where a BCH paper wallet could help you store your BCH offline. These wallets are literally papers where you have a public and a private address. The public address would help you deposit funds there. The private address would represent your private keys that you would use to sign transactions (get access to your funds). These wallets are very fragile. They can get lost in an easy way. The private keys could also be damaged (this is just paper). Thus, their durability might not be ideal for long-term holders. Best BCH Wallets Available Right Now There are dozens of BCH wallets right now in the cryptocurrency market. As we mentioned before, each of them is different and would offer you different services. Some wallets have a crypto exchange integrated into their systems, while others focus on privacy. The best BCH wallet would depend on your needs. This is just a list of the most popular BCH wallets available. However, there are many others. Ledger Wallet Ledger is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets all over the world. This is a hardware wallet and can be purchased for as low as 60 (Ledger Nano S). If you want to know your BCH coins are protected at all times and cannot be accessed by hackers, then this is the right wallet for you. Ledger wallet focuses on security. This is the most secure wallet you can find right now if you want to hold digital assets for long periods of time. Indeed, this is the favourite wallet selected by long-term holders. At the same time, if you buy a Ledger Wallet, you would not only have access to Bitcoin Cash but also to most of the largest digital assets in the world. Finally, there are some new implementations that show Ledger wants to expand its services. For example, you can already buy more digital assets (or sell them) directly from this wallet. Atomic Wallet Atomic wallet is a desktop and smartphone wallet that offers support to more than 300 different cryptocurrencies. The wallet is now being used by over 1 million users worldwide and it includes virtual currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and of course, Bitcoin Cash (BCH). This wallet focuses on three main things: security, anonymity and customer support. In terms of security, users will have their private keys encrypted. They will never leave the device. Users are in control of their funds at all times. If you want to start using this wallet, you do not need an account, verification of KYC. This is certainly important considering the cryptocurrency market has been moving towards very strict KYC regulations. Finally, in terms of support, the team behind Atomic Wallet is always ready to help users handle their questio",https://usethebitcoin.com/best-bch-wallet/
194,Bitcoin (BTC) Reaches Highest-Ever Weekly Close,yahoo,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 07:21:00,"BTC is expected to break out above the current horizontal resistance area and reach a new all-time high price. Highest-ever weekly close BTC increased... The most sophisticated market players have taken steps to hedge their portfolios by investing is these silent, yet soaring market sectors.... Reuters Bitcoin hits record high before landmark Coinbase IPO LONDON (Reuters) -Bitcoin hit a record of $62,741 on Tuesday, extending its 2021 rally to new heights a day ahead of Coinbase's initial public offering.  The largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange's listing on the Nasdaq on Wednesday is considered a landmark victory for cryptocurrency advocates.  The world's biggest cryptocurrency, which has growing mainstream acceptance as an investment and a means of payment, rose as much as 5% on Tuesday. 1h ago Oil prices tick up after robust China data Oil prices ticked up on Tuesday after strong Chinese import data but markets broadly shrugged off Middle East tensions which have so far not disrupted oil supply.  Brent crude oil futures were up 25 cents, or 0.4%, at $63.53 a barrel by 0855 GMT while U.S. crude oil futures gained 14 cents, or 0.2%, to $59.84 a barrel.  China's exports grew at a robust pace in March in yet another boost to the nation's economic recovery as global demand picks up amid progress in worldwide COVID-19 vaccinations, while import growth surged to the highest in four years. 8h ago Investors Dump Commodities as Supercycle Call Meets Skepticism (Bloomberg) -- Net bullish wagers on rising commodity prices fell to the lowest since December last week, raising questions about the commodity supercycle.Money managers are trimming what had been the largest wager for rising commodity prices in at least a decade as stumbling economic reopening efforts force a reconsideration of the popular recovery trade. A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.Theres a sense that we have yet to get rid of the coronavirus, with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint, said Ole Hansen, head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. The surge in Treasury yields, a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.Hedge funds net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row, according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011, while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar, thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated, hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile, the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week, investor outflows were most pronounced for oil, with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July, while further out, the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure, volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent widespread deleveraging after global benchmark Brent futures briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March, Ryan Fitzmaurice, commodities strategist at Rabobank, said in a note Friday.Now, a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider. The cost of shipping unpacked commodities like grains and iron ore, known as dry bulk, is up more than 50% this year.The move up in shipping costs makes it more expensive to move things around, which goes contrary to the idea of a supercycle, Eddie Tofpik, head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at ADM Investor Services International Ltd., said at an online event last month.Still, calls remain for commodities to continue their price rebound this year after this period of consolidation.Commodities remain the best performing asset class of 2021, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a report Friday. We view this consolidation as nothing more than a fleeting speed bump created by logistical bottlenecks in vaccine roll-outs.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 14h ago",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-btc-reaches-highest-ever-072100430.html
195,Better Buy: Bitcoin Investment Trust vs. Bitcoin (BTC),fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 07:07:00,"Which is the better way to add the leading cryptocurrency to your portfolio? Earnings: 2 Cloud Stocks to Watch This Month In fact, the closest thing to a bitcoin ETF in the market is the Bitcoin Investment Trust. It's a company (not an ETF) that owns bitcoins, and shares of the company are traded on the public market. In other words, the shareholders of the Bitcoin Investment Trust effectively own the company's bitcoins, as they make up virtually all of its assets. There are two main downsides to investing in the Bitcoin Investment Trust as opposed to simply buying bitcoin directly. First is the ongoing management fee. The Greyscale Investment Trust, which operates the Bitcoin Investment Trust, charges a 2% annual management fee. This is high by anyone's mutual fund or ETF standards and means that investors will slowly ""own"" fewer bitcoins over time. Second, and even more significantly, shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust trade at a huge premium to the value of the bitcoins they represent. As of the latest available information, each share of the company represents ownership of 0.00099063 bitcoin. While the price of bitcoin (and the Bitcoin Investment Trust) obviously fluctuates over time, here's how the math works out at the exact moment I'm writing this: The Bitcoin Investment Trust trades for $4.20 per share. Bitcoin tokens trade for $3,588. Multiplying by the factor in the last paragraph shows an asset value for the Bitcoin Investment Trust of approximately $3.55. So, shares trade at a hefty 18% premium over the value of bitcoin they represent. The verdict To be clear, I'm not a big fan of cryptocurrencies as an investment vehicle. The industry is simply too young, and I'd compare investing in a particular cryptocurrency to investing in a tech start-up in the late 1990s -- sure, there's a chance that some of them will make it, but the vast majority of cryptocurrencies on the market are likely heading to zero. And don't think that bitcoin will automatically come out on top because of its first-mover advantage and the fact that it's the largest one. It certainly has a better chance of success than most, but it's far from a sure thing.

196,Bitcoin and Altcoins are both in good health,fxstreet,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 05:49:29,"The big cryptocurrencies are holding steady, while many altcoins have ripped to new highs. Bitcoin (BTC, Tech/Adoption Grade A-) is pretty much righ | 4/12/2021 5:49:29 AM GMT The big cryptocurrencies are holding steady, while many altcoins have ripped to new highs. Bitcoin (BTC, Tech/Adoption Grade A-) is pretty much right to the level where it started the week, indicating mostly sideways trading for the King of Crypto this week. 0x (ZRX), new to coverage in this space, is up more than 20% today and an eye-popping 550% so far in 2021. Action in the Weiss Crypto Indexes this week absolutely reflects altseason. Bitcoin has essentially been trading sideways since mid-March after peaking north of $61,000. And you know what? This recent action is actually healthy for both Bitcoin and the rest of the market. For Bitcoin, whats happening is good because its building back some buy-side pressure, consolidating and establishing a steady base for its next large move in what is a continuously improving macro context. Its good for the crypto market at large because when Bitcoin trades sideways like this, it simply exposes altcoins to more investors. Thats why we call it altseason. Still, BTC is still trading north of $58,000 today, a solid level on which its building for a fresh breakout. Thats what happened with the previous all-time high set in February. For now, the King is fine as long as it trades above $55,000. A drop below that level, meanwhile, should be construed as a buying opportunity ahead of the next bull run. Heres BTC in U.S. dollar terms via Coinbase: We havent covered 0x here, but its high time we did, as its up more than 20% today. 0x is a decentralized exchange protocol that allows developers to create their own decentralized exchanges (DEXs). ZRX is close to setting a new all-time high; its previous high was set in early 2018, somewhere between $2.50 and $2.75. ZRX has had an absolutely outstanding year: Kicking off 2021 around $0.35, its risen more than 550% all the way to $2.27 today. Thats much too big of a run to ignore. The fact that some of the popular coins from the 2017-18 bull market look like theyre getting ready to push to new all-time highs is yet another good sign for altseason. ZRX will likely face some resistance between current levels and the $2.50 mark and will be in uncharted waters if/when it breaks above $2.75. Heres ZRX in U.S. dollar terms via Coinbase: Index roundup Most of the crypto market advanced this week but Bitcoin underperformed. While Bitcoin traded sideways, it still didnt lose much ground compared to last week, which is a good sign when the rest of the market is taking off. Bitcoin usually isnt setting the pace during altcoinseason, but it often holds its value the best during correctional periods of volatility. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH, Tech/Adoption Grade A-) managed to cross the symbolic $2,000 price level and hit a new all-time high, which is very bullish even as investors look for outsized returns in smaller altcoins. The Weiss 50 Crypto Index (W50) gained 9.18% this week as the crypto market continues its rally. The Weiss 50 Ex-BTC Index (W50X) increased 19.05%, showing the King of Crypto was lapped by the broader market in comparison. Breaking down this weeks performance by market capitalization, we see that smaller and mid-sized altcoins vastly outpaced the most established names. The Weiss Large-Cap Crypto Index (WLC) rose 13.76%, as other big names excluding Bitcoin managed to advance. Mid-cap cryptocurrencies shot up this week, but they still trailed behind the small-caps. The Weiss Mid-Cap Crypto Index (WMC) climbed 29.82%. The small-caps were the biggest winners again, with the Weiss Small-Cap Crypto Index (WSC) skyrocketing 48.24% higher. This weeks crypto market performance was strong, and it was no surprise to see smaller and mid-sized altcoins set the pace again. As altseason progresses, well continue seeing massive jumps from projects because of increasing hype and adoption. Another big reason these smaller assets tend to outperform is the fact that theyre purchased using pairs of the most established cryptocurrencies, which puts downward pressure on the biggest names. Its a positive sign that Bitcoin and Ethereumare still appreciating, or holding their value, as it shows they remain in high demand. Growing institutional adoption and recognition of the crypto markets utility should continue to drive the long-term bullish trend even through periods of higher volatility. Notable News, Notes and Tweets Altseason? Grayscale Investments will eventually convert flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund. Bloomberg seems to be changing its Bitcoin tune. Whats next Were fixated on the ongoing altseason. And as evidenced by todays charts and this weeks, for that matter  we have good reason to be bullish on the alternatives to Bitcoin. Thats not to say Bitcoin has been performing poorly; its just the King has been outgained by many altcoins recently  hence altcoin season. As we noted in the Index Roundup, the W50X (thats the Weiss Crypto 50 Ex-BTC) performed better than the index including Bitcoin, as many blue-chip altcoins shone this week. Also, the small-caps outperformed the mid-caps, which, in turn, beat the large-caps. The market is rewarding speculative bets right now. This is exactly the type of price action were accustomed to seeing during altseason. This one is not disappointing.

197,Bitcoin Struggles Near $60K; Short-Term Support Around $58K,nasdaq,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 00:00:00,"Over the weekend, bitcoin (BTC) tested resistance around $61,000 twice before sellers gained control. Bitcoins struggle near its all-time high has been a consistent theme since February as the uptrend consolidates. Initial support is around $58,000 on the four-hour chart. BTC held support around $50,000 on March 25 after retracing nearly 50% of its rally from the February 28 price low. Since then, BTCs near 19% rally has stabilized, breaking above a series of lower price highs from April 1 and holding support from the 200-period moving average. The cryptocurrency is now overbought, defined by its relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart. Previous overbought signals have preceded 5%-10% declines over the past month and have all occurred near $58,000-$60,000 resistance areas. A decisive break above $60,000 is needed to reignite the broader uptrend. For now, short-term buyers remain active at higher support levels since February.

198,7 Cryptocurrencies That Are Leading The Market Higher in 2021,marketbeat,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 00:00:00,"The cryptocurrency market is worth upwards of $1 trillion and growing, and most of that value is centered in the top seven. View the Cryptocurrencies Now 7 Cryptocurrencies That Are Leading The Market Higher in 2021 Share Posted on Monday, January 11th, 2021 by MarketBeat Staff An Influx Of Capital Is Driving Cryptocurrency Higher There is an influx of money to the cryptocurrency market that is driving the entire complex higher. Not only is institutional interest peaking but recognition and use are on the rise as well. With Bitcoin setting new all-time highs 100% above the 2017 highs the number of new Bitcoin millionaires is on the rise too. But Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency on the market today by far. The number of cryptocurrencies on the market has been growing steadily with more than 4,000 listed on Coinmarketcap alone. But that doesnt mean they are all worth your time. Many if not most will not stand the test of time. One way to judge the markets interest in a cryptocurrency is its market performance gains. A cryptocurrency that is gaining in value is certainly one that you may want to own. The better method of judging the markets interest in a cryptocurrency is the market cap. The cryptocurrency market is worth upwards of $1 trillion and growing, and most of that value is centered in the top seven. Together, the bottom 3,993 odd cryptocurrencies only account for 12% of the market and have yet to prove any lasting value. #1 - Bitcoin BTC ) is the leading cryptocurrency by a very wide margin. The coins dominance, or its percent of the total cryptocurrency market cap, has been running near 70% over the last few months and is on the rise. One reason is Bitcoins simplicity, it is the easiest by far to use, and the fact it has been around the longest. In a sense, Bitcoin is the gateway to cryptocurrency for many users because BTC wallets and exchanges are ubiquitous and many of the lesser-known coins and crypto-applications can only be purchased with BTC or some other cryptocurrency. The drawbacks of Bitcoin are many but the main two are the cost of mining and the speed of the network. In terms of cost, Bitcoin is a power hog consuming more than 140 million terahertz of computing power every second of the day. In terms of transaction speed, the Bitcoin network processes about 5 transactions per second compared to the near-limitless amount of transactions per second handled by Visa and Mastercard #2 - Ethereum ETH ) is the second biggest cryptocurrency market by market cap and growing. To help put the market into perspective and how important Bitcoin is to the overall picture understand that 2nd place Ethereum is only 13% of the total market. Thats a big difference from first to second. The difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is the use-case. Bitcoin has only one purpose, to provide a means of exchanging value across the Internet. Ethereum is meant to function as a sort of blockchain-based computer. You can use the ETH tokens as an exchange of value but the real value lay in smart-contracts. Smart-contracts elevate block-chain to a new level where complex financial transactions can take place and that is the foundation of defi or decentralized finance. Staking, derivatives, insurance, lending, and interest-bearing savings accounts are only a few of the defi applications that are being built on top of the ETH network. Deposits into defi accounts surged in the first week of January 2021 rising more than 33% in that time. At last count, there was more than $22.5 billion of value locked into defi and this figure is growing daily. #3 - Tether USDT ) is the 3rd most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap with a circulating value of just over $23.5 billion. Tether, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, is a stable coin whose value is pegged to the dollar. The value of the dollar may rise and fall versus BTC, ETH, or some other fiat currency but Tether dollars will always be worth $1.00. The Tether network is run by Tether Limited that issued coins, supposedly, on a 1-to-1 basis with deposited dollars. Tether is a very controversial cryptocurrency because, in reality, it is not backed 1:1 by the dollar but by a combination of dollars and other securities. Tether is also central to a theory that Bitcoins 2017 price-spike is due to market manipulation involving the Bitfinex exchange. Proponents of the theory claim Bitfinex and Tether Limited issued un-secured Tether dollars and used them to artificially prop up the price of BTC. Regardless of all this, Tether trades $1:$1 with the dollar. #4 - XRP XRP ) is the native token of the Ripple network and a cryptocurrency that came under a lot of pressure at the end of 2020. Ripple is a cross-border platform that facilitates banking transactions in a decentralized manner. The network functions on the XRP token but Ripples founders say they have no control of it. In late December 2020, the SEC charged Ripple Laboratories and two of the companys execs for selling securities without a license. The charges are the end result of a much larger scandal alleging that Ripple Laboratories has been creating an unlimited number of coins out of thin air and selling them for profit. In the lawsuit, the SEC claimed that XRP was a security instead of a commodity (like Bitcoin) because it was generated and distributed by Ripple Labs in a centralized fashion and was not being adopted by financial institutions for its advertised use cases. The SEC alleges Ripple executives sold 14.6 billion units of XRP for more than $1.38 billion to fund the companys operations and enrich themselves. #5 - Litecoin Hardfork is a word every cryptocurrency investor needs to be aware of. A hard fork is when a blockchain splits into two new blockchains. Hard forks are not very common, and one coin tends to win out over the other, but there are some success stories. One of them is Litecoin ( LTC ). Litecoin is based on an original and very early version of Bitcoin (Bitcoin has seen some upgrades over the years) and aims to be a faster, lighter version of the original. Litecoin holds the #5 position in terms of market cap with nearly $12 billion in total value. Among Litecoins advantages is the speed at which blocks are created. Litecoin is able to process transactions at a quicker rate because it creates a new block every 2.5 minutes compared to Bitcoins target of 10 minutes. Among Litecoins disadvantages is its use of memory-intensive algorithms that make it both more complicated and more expensive to run. Litecoin was among the very first blockchain networks to adopt the Segregated Witness or SegWit protocol. SegWit effectively splits each block in two, the ID portion and the data portion, allowing better security as well as enhanced network speed. #6 - Bitcoin Cash BCH ) was not. Bitcoin Cash was born from a rift in the Bitcoin mining community that resulted in a split and the creation of new money. The rift centered on how to update Bitcoin to accommodate the growing number of transactions. The ultimate solution was SegWit but some in the community felt the move would take Bitcoin down a path that was never intended by its creators.

Weekly Crypto Price Prediction: More upside to be seen next week BTC/USD Bitcoin saw a good amount of volatility last week as the market first moved lower to the $55,500 price mark, where support was found on Wednesday. Over the following days, the crypto price action reversed and steadily pushed higher until a sharp spike higher on Saturday. Resistance was found around $61,000, sending BTC /USD into a consolidation around the $60,000 previous resistance level. Overnight another attempt to push higher was made However, the $61,000 resistance prevented a further upside again. Therefore, the crypto price action is still not ready to move higher, and further consolidation is needed to build a base from which to push higher. If the bullish price momentum continues, we should see Bitcoin break higher this week and finally set a new all-time high above the $62,000 price mark. From there, no further price resistance is seen until semi-round number resistance at $65,000.",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/weekly-crypto-price-analysis-2021-04-12/

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.

The negatives can, however, be prevented if Bitcoin demand can increase progressively.

216,Bitcoin Acceptance At Online Casinos Continues To Grow,usethebitcoin,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 13:04:47,"Bitcoin (BTC) acceptance at online casinos and gambling sites has been growing over the last years. However, the last months have been definitely positive for Reddit Bitcoin (BTC) acceptance at online casinos and gambling sites has been growing over the last years. However, the last months have been definitely positive for the whole crypto industry, including online casinos. There are some reasons related to the expansion of this market. Not only the growth of digital assets has been a catalyst but also the benefits related to using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to gamble online. Benefits of Bitcoin Online Casinos Bitcoin is a decentralized digital asset that brings benefits to different industries, including the online casino one. There are several benefits of Bitcoin online casinos that users value. If we want to understand how Bitcoin casinos work, then we also need to know which are the main benefits of this fast-growing digital asset. In order to get the best information about casino platforms in the United Kingdom (UK) users can rely on . In this way, individuals that want to get access to some of the best casinos in the market can easily do so through this page. Faster Transaction Times and Cheaper Fees Two of the main benefits of Bitcoin online casinos include low transaction costs and fast transaction times. Bitcoin works without relying on a centralized authority and it can be sent throughout borders in just a few minutes and for just a few cents. In this way, users forget about using their bank accounts (wire transfers) or credit card purchases that can take several hours or even days to be credited. Thus, Bitcoin makes it faster and cheaper for users to get access to their favourite online casinos. Data Protection Another benefit is related to the anonymity that Bitcoin gives to users. Although Bitcoin is not anonymous, it is certainly more secure and private than traditional payment methods. When you share your credit card details, this information could be hacked and used by criminals. Moreover, sharing personal data such as addresses, name and surname or bank branch might not be a good idea. The information stored in servers could be hacked and malicious parties could have access to it. With Bitcoin, you do not need to be worried about it. You just send the funds to the Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) address shared by the casino platform. In just a few minutes the transfer will be processed and everything without sharing any private data. Exclusive Bonuses and Offers Finally, several Bitcoin casinos have special offers for users that deposit cryptocurrencies. Although there are also bonuses and promotions for fiat deposits, promotions are usually more attractive for users that handle digital assets. You can compare Bitcoin casinos using Sister Sites in order to understand which is the casino that offers the best solutions. Conclusion Although Bitcoin has been expanding in the market and people want to get access to it at all costs, BTC has real use cases for the casino industry. The whole gambling market has been adding support to BTC and other virtual currencies in order to make it easier, faster, cheaper and more secure for users to get access to the latest online gambling games.",https://usethebitcoin.com/bitcoin-acceptance-at-online-casinos-continues-to-grow/

On the other hand, volumes in South Africa, which occupied second place in 2020, dropped marginally. Consequently, South Africa has now been relegated to the fourth position the data shows. Contrasting Regulatory Regimes Meanwhile, one reporthas attributed the surge in Kenya and Ghanas P2P volumes to the two countries tacit endorsement of cryptocurrencies. For instance, the report points to the Central Bank of Ghanas launch of a regulatory sandbox that prioritized blockchain-based companies including cryptocurrency startups as one factor that may have boosted the countrys volumes. This is in contrast to the situation in South Africa where regulator warningsabout cryptocurrency use and investment increased following the collapse of Mirror Trading International, the biggestscam bitcoin in 2020, according to Chainalysis. As explained in the report, crypto dealings in South Africa have come under increased scrutiny, with tougher regulations including mandatory licenses and taxes triggering investor exits. The report also adds that bitcoin trading in South Africa has effectively lost its autonomy and this has reduced its market appeal to investors. Nigeria P2P Volumes Surge After Central Bank Directive In the meantime, the data shows that P2P volumes in Nigeria seem to have been boosted by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)s directiveagainst crypto entities that was issued on February 6. As the Tulip datashows, Nigerias P2P bitcoin traded volumes in the past 90 days surged to nearly $100 million. The figure, which is nearly two and half times more than that of second-placed Kenya, suggests more bitcoin users are now using P2P platforms. Meanwhile, the data appears shows that P2P traded volumes in many other African countries surged after March 2020, when lockdown measures took hold. Since then, many countries on the continent have seen their P2P bitcoin traded volumes grow steadily. What are your thoughts on the rising P2P BTCtraded volumes in Kenya and Ghana?

Their numbers have therefore also hit an 11-month peak as explained by the team at Santiment through the following statementand accompanying chart. The percentage of s supply held by whale addresses with 100k or more $BTC has risen from 0.76% 11 weeks ago, to 2.20% today, an 11-month high. Meanwhile, the smaller 1k-100k $BTC addresses have dropped from 42.4% to 39.5% in the same 11 weeks. Fear and FUD Had Increased When Bitcoin Failed to Break $60k In an April 7th analysis the team at Santiment had pointed out that there was an increased level of fear and negative sentiment in the crypto market. The fear and FUD in the crypto markets were attributed to Bitcoin failing to recapture the $60k price level and Ethereum falling back below $2k. Bitcoin would go on to regain $60k albeit temporarily, with Ethereum now trading at $2,147. Such fear and uncertainty could be one reason the number of Bitcoin holders with 1k to 100k BTC has droppedas highlighted above. High Chance of Volatility During Bitcoins Weekly Close With respect to price, Bitcoin is once again trading below $60k at its current value of $59,800. The weekly close is only a few hours away with Bitcoin once again facing a possible dip to $58k. If this macro support zone is broken during the event, Bitcoin could revisit the $56k price area before bullishness can resume with the new week.

220,Bitcoin's History of Crushing Speculators,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 10:45:00,"Beware before you get into the buying frenzy. , and Central Fund of Canada ( NYSEMKT:CEF ) are due in part to Bitcoin's taking over their traditional role as safe-haven assets in light of banking-system uncertainty in Europe. But before you jump into the Bitcoin market yourself, you need to understand just how volatile that market is. Even though Bitcoin hasn't been around all that long, its history is still long enough to have included a cycle of speculative frenzy followed by a bursting bubble that created big losses for those who bought into the hype. Turning the clock back Back in 2011, Bitcoin had a similar upsurgein popularity in response to a massive price move. In the span of a single year, prices for the digital currency rose from $0.003 to $10, a 300,000% increase that evoked massive interest from performance-following investors. As proponents pointed to the virtues of Bitcoin in comparison to the central-bank-influenced traditional currency markets, rising prices seemed to validate the Bitcoin model. Eventually, Bitcoin prices reached $30. But in the span of just a few short months, Bitcoin lost 90% of those gains plunging back to the $2 to $3 level. As Fool contributor Mike Pienciak noted at the time, even lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen cautioned would-be investors about the cybercurrency's volatility: Bitcoin will get mentioned someplace with lots of readers, a bunch of those readers will like the idea and try to buy Bitcoins, their price will rise which will draw even more people to ""invest,"" which will drive the price up even more ... until people decide that the price isn't going to rise any more and everybody rushes to sell before the price drops. I predict there will be between one and five Bitcoin bubbles (price will double or more and then crash back down below the starting price) in the next four years. At this point, Andresen's prediction has only come half-true. But as previous bubbles in other assets have shown, an influx of desperate buyers can only go so far before demand evaporates, causing prices to crash. Will Bitcoin succeed or fail? Proponents of Bitcoin will rightly point out that over time, the prevailing trend of the cybercurrency's price has been upward. Even looking back to before the latest speculative fever took over, Bitcoin's price in the $10 to $15 range marked a major recovery from its 2011 losses. Even if prices crash, they may not erase all of Bitcoin's long-term gains. Bitcoin's long-term success, however, will have little comfort for those who've paid $100 to $150 or more for Bitcoin in recent days.

223,"What's Wrong With Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin?",fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 08:24:00,"Bitcoin's chief rivals are leading the crypto market lower, and two factors are to blame. Mar 21, 2018 at 9:24AM Author Bio A Fool since 2010, and a graduate from UC San Diego with a B.A. in Economics, Sean specializes in the healthcare sector and investment planning. You'll often find him writing about Obamacare, marijuana, drug and device development, Social Security, taxes, retirement issues and general macroeconomic topics of interest. Follow @TMFUltraLong Investors who had the nerve and wherewithal to invest in cryptocurrencies early in 2017 and hold throughout the year were probably handsomely rewarded. Between the beginning and end of 2017, the aggregate cryptocurrency market cap gained almost $600 billion, which works out to an increase in value of more than 3,300%. For a single asset class, it might just be the greatest 12-month return we will see in our lifetimes. Unfortunately, 2018 hasn't looked anything like the previous record-shattering year. After hitting an all-time market cap high of $835 billion on Jan. 7, cryptocurrencies pushed to lows that hadn't been seen since around Thanksgiving on March 17 ($274 billion). But it's not the drop itself that's necessarily the most attention-grabbing point. Instead, it's what's leading the crypto market cap significantly lower. Image source: Getty Images. Don't blame bitcoin for this recent decline Most folks would probably assume bitcoin is to blame. After all, bitcoin is the largest virtual coin by market cap, and frankly it's the only one most of the public has probably heard about. While bitcoin has indeed performed poorly, it's not been the driving force behind the recent collapse in crypto prices. That credit belongs to everything not named bitcoin. You see, the fourth quarter of the previous year absolutely belonged to cryptocurrencies not named bitcoin. Having seen bitcoin tokens explode from less than $0.01 to $10,000 per token in under eight years had speculators throwing darts at dozens of virtual currencies in 2017, grasping for straws at what might be ""the next bitcoin."" As a result, many of bitcoin's chief rivals ran circles around it last year Ethereum, which is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, increased in value by 9,383% in 2017, while Ripple and Litecoin, two other extremely popular digital currencies, surged by 35,564% and 5,260%, respectively. Meanwhile, bitcoin rose 1,364%. This year has seen a complete reversal of the fourth-quarter 2017 trend. After hitting a high of $1,432 per Ether token on Jan. 13, Ethereum has pushed as low as $460, representing a loss in value of 68%. Ripple, which was unstoppable last year and hit an all-time high of $3.84 per XRP token on Jan. 3, has since seen its coin trade as low as $0.55 -- a decline of 86%. Even Litecoin, which in some circles is viewed as bitcoin's biggest rival, has plummeted from a peak of $375 on Dec. 19 to as low as $107 in early February. Comparatively, bitcoin, which made up as little as 33% of the aggregate cryptocurrency market cap in mid-January, now comprises 44.4% of the crypto market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.com. That's close to a three-month high. In short, even though bitcoin is falling, it's dropping far less than its peers. Image source: Getty Images. Two likely reasons bitcoin's biggest peers are plunging That prompts the question: What the heck is wrong with Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin? Taking a broader look at bitcoin's biggest rivals, two factors stand out as being responsible for their considerable declines in recent months. 1. A low barrier to entry First, there's the simple fact that competition within the digital currency and blockchain space has exploded. Blockchain is the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger often underpinning cryptocurrencies that's responsible for recording all transactions without the need for a financial intermediary, like a bank. Last summer, there were around 900 virtual currencies that investors could buy. As of March 17, there were more than 1,650 with nearly all of them accompanied by their very own proprietary blockchain technology. Were this not competition enough, brand-name companies have been working on developing their own blockchain technologies, some of which work independently of a virtual currency. For example, IBM ( NYSE:IBM ) is developing blockchain solutions for the financial services industry, as well as non-currency applications. In October 2017, IBM partnered with Stellar to use its Lumens coin as a financial intermediary in cross-border transactions in the South Pacific region processed on IBM's blockchain platform. Also, IBM and shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk recently announced their intention to create a separate joint venturethat'll focus on developing shipping-based blockchain solutions. Such solutions could allow for real-time tracking of shipped products, as well as expedite approvals by eliminating paper from the equation. In other words, growing competition from other cryptocurrencies and brand-name companies as a result of the low barrier to entry in developing and deploying blockchain and virtual coins is making life difficult. Image source: Getty Images. 2. The proof-of-concept conundrum The other issue appears to be the proof-of-concept Catch-22that practically every cryptocurrency is currently stuck in. On the surface, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin have done a really good job of brandling their blockchain technology or tokens, and the result has been countless partnerships. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance had 200 member organizations as of October testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain across a variety of industries. Meanwhile, Ripple landed five brand-name financial partnersin under two years' time, and Litecoin's average daily transactions have been steadily climbing since founder Charlie Lee announced he'd be working full-time to further Litecoin as a medium of exchange for goods and services. But the underlying problem for most cryptocurrencies is that their platforms are being tested in small-scale projects and demos and not in large-scale, real-world scenarios. Enterprises simply don't feel comfortable yet with the idea of switching to blockchain platforms because they haven't been proven on a large scale. Yet, they'll never be proven on a large scale until a handful of enterprises gives blockchain a chance. This Catch-22 is precisely why cryptocurrency valuations have been deflating. If businesses don't move beyond this proof-of-concept conundrum, it's possible we could see Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin fall further, despite each offering unique advantages over bitcoin.

Learn more https://t.co/UQ3ixoaWzE  Algorand (@Algorand) April 10, 2021 In a bid to hand out grants for innovative projects, Algorand Foundation has invested in Swingby. It is a strategic move to help bring Skybridge tech to the Algorand chain. As such, both companies will work together and make use of Skybridge to expand the Algorand ecosystem. This would mean that they plan to build bridges to Ethereum and Bitcoin from the platform. To clarify, Swingby will launch a BTC to Algorand bridge as well as one from Ethereum to Algorand. Using this, the latter will also let existing ERC20 tokens travel easily from one chain to the other. After the launch, liquidity providers existing on Algorand will be combined with the bridges via Skypools. Additionally, they will release the three updates in a step-by-step process. In this way, the companies seek to mark separate milestones. Further, the updates will go on to achieve a three-fold outcome. First, they will help increase bitcoin availability in the DeFi world. Following that, they will aid utility chains competing with Ethereum to expand their presence. Moreover, they will expand the Skybridge ecosystem itself by adding another bridge and additional use cases. Not just this, the collaboration between Swingby and Algorand will go a long way to solve issues for the blockchain community. Ultimately, they aim to support and finance more DeFi projects in the future. Moreover, Swingbys Skybridge is a staking-powered decentralized bridging protocol. It is used for the cross-chain movement of crypto assets. Further, it builds trustless bridges between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain as well as others. On the other hand, Algorand is the worlds first open-source and permissionless blockchain protocol. It is purely based on a proof-of-stake mechanism.

Let's take a look. Image source: Getty Images. Bitcoin vs. gold On a purely monetary level, bitcoin is valued at three times the price of an ounce of gold which closed near $1,290 an ounce this past week. News outlets have been particularly diligent in pointing out how bitcoin's value is leaving gold in the dust. But, it's gold that could still mop the floor with bitcoin if we compare the two based on market cap. According to a 2013 report from Thompson Reuters GFMS, it was believed that 171,300 tons of gold had either been mined or was still in the ground. Since there are 32,000 ounces per ton, we're talking about 5.482 billion ounces of gold in the entire world, based on this report. If each ounce was worth about $1,290, the world's gold supply would have an implied market cap of $7.07 trillion dollars. That's more than 100 times the market cap of bitcoin at its all-time high! It's also worth pointing out that numerous reports exist on the world's total gold supply, and some suggest as much as 2.5 million tons may be present (that's over 14 times what Thompson Reuters has predicted). This would imply a $103 trillion market value for gold, or nearly 1,500 times that of bitcoin. Long story short, bitcoin still has a very long way to go to truly catch gold. Image source: Getty Images. Bitcoin vs. the S&P 500 Conservatively, bitcoin also trails the market cap of the S&P 500 by a significant amount. The S&P 500 is made of up just a shade over 500 companies, many of which are the largest in the United States by market cap. According to data compiled by SiblisResearch.com, the S&P 500 had a market cap of $21.83 trillion as of June 30, 2017. Of course, the index has also risen nearly 1% since the second quarter ended, implying that its total market cap today is probably closer to $22 trillion, or about 319 times that of bitcoin. In fact, the largest U.S. stock, Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , could run circles around bitcoin by itself. Through Friday, Aug. 11, Apple had a market cap of $813.4 billion, which is almost 12 times higher than the entire market cap of bitcoin. What's more impressive, Apple ended its most recent quarter with a record cash pile of $261.5 billion. Admittedly, nearly all of this cash is being held in overseas markets, because Apple doesn't want to be taxed for the repatriation of this cash. Still, in theory, Apple could acquire all bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, and litecoin, the five largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, and still have approximately $152 billion in cash left over. Would Apple do such a thing? Not a chance. It's focused on returning cash to its shareholders and reinvesting in new technologies. But it does demonstrate just how tiny bitcoin is next to a behemoth like Apple, or the broad-based S&P 500. Image source: Getty Images. Bitcoin vs. the U.S. dollar Lastly, let's take a look at how bitcoin stacks up next to the currency it'd ultimately like to make go extinct -- the U.S. dollar. According to figures from the St. Louis Federal Reserve as of July 2017, the monetary base was nearly $3.8 trillion, including coins and deposits. The monetary base has increased more than fourfold from the Great Recession, and it's currently about 55 times larger than that of bitcoin, even after bitcoin's enormous run. Keep your distance from bitcoin and adjacent investments Despite its recent strength, this writer continues to believe that avoiding bitcoin is a smart move. Without true fundamentals to analyze, deriving a fair valuation on bitcoin is difficult to ascertain. We've witnessed numerous assets increase in value like this before throughout history, and practically every one wound up having its bubble burst eventually. My suspicion is bitcoin will be no different, and uninformed investors are going to be taken to the digital woodshed if they aren't careful. What's more, the lone bitcoin investment option in the stock market is grossly overvalued. Bitcoin Investment Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) is an ETF that currently holds about 173,014 bitcoin as of July 31, 2017. Given the recent run-up in bitcoin prices, the market cap of these bitcoin is just north of $700 million. However, the Bitcoin Investment Trust had a closing market cap on Friday of $1.05 billion, a nearly 50% premium, which is insane! Almost as insane as the 2% annual fee the fund charges. While bitcoin's underlying blockchain could be intriguing to businesses years down the road after it's been tested on a small scale, the current value of bitcoin makes little sense.

227,3 Predictions of Bitcoin's Price in 2020 -- and Why They'll All Probably Be Wrong,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 05:37:00,"Here are three scenarios that are entirely possible for bitcoin, both good and bad. Dec 21, 2017 at 6:37AM Author Bio Matt is a Certified Financial Planner based in South Carolina who has been writing for The Motley Fool since 2012. Matt specializes in writing about bank stocks, REITs, and personal finance, but he loves any investment at the right price. Follow him on Twitter to keep up with his latest work! Follow @TMFMathGuy Several respected financial-industry experts have made projections about the future value of bitcoin (BTC/USD), and they have literally ranged from $0 to $1,000,000 While there's no way of knowing what will happen with bitcoin over the next few years, it can certainly be fun to speculate. With that in mind, while I don't want to commit to a specific price prediction, here are three different scenarios that I could see playing out for bitcoin over the next couple of years, and why I'll probably be wrong about all three. Image source: Getty Images. Prediction 1: $500,000 if bitcoin becomes a widely used currency Well, $501,493 to be exact. This figure is based on seeing bitcoin surge in popularity to the point where it makes up 10% of the global money supply, an aggressive but realistically attainable percentage if everything goes right for bitcoin. To achieve this ultra-optimistic valuation, here's what I believe would need to happen. Bitcoin would need to become widely used as a currency -- not just as a speculative instrument, or even as a store of value. And there's a lot standing in the way before that could happen. For example, bitcoin would need to become far more user-friendly for people who aren't tech-savvy. In other words, it would need to become as easy as swiping a debit card at a payment terminal, or its road to widespread adoption will be very difficult. In addition, bitcoin's value will need to stabilize, which admittedly is contradictory to a prediction of a $500,000 value. Perhaps most importantly, the traffic capacity of the blockchain network will need to be greatly improved. Today, the entire bitcoin network is capable of processing only about three transactions per second, less than 1% of what it would need to process if it were being used constantly in payment transactions all over the world. Could it happen? Sure. Is it likely? Not by 2020. Prediction 2: $113,433 If bitcoin becomes a widely used store of value Someone recently told me that I was thinking of bitcoin all wrong when describing it as a currency. Instead of a payment mechanism, bitcoin's real use is as a store of wealth, like gold, this individual claimed. That certainly makes some sense. After all, a finite number of bitcoins will ever be created, and it's possible to make bitcoin holdings just as secure as physical gold, if not more so. As of this writing, the market value of all the gold that's ever been mined is roughly $7.6 trillion. And to be clear, I don't think bitcoin will ever come close to replacing gold as the world's preferred non-currency value storage mechanism. However, let's say bitcoin achieves one-fourth of the popularity as gold as a wealth storage vehicle. That would translate to a value of about $1.9 trillion for all bitcoins in existence, which is about $113,433 per coin. Prediction 3: $100 (or less) if bitcoin fails to overcome its challenges Since bitcoin is not yet a widely accepted form of payment, nor so many people use it as a store of wealth, it's fair to assume that this is a speculative rally and that some level of future success is priced into bitcoin at this point. Therefore, if enough time passes and bitcoin's progress toward mainstream acceptance is slow or non-existent, speculators could begin to head for the exists. In addition, there are several negative catalysts that could lead to a bitcoin crash. Just to name a few: A major bitcoin hack occurs, similar to the infamous Mt. Gox exchange's breach a few years ago. Selling pressure in bitcoin futures puts sustained, downward pressure on bitcoin. The problem of the network's capacity remains unsolved, and bitcoin transaction times get even worse. (They're taking several hours now.) Why these will probably be wrong In a nutshell, the first two predictions are different variations of ideal scenarios, and the third one is if bitcoin crashes. In reality, the price of bitcoin is governed by lots of factors, the combination of which is impossible to accurately predict, and the reality of what will happen is probably somewhere in between. In other words, I don't think a complete meltdown is particularly likely, but I don't think an ideal scenario that leads to a six-figure price tag is any more likely -- especially by 2020. And this is probably the biggest takeaway for prospective bitcoin investors. Buying any asset that could conceivably be worth either $100 or $500,000 within a couple of years is speculation, not investing. Keep this in mind, and don't buy bitcoin with any money you can't afford to lose.

Bitcoin rose above $60,000 to approach record highs on the weekend, breaking out of a two-week tight range and propelled by talk of constrained new supplies against evidence of wider adoption. The worlds biggest and best-known cryptocurrencyhit $61,222.22 on Saturday, its highest in nearly a month. It was slightly lower at $59,907 at 0500 GMT on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 116% from the years low of $27,734 on Jan. 4. It crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time on March 13, hitting a record $61,781.83 on Bitstampexchange, just after U.S. President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package into law. Justin dAnethan, sales manager at digital asset company Diginex in Hong Kong, said investors had turned their attention to stock markets and other cryptocurrencies in the past couple of weeks, leaving Bitcoin idling in the upper 50-thousand dollar levels. That changed just yesterday when we pierced through 60K. With miners not selling recently minted coins, on-exchange reserves hitting multi-year lows and an incessant stream of corporates, funds, large and small investors piling into BTC, we punched through, he said. Bitcoins stunning gains this year have been driven by its mainstream acceptance as an investment and a means of payment, accompanied by the rush of retail cash into stocks, exchange-traded funds and other risky assets. It soared this year as major firms, such as BNY Mellon, asset manager BlackRock Inc, credit card giant Mastercard Inc, backed cryptocurrencies, while those such as Tesla Inc Square Inc and MicroStrategy Inc invested in bitcoin. Big U.S. banks such as Morgan Stanley are also seeking to offer wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds.

230,3 Safer Ways to Invest in Bitcoin,nasdaq,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 00:00:00,"The Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) boom isn't over yet, as the cryptocurrency continues its upward trend. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin's price has jumped nearly 100% as investors scramble to get involved in the digital currency mania.Despite its popularity, though, it's still Apr 11, 2021 9:30AM EDT T (CRYPTO: BTC) boom isn't over yet, as the cryptocurrency continues its upward trend. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin's price has jumped nearly 100% as investors scramble to get involved in the digital currency mania. Despite its popularity, though, it's still an incredibly risky investment. While some investors believe it's a gamechanger others aren't as optimistic about its potential It's also experienced extreme price fluctuations, dropping by roughly 20% on three separate occasions since January of this year. Nobody knows what the future has in store for Bitcoin, and not everyone can stomach the risk involved in investing in the cryptocurrency. However, if you're determined to invest in Bitcoin, there are ways to limit your risk to better protect your money. 1. Make sure you have a well-diversified portfolio No matter where you choose to invest, it's always wise to have a well-diversified portfolio. However, if you're considering investing in Bitcoin, a healthy portfolio is especially critical to limit your risk. The more diversified your portfolio is, the less impact Bitcoin will have on your overall investments if it takes a turn for the worse. Aim to invest in at least 10 to 15 different stocks from multiple industries if you're choosing to invest in individual stocks. Or you can invest in index fundsor ETFs which provide instant diversification because each fund includes hundreds or even thousands of stocks. Also, it's a good idea to make sure your core portfolio is as stable as possible. For example, you could choose to invest the bulk of your money in S&P 500 index funds, then invest a very small amount in Bitcoin. That way, even if Bitcoin doesn't perform well, most of your money is still safe. 2. Invest through an ETF Investing in Bitcoin directly is possible, but it can be a hassle. Cryptocurrencies trade differently from regular stocks, and to invest directly in Bitcoin, you'd need to create a digital wallet and sign up on a cryptocurrency exchange. This can also be a security concern because if you lose the password to your digital wallet, you can't access your investments. A Bitcoin ETF would mimic the price of the cryptocurrency, but you wouldn't be investing in Bitcoin directly. In other words, the ETF would make it so that you can invest in Bitcoin like you would any other stock through a traditional exchange. Currently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn't approved any U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs. However, Bitcoin ETFs do exist in Europe and Canada, and some experts believe the SEC will start allowing them in the U.S. within the next year or so. If or when that happens, it will make it easier (and safer) for Americans to invest in Bitcoin. Keep in mind, though, that even if you do invest in a Bitcoin ETF, it's still important to have a diversified portfolio. Just as you would by investing in Bitcoin directly, make sure the bulk of your money is spread across a wide variety of stocks in addition to a Bitcoin ETF. 3. Consider crypto stocks Perhaps the safest way to invest in Bitcoin doesn't involve investing in Bitcoin at all, but instead investing in crypto stocks A crypto stock is a company that is involved in the cryptocurrency market in some way. Examples of crypto stocks include: Tesla: CEO Elon Musk recently announced a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin, and the company also allows payment in the form of Bitcoin. Square: The company allows users to offer cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, as a form of payment. It has also purchased more than $200 million worth of Bitcoin since October 2020. Salesforce: Although not directly involved with Bitcoin, the company builds blockchain solutions -- which is the technology behind cryptocurrencies. If Bitcoin becomes mainstream, Salesforce could benefit from it. The key to investing in crypto stocks is to invest in them because they are solid companies -- not solely because they're involved in cryptocurrencies. Strong companies will do well over the long term regardless of what happens with Bitcoin. But if Bitcoin does turn out to be a life-changing investment, these stocks may experience even higher returns. Is it time to invest in Bitcoin? There are a variety of ways to invest in Bitcoin, with some safer than others. Keep in mind, though, that at the end of the day, Bitcoin is still a highly volatile investment. Even if you try your best to mitigate your risk, only invest money you're prepared to lose. Bitcoin has the potential to be a lucrative investment, but it's not right for everyone. If you choose to invest in Bitcoin, be sure you've done your homework and invest wisely to keep your money as safe as possible. 10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021 Aaron Bush: What is your view on Bitcoin today and what do you think the opportunity is from here? You've already teased order of magnitude. But maybe to connect into this, what do you think is still misunderstood about Bitcoin today that lends itself to have that order of magnitude? Dan Morehead: Well, the thing I would say is, I think it's just not understood by enough people yet. As I mentioned, when I started investing in it, there was maybe 200,000 people using. Maybe there are 100 million people now, but there's still several billion people that don't have any exposure to Bitcoin, they don't really know about it. What I found over the years of financializing this new asset class is there really isn't any well-written, articulate paper that is negative on Bitcoin, and that's the holy grail. I have been asking people for that for years. Is I'd love to see an intelligent person write a lengthy paper on why Bitcoin is wrong or a failure and not a good investment. That's really the punchline  -- there isn't that. You occasionally get soundbites or something like that, but no one actually ever writes a very long negative piece on that. That's basically what happens, is that the capture rate on people is so high that once someone actually spends a few days, reads about it, thinks about it, they normally would end up buying some, and that's what's been driving the pricing up for 10 years. What do I think about Bitcoin now? It's been going up at a compound annual growth rate of 213% for 10 years. Again, I've never seen an asset like that; it's just off the charts. It does have some bubbles and it has had some crazy bear markets. But if you graph the price exponentially over the last 10 years, it looks pretty consistent. Again, it occasionally gets ahead of itself, it occasionally gets behind. Right now, although it's rallied a lot since the pandemic lows a year ago, it's still below its long-term trend line. I think Bitcoin is fairly valued, it's certainly not a bubble right now. I think it can go up quite a bit. We have a bunch of things coming together at the same time. The tax being built out for the last 12 years. That story is on track, it's great. But the two big things that happened recently is, the monetary stimulus response to the virus is literally off the charts. The U.S. now prints more money every month than it did in the first 200 years of its existence. That has to increase the price of things where quantity can't be eased. It just that's the way it works. If you print trillions of dollars of new pieces of paper money, it's going to take more money to buy things like gold or Bitcoin or even the S&P 500. That to my mind is the best proof of our thesis here that the unlimited printing of money is going to increase the price in that paper money of things that can't be increased. The S&P has had a huge to earnings because obviously the pandemic has caused enormous financial damage to companies, but the price of the S&P 500 is way up. That's just because there's so much money sloshing around. It's driving up the price of Bitcoin, it's driving up the price of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) , and all the other blockchains. Right at the same time, we're making it much easier for both individuals and institutions to get exposure. A long time ago, it was really hard, you had to take a selfie with your passport and send it to an exchange and wait for a week to get approved and all that stuff. Now, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has just turned on 300 million people, and they can buy Bitcoin with a click, so it's just a lot easier to get exposure. I think over the next six or eight months, you can see major Wall Street firms turn on their wealth management platform to allow high net worth individuals to buy Bitcoin. All those things are going to drive the price up. Aaron Bush owns shares of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and PayPal Holdings. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Bitcoin and PayPal Holdings.

Following a 1,000,000% Gain, a Slow-Motion Crash Meet the world's most volatile, and potentially promising, currency. Mike Pienciak Updated: Apr 6, 2017 at 6:02PM No, there's not the slightest touch of hyperbole to that headline. Rather, it's the completely accurate, if exceedingly brief, tale of Bitcoin's short life. Far from dead, however, the digital currency continues to hold promise, and its trajectory bears more than a passing glance. When I first wrote about Bitcoin in June, it had recently gone parabolic, first crossing the $1 mark, and then rapidly shooting up to the $9 range (if you don't know a Bitcoin from a Malaysian ringgit, see my previous article ). The ascent, however, was still in the middle innings. Not two weeks later, the Bitcoin was trading at more than $30, having appreciated 10,000-fold since dollar-denominated trading began in 2010. Then, of course, the inevitable occurred. Exuberance gave way to sanity and profit taking, and the Bitcoin first plummeted, then more gradually but steadily slid, eventually finding its way back down to the current trading range of $2-$3. Was a bubble phenomenon in the cards for Bitcoin from the get-go? In mid-2010, lead core Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen cautioned: Bitcoin will get mentioned someplace with lots of readers, a bunch of those readers will like the idea and try to buy Bitcoins, their price will rise which will draw even more people to ""invest,"" which will drive the price up even more ... until people decide that the price isn't going to rise any more and everybody rushes to sell before the price drops. I predict there will be between one and five Bitcoin bubbles (price will double or more and then crash back down below the starting price) in the next four years. Rendering Bitcoin susceptible to bubble dynamics is its immediate appeal as a genuine, if fledgling, ; its relatively illiquid trading market acts as a double whammy. Consider that daily volume above $1 million represents a heavy day, and that total volume in the past year amounts to roughly $75 million. Compare that to SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) , where average daily dollar volume is in the billions. As an alternative to holding one's wealth in greenbacks, Bitcoin is on the map, but just barely. As such, it's a speculator's dream. But what about the long-term prospects? In an email, Andresen relayed that he remains upbeat on Bitcoin's future. Furthermore, he mentioned ""dozens"" of development-stage projects, including secure ""Bitcoin wallets"" for cellphones. Although he doesn't see such ventures as critical to Bitcoin's success, they could, in my view, provide a notable boost. As for potential legal issues, which have been cited elsewhere in the media as Bitcoin's eventual death knell, Andresen is likewise optimistic. ""New technologies are always ahead of the law,"" he quips, adding, ""Bitcoin doesn't fit neatly into any of the categories our legal system has created for 'things that act as money,'...I wouldn't be at all surprised to see Bitcoin first really take off somewhere else in the world, where the financial system is more open to innovation."" Of course, price stability is the real key to Bitcoin's future, and here, even Andresen was surprised by the magnitude of the recent run-up. Moreover, he sees continued volatility across the next few years. For now, many may be put off by Bitcoin. And for good reason. Even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEX: ^DJI) now routinely swings hundreds of points in either direction on a day-to-day basis, it's up 2.3% since Bitcoin's June peak. That beats a roughly 90% loss. Meanwhile, in the gold world, ""boring"" old industry behemoths Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) (NYSE: ABX) are up 32.5% and 18%, respectively, in the same time frame. Going forward, Bitcoin projects such as those cited above, which aim to expand the marketplace, should help smooth the price volatility. Ultimately, however, Bitcoin cannot succeed until the market begins to view it according to its design -- as a legitimate currency with predictable supply growth -- and not a get-rich-quick investment. If you want to bet on when that will happen, there's likely someone out there who's eager to accept your wager -- in Bitcoins. Want to diversify out of fiat currencies?

With the premium on bitcoin futures expanding to as high as 40% per annum for the June expiry, there is a lot of interest from cash and carry traders to arbitragethe premium and lock-in risk-free gains, Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. Cash and carry arbitrage is a market-neutral strategy aimed to profit from price discrepancies in one or more markets. It involves buying an asset in the spot market against a short position in the futures market when the futures draw a significant premium relative to the spot price. That way, traders pocket a fixed return, as the premium decays over time and converges with the spot price on the expiry date. Bitcoin futures basis Source: Skew According to data source Skew, bitcoins June expiry futures listed on major exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, OKEx, BitMEX, and Deribit are currently drawing an annualized premium of 44% to 48%.

HSBC Now Bars Clients From Buying Crypto and Crypto-Related Stocks Like Microstrategy British bank HSBC has reportedly become more strict with its crypto policy. The bank now prohibits its customers from buying the stock of public companies that are holding bitcoin in its treasury. An HSBC customerhas shared a message he said he received from the bank, informing him of a policy change regarding cryptocurrencies, naming bitcoin and ethereum as examples. The banks new policy applies to products related or referencing the performance of virtual currencies. The notice reads: HIDC [HSBC Invest Direct] will not participate in facilitating (buy and/or exchange) product related to virtual currencies, or products related or referencing to the performance of virtual currency. The notice singles out one stock in particular. Our records show that your HSBC Invest Direct account is holding Microstrategy Inc-A  MSTR-US, a virtual currency product. While Microstrategy does not offer any crypto services, it has been heavily buying BTCsince October last year. The company has amassed almost 100K BTCand has made acquiring the cryptocurrency one of its primary goals. HSBCs notice continues: While we will permit the holdings of MSTR-US to be held and/or sold/ transfer-out in your HSBC Invest Direct account, new purchases or transfers-in will not be allowed. A notice from HSBC posted on Twitter by @camadamus. Source: @camadamus The British bank did not specify how much bitcoin a company has to hold in order for its stock to be banned from the bank.

It sure does not sound like it is. They wont allow us to buy Microstrategy.

This is the highest point reached by BTC since March 15. Reddit Bitcoin (BTC) has recently broken above the $60,000 psychological level. This is the highest point reached by the largest cryptocurrency since March 15 when BTC fell to $53,000 per coin. The virtual currency has pushed other altcoins higher. However, it will be definitely important to see how the market will behave in the coming days. Bitcoin Ends the Week Above $60k Bitcoin has ended the week above $60,000. This has allowed several other virtual currencies to move higher as well. Thus, we see the whole crypto market in positive territory. According to CoinMarketCap , Ethereum (ETH) is now traded 4.10% up in the last 24 hours. Surprisingly, Binance Coin (BNB) continues to move higher. The virtual currency used at the Binance exchange is now close to $500 being traded at $475. In the last 24 hours, BNB moved by over 14%. XRP, Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Uniswap (UNI), Litecoin (LTC) and Chainlink are also registering large gains. XRP moved higher by 12%. Meanwhile, DOT and UNI registered smaller gains (2.82% and 1.32% respectively). Litecoin is trying to catch Uniswap with a price increase of 4% in the last 24 hours. At the moment, this legacy coin has a price of $233 and a market valuation of $15.55 billion. Finally, Chainlink is just moving higher by 0.65%. During a conversation with UseTheBitcoin, Konstantin Anissimov, the Executive Director at CEX.IO explained that the next logic level for Bitcoin would be to reach $61,000. However, if it gets rejected, the price could move to $56,000 before continuing higher. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to be in a price discovery stage. Anissimov explained that Ethereum moves might not be as aggressive as Bitcoins but daily and weekly gains for Ethereum have been larger than those of Bitcoin. As we can see in the chart above, there has been strong resistance for BTC price close to $59,400 and $60,100. Thus, it will be very important to see if Bitcoin will be able to make these resistance levels support. Weekends tend to manage lower volumes for BTC and other virtual currencies. However, Bitcoins previous all-time high was reached during a weekend with a spike in volume as we have seen earlier today. Indeed, the volume spike that Bitcoin experienced in the last hours was the largest since BTCs all-time high in March.

247,The Secret to Legally Paying Zero Taxes on Bitcoin Profits,nasdaq,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 00:00:00,"The price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has soared exponentially within the last year, allowing investors to quadruple their gains without lifting a finger. If you're thinking about selling a fraction or all of your Bitcoin investment, make sure you understand how taxes for Bitcoin wo Apr 10, 2021 6:04AM EDT T (CRYPTO: BTC) has soared exponentially within the last year, allowing investors to quadruple their gains without lifting a finger. If you're thinking about selling a fraction or all of your Bitcoin investment, make sure you understand how taxes for Bitcoin work Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that offers investors more autonomy than other investment options. But investing in it does not mean you are exempt from taxes. You may have to give the IRS a piece of the profits you earn. However, there's a way to lower your tax bill (or even legally pay no taxes on your earnings from cryptocurrency) if you meet the rules for long-term gains tax treatment. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know to reduce your tax bill on Bitcoin-- maybe even to zero --when you file your return. Image source: Getty Images. Time is on your side The IRS views Bitcoin as property instead of cash or currency. This means that selling your investment for a profit will trigger capital gains taxesjust like the sale of stocks would. There are two types of capital gains taxes: short term and long term. If you hold your bitcoin investment for a year or less before selling it, you would have a short-term capital gain Your earnings will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rates which can be anywhere from 10% to 37%. The best deal on your tax bill comes when you hold your Bitcoin investments for over a year, because the long-term capital gains tax rules are the key to unlocking the 0% tax bracket on your Bitcoin profits. Maximizing your gains The secret to make your way into the lower long-term capital gains tax bracket is to pay attention to your holding periodand keep tabs on your taxable income. Long-term capital gains grant you access to the 0%, 15%, and 20% tax rates. To qualify for these favorable tax rates, you must hold your Bitcoin investments over a year before selling them. Then, pay attention to your income. A single filer can have taxable income up to $40,400 to claim the 0% tax bracket on long-term capital gains in 2021. Let's say you are single with a taxable income of $25,000 in wages and $15,000 in long-term capital gains from Bitcoin. You would be eligible to pay zero taxes on your Bitcoin profits because your total income of $40,000 is less than the threshold for single filers. Once you cross that income threshold, you get bumped up into the 15% long-term capital gains tax bracket. So in the above example, if you had $20,000 in long-term gains from Bitcoin, the first $15,400 would get the 0% rate, but the remaining $4,600 would get taxed at 15%. Obviously, you don't want to give up the chance to earn extra income just because some of it will get taxed. But if you have the option to choose when that income comes in, smart tax planning can save you some money. Take a look at the 2021 long-term capital gains tax brackets below for your filing status and the income threshold that would qualify you for the 0% tax bracket. Married joint filers receive the largest income threshold -- up to $80,800 taxable income -- to pay zero taxes on capital gains. Single Filers With Taxable Income of...

The much-needed breakout in the BTC /USD pair is now emerging successfully out of the Bollinger Bands. The thin liquidity of the weekend is supporting high volatility trading. The resistance at $60k has been breached successfully by the bulls on the back of heavy buying action. Now, the traders confront the $62k barrier according to Bitcoin price prediction Large long positions have not been liquidated yet which means the bulls are not booking profits in anticipation of higher price levels. Optimistic crypto market is emboldening the bulls to create long positions with targets higher than $62,500 resistance level.

The MACD has also completed a bullish crossover and is heading higher with room to run upwards. An overextended bull rally will take the price towards $62,357 resistance before the current rally loses steam. The benchmark support has come up to touch $50,000 level further preventing any downside risk to the pair. Bitcoin price prediction conclusion: Next bull run has begun targeting $65k The Bitcoin price predictionis now in bullish territory. The 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average is supporting the price underneath the pair. The technical indicators are highly bullish including RSI, Stochastic RSI, MACD, and overstretched Bollinger Bands. If the pair closes above $60k on a daily basis, it will act as a catalyst for a run higher towards $65,150 level. On the contrary, any minor correction can stall the bull run on the hourly charts. A sporadic selling can overpower the bullish overtone and take the price towards $57k support first. The negative trajectory will end at $55,000 level if the selling action intensifies. Barring an extended sell-off, Bitcoin price predictionis skewed towards a bullish momentum. Disclaimer.The information provided is not trading advice.

In an opinion piece written by Noah Smith, a former assistant finance professor turned columnist, took aim at the Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining industry in March, suggesting that the constantly growing energy consumption of the network is simply unsustainable. Smiths belief is that more countries will clamp down on Bitcoin mining as they use more power, given that the increasing price of BTC is always matched by rising hash rates. While Coin Metrics founder Nic Carter has rebutted some of the points raised in Smiths column, there still seems to be divided opinion around the amount of energy that Bitcoin mining draws, the sources of this energy and the carbon footprint that the industry has on the planet.",http://investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/all-that-mined-is-not-green-bitcoins-carbon-footprint-hard-to-estimate-2470962

PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel labels BTC as Chinas Financial Weapon against the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin price could be due for a massive move as key on-chain metrics reset and others turn bullish. Bitcoins mainstream adoption has soared over the last couple of months, with institutionslike Visa Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and others dipping their toes in the BTC markets. Likewise, prices look primed to advance further despite the ongoing consolidation phase. Eastern markets in the spotlight The kimchi premium refers to the difference between the BTC/KRW and the BTC/USD trading pairs. Different factors like domestic capital controls, limitations of Korean exchanges, and retail demand tend to affect the price of Bitcoin against the South Korean won relative to other fiat currencies. History shows that spikes in the BTC/KRW premium occur during bull runs and often before market corrections. The kimchi premium recently surged by 18%, causing panic among market participants. Bitcoin Kimchi Premium chart As fears of a potential steep correctionsurged, Bitcoin price remained range-bound trading between $60,103 and $54,892 over the past ten days. Adding fuel to the FUD, billionaire Peter Thiel questionedwhether Bitcoin could be a Chinese financial weapon and urged the U.S. government to consider tighter regulations. I do wonder whether at this point, Bitcoin should also be thought [of] in part as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S If Chinas long Bitcoin, perhaps from a geopolitical perspective, the U.S. should be asking some tougher questions about exactly how that works. Thiels remarks come after China has managed to controlfor more than 65% of the Bitcoin network's hashing power. Such high levels of concentration have been a focal point of concern for several years. Especially when considering that the U.S. hashrate share is nearly nine times smaller than that of China and most mining equipment manufacturers are headquartered in the Asian nation. Bitcoin hashrate distribution chart Regardless of Thiels call for more regulation on crypto, Hester Peirce, Commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), affirmed that the U.S. has moved past the point of banning Bitcoin. The so-called 'Crypto Mom' believes the pioneer cryptocurrencys decentralized nature would likely outpace any attempt to limit its use, so it would be a foolish thing for the government to try to do that."" Instead, Peirce vowed more adoption toward the approval of a Bitcoin ETF In the three years that Ive been in the Commission, the (Bitcoin) market has matured tremendously. Pierce maintains that direct involvement of institutions in Bitcoin is making things comfortable about the underlying markets, hinting about how regulators have cozied up to the idea of a Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin price continues to consolidate, on-chain metrics flip bullish Bitcoin price has remained stagnant over the past ten days, which allowed the 20-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) to climb up to $40,450. Investors should keep a close eye on this trend-following indicator. It served as a critical support level during previous bull runs allowing buyers to scoop up more BTC at a discount. The daily chart shows that even though BTC has been losing steam, the emergence of an ascending parallel channel also kept prices at bay during the most recent correction. On the other hand, the weekly chart reveals the formation of an ascending triangle pattern. A breakout from the triangles x-axis at $59,090 could propel BTC by 27% to a new all-time high of $75,163. Interestingly, this bullish target coincides with the 141.4% Fibonacci extension level. BTC/USD 1-day, 1-week chart The last few weeks have seen a choppy price action due to investors overleveraged long and short positions. The recent surge in Bitcoins Open Interest to $77 billion, combined with resetting funding rates, suggests that such market participants will be scarce. Hence, going forward, Bitcoin will most likely move out of the consolidation period and enter a price discovery mode. Bitcoin Open Interest and Funding rate chart While everything seems to be looking up for Bitcoin, the Pi Cycle Top indicator hints at an incoming reversal. This index consists of the 111-day SMA and 350-day SMA with a standard deviation of two plotted against the Bitcoin price. The last three times the short SMA moved above the long SMA, it has signaled a cycle top to within three days. Now, these moving averages have moved eerily close to each other, indicating that a death cross might soon occur.

251,How long the bull run will last?,pulse,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 12:10:04,"The bull cycle of Bitcoin that set off in 2020 is still in full swing. Heres how Diana Hamilton wants us to have that casual Friday slay But no bull market phase can last forever, and a lot of new investors and wondering how long this simple cycle will last. Based on historical data and new developments in the crypto market, we provide a list of the main factors that are associated with Bitcoin's bull runs and their length. The main factors The key factors associated with the bull cycle are the Bitcoin halving that happened in 2020, on top of the ratio of supply and demand, and promotion of BTC investment by famous investors as well as institutional investors. First and foremost, when you look at the historical data, you will see that after each halving, there is a significant bull market phase. One example is the notable bull market phase in 2017 when Bitcoin for the first time has surpassed $19,000 by the end of 2017. One year prior to that, there was a halving. So, this pattern is expected for most of the users because it diminishes the number of new BTC that are produced in the network. Therefore, the supply is declining with each halving. In addition, the demand is rising; especially as we said, there is a huge interest regarding the cryptocurrencies from institutional investors as well as celebrities. In other words, in 2020, a lot of demand for BTC came from these investors, and subsequently, the demand was increasing not only faster than supply but, at the same time, it was also greater than the available pool of BTC. Another reason why this bull cycle lasts longer than the other is the availability of online exchange platforms that feature high-end technology. To give an example, on Bitcoin Billionairemembers can earn up to 70% of profits on a daily basis thanks to its state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology. Moreover, this is an exceptionally good option for crypto newbies because it includes a detailed trading guide that will help you learn about crypto trading. Future predictions Typically, a bull run of Bitcoin can last from a few months to years and they last longer than bear market cycles. The bear market phases are marked by low volatility and more frequent. When it comes to Bitcoin, there is a cyclical nature and a pattern regarding each bull cycle that happens after a halving. How long it would last again depends on the ratio of the supply and demand, based on the above-mentioned factors. A lot of predictions regarding the Bitcoin rally are quite positive. Bitcoin supporters believe that the price will hit $100,000 by the end of 2021, while others estimate a higher price of over $250,000 by July. Further, a lot of people expect the price to break $10 million by 2050. Conclusion It's very likely that this bull run will continue well into 2022 (experts predict it will last between another 9-22 months), although no one can know for sure, we see a lot of existing holders, as well as new investors, are treating Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Actually, most new organizations and investors want to obtain BTC because they consider it a good store of value. So, when Bitcoin enters a bear market phase its value will still probably be quite high, and according to the historical data, the price of Bitcoin never falls back to the same price after a halving. Otherwise, every four years, it is expected for Bitcoin again to enter a bull cycle or after a halving. The next halving is expected to happen in 2024. JOIN OUR PULSE COMMUNITY!

252,"The major Ethereum support area is $1,800 but weaker than Bitcoins",fxstreet,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 11:52:08,"The price of Ether (ETH) is hovering near its all-time high once again, while Bitcoin (BTC) is still far from surpassing its record high at $60,805. B | 4/9/2021 11:52:08 AM GMT The price of Ether (ETH) is hovering near its all-time high once again, while Bitcoin (BTC) is still far from surpassing its record high at $60,805. But despite ETH demonstrating strong technical momentum and entering price discovery, on-chain analysis finds that its support is ""narrower"" than Bitcoin. Simply put, ETH faces a bigger risk of seeing a deeper pullback than Bitcoin in the foreseeable future, if the market turns around. USD cost of Ethereum held since November 2020. Source: Chainalysis, Phillip Gradwell Why does Ethereum have a weaker support area than Bitcoin Phillip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, said that ETH price has narrower support near its record high compared to Bitcoin. If the market corrects, the next major ETH support level is around $1,800, Gradwell noted. Based on the accumulation trend of ETH, Gradwell explained that the strongest level of demand is at $1,800. He said: ""The Ethereum pricereached a new all-time high this weekbut cost curve analysissuggests the peak Ethereum price has a narrower base of support than the peak bitcoin price, with the next strongest level of observed demand for Ethereum at $1,800. Gradwell used a data point called ""the USD cost of Ethereum held""  which is similar to whale clusters for Bitcoin  to estimate at which price level investors accumulated ETH. If the $1,800 support level gets broken and the market sees a sizable correction, the economist said that $1,500 is a ""particularly strong"" next level of support for ETH. A drop to $1,500 would mean ETH would see a 30% drop from the current price of around $2,100. Historically, 30% pullbacks occurred frequently during bull cycles, but in the recent cryptocurrency marketuptrend, there has not been many 20% to 30% pullbacks compared to the run-up in 2017. Nonetheless, Gradwell emphasized that $1,500 is the macro support level for ETH in the short to medium term. He added: ""The ETH market has changed radically in recent months, with a significant increase in the cost of acquisition for over 50 million ETH, out of a total supply of 115M. Support at $1,500 is particularly strong, with 33.3M ETH acquired above this level at a total cost of $58 billion."" One key reason ETH might have a narrower support base than Bitcoin could be the small number of long-time HODLers. After the peak in 2017, Gradwell found that a small cohort of investors held ETH despite seeing major losses. The economist said that such a trend supports the concern that ETH has a weaker support base, at least relative to Bitcoin. Traders expect ETH to continue rallying above ATH In the short term, traders still expect ETH to see a broader uptrend despite the concerns for a narrow support base. A pseudonymous trader known as ""Blunts"" said that based on the bottoming out formation on the 4-hour chart, ETH would likely see another record high before BTC. The trader said: ""Looks like that was the $eth low. At this rate eth will be at ath before btc."" ETH/USD 4-hour price chart with key levels. Source: TradingView.com, Blunts Atop the favorable technical market structure, according to Glassnode, the hash rate of the Ethereum blockchain network has hit a new all-time high. Hence, both fundamentals and price technicals suggest that the momentum of ETH price has a good chance of sustainability in the near term.",https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/the-major-ethereum-support-area-is-1-800-but-weaker-than-bitcoins-202104091152

Thats the $64,000 question. Or, perhaps the million-dollar question, if some more bullish projections play out Source: Shutterstock The overall mad rush into financial assets like stocks and crypto by retail investors, coupled with the entrance of serious institutional money is behind its nearly eight-fold rise over the past 12 months. Some believe the best has yet to come. Others see higher prices ahead, followed by a tremendous collapse Whos right and whos wrong? Only time will tell. But trying to time Bitcoin may not be the best way to play the popular cryptocurrency. Instead, the best approach may be to concede its too risky to try to get rich from Bitcoin and taking a cautious approach by buying a little for peace of mind. Why? If you try to go all-in on crypto this late in the game, you stand the risk of entering a position at or near the top. The results could be disastrous to your finances. But if you buy just a little, you will see a small benefit if it works out. But your position is small enough that you wont be ruined if the bears are right and the bubble pops. Sure, this isnt the most exciting way to play crypto. But if you are kicking yourself for not buying it before the pop, this may be the next best thing. The Merits of Bitcoin as Schmuck Insurance The phrase  schmuck insurance  may have originated in the world of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The phrase was originally coined to describe situations where the seller of a company holds onto a small stake in the business, in case the business becomes much more valuable under new ownership. In short, a hedge for the seller to save face, in case he or she sells at too low a price. But this phrase can also be used to rationalize owning Bitcoin. In fact, Chamath Palihapitiya has used the phrasehimself back in 2019 to describe the benefits of owning it. A longtime BTC bull, the outspoken financier further added it was the single best hedge against the traditional financial infrastructure. In hindsight, this has played out, to some extent. The aggressive changes in Central Banking policyin response to Covid-19 have accelerated demand for alternatives like Bitcoin. Yet, the positive impact of this on crypto prices could already be played out. So, why still buy BTC as schmuck insurance? This phrase when it comes to this crypto isnt limited to only describing it as a bet against Federal Reserve policy. You can also use it to describe a peace of mind approach to owning it. That is, buying it to avoid any future regrets if it ends up continuing to surge in price. Taking the Peace of Mind Approach Those reading this today who do not own BTC may feel regret not going long at lower prices. But, unless you have a time machine, theres no way to fix this. So, whats the best alternative? Taking a small position in Bitcoin isnt about getting rich. Its a move to avoid future rumination in case the crypto bulls are correct and Bitcoin continue going higher. Sure, buying this in case it goes up sounds more like gambling than true investing. But, as InvestorPlaces Mark Hake recently put it, how is buying Bitcoin, despite a lack of inherent value, any different than buying gold?Like BTC, gold derives its value from perception rather than economic reality. That is to say, theres nothing wrong with buying it as a wager on price appreciation, even if you cant forecast its potential upside like you can with a stock. Now, what if the opposite happens? You buy it today, at around $57,000. But, shortly after your purchase, the bubble bursts. Prices fall 30%, 40%, maybe even 50%. Youll be sitting on some losses. But, given the small size of your position relative to your portfolio, said losses wont have a material impact. The Bottom Line The bull case for BTC makes perfect sense. Fed policy, coupled with President Joe Bidens multi-trillion dollar spending plans back up the claim that Bitcoin will continue to increase as rising inflation eats up the value of a dollar. Yet, this alone hardly justifies betting the ranch at todays prices. Even with monetary policy encouraging investment in it, the bubble could still burst. Plus, there are many less volatile ways to protect your nest egg against inflation However, if you regret not buying Bitcoin at lower prices, buying a little now may provide the peace of mind you need.

256,Washington State educational organizations targeted in cryptojacking spree,zdnet,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 09:32:33,"The lucrative nature of cryptocurrency means no industry is safe. Why some governments are getting cyber crime gangs to do their hacking for them (ZDNet YouTube) Otherwise known as cryptojacking attacks, this form of assault is usually mired in stealth as the overall aim is to quietly install cryptocurrency mining components that leech stolen computational power. Miner software abused by cyberattackers may attempt to generate cryptocurrency including Monero (XMR), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH), and even if small amounts are mined, compromising large numbers of systems can make these attacks lucrative. According to a new advisoryreleased by Palo Alto Network's Unit 42 team, cryptojacking incidents have recently taken place against educational institutions in Washington State. The researchers say that a UPX-packed cpuminer -- used to mine LTC and BTC -- has been delivered by way of malicious traffic. The first attack, spotted on February 16, involved a malicious HTTP request sent to a domain owned by an educational establishment that at first seemed like a ""trivial command injection vulnerability,"" according to the team, but upon further examination, revealed that it was actually a command for a webshell backdoor. If deployment is successful, the backdoor is then able to call and execute the cryptomining payload. In addition, the malware will download a mini shell that pretends to be a wp-load.php file. ""Since the mini shell is not moved elsewhere, we speculate that the current directory of the mini shell, as well as the backdoor, is a web directory exposed to the internet,"" the report says.

257,This Fund Manager Thinks Bitcoin's Value Is Limited,fool,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 09:12:00,"Mark Spitznagel oversees about $6 billion worth of assets. Although he despises fiat currency, he doesn't think the bitcoin is a solution. Nov 25, 2013 at 10:12AM Author Bio Sam has a love of all things finance. He writes about tech stocks and consumer goods. Mark Spitznagel, the founder of Universa Capital (a fund with about $6 billion in assets ), thinks the bitcoin is scary and potentially dangerous. In a recent conversation, Spitznagel told me that, despite his ardent free market principals, he's skeptical of the emerging digital currency. Many of the bitcoin's supporters see it as a way to circumvent the existing monetary paradigm, an alternative currency to facilitate transactions outside of the bounds of governments and central banks. (More extreme supporters have gone so far as to argue that it will serve as a way to destroy governments everywhere.) But Spitznagel isn't buying it -- although he argues in his new book, The Dao of Capital, that the current monetary system , he believes the bitcoin is a mere extension of the dollar. The bitcoin lacks intrinsic value Like the U.S. dollar, which lost its gold convertibility in 1971, the bitcoin is essentially backed by nothing. Although the Federal Reserve (or any other central bank for that matter) can't intervene to increase the supply of bitcoins, the bitcoin is, like fiat currency, reliant on general confidence for its value. ""A medium of exchange really needs to have an intrinsic value of its own, typically a commodity value, through a long vetting process. We organically created this man-made concept of money because bartering is hard -- I have to find someone that wants exactly what I have to exchange -- money is much more dynamic and fluid. But money must come out of a commodity that has an exchange as well as an intrinsic value of its own,"" Spitznagel told me. ""This has of course been bastardized by government fiat currency."" Spitznagel is a proponent of Austrian economics, a controversial school of thought that believes the government should take a very limited role in economic matters. He's critical of fiat currencies, like the dollar, because their value can be manipulated by central banks, in the process creating economic booms and busts. Like other Austrians, Spitznagel favors precious metals as money, and believes gold is the perfect medium of exchange (but ). Currencies should not be so volatile Historically, gold has held its value over long periods of time; indeed, the stability of gold prices has been seen as one of the metal's greatest virtues. The U.S. dollar certainly hasn't been as stable, losing about 98% of its purchasing power since 1913. But the dollar's decline has mostly been orderly; certainly nothing like the wild jumps seen in the price of bitcoins in recent weeks. As I write this, one bitcoin is trading for around $800, but earlier this month, that same bitcoin was going for over $900. In October, that bitcoin was worth about $150, and last December, it was worth around one third of that. ""The fact that the bitcoin has had such wild swings in value should make you question it,"" Spitznagel explained. ""Real money, a store of value for exchange, doesn't move around that much."" Why stop at 21 million? ""Why 21 million?"" Spitznagel asked me, in reference to the bitcoin's limit. Built within the bitcoin system is a hard cap -- no matter what, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in existence. The actual number is somewhat arbitrary, and that concerns Spitznagel. To create new currency,  bitcoin ""miners"" use their PCs to solve complex computational problems. The reward for solving these problems is new bitcoins, but over time, the problems become harder to solve and the number of bitcoins given per reward decreases. Right now, the reward is 25 bitcoins, but in 2016, it will fall to 12.5. The way the math works out, the number of bitcoins will never exceed 21 million. As to why there's 21 million in particular, I couldn't give Spitznagel a satisfying answer, and indeed, there really isn't one -- designed a different way, the bitcoin cap could've easily been 50 million, or a trillion, or five. Bitcoin's supporters would argue that it doesn't matter -- that it's the process, not the limit, that makes bitcoin work. This is intended to keep bitcoin creation stable, and to limit the number of bitcoins in existence. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which generally depreciate over time due to inflation, bitcoin's hard limit prevents inflation, and bitcoins themselves should actually become more valuable over time. Economist Paul Krugman has criticized this inherent property of the bitcoin for baking deflation into the system, and encouraging bitcoin owners to hoard the digital currency. Just an extension of the dollar ""I see this as just another expression of the dollar -- [the bitcoin's] value arises from its convertibility into fiat currency. Frankly, it's kind of scary to me,"" Spitznagel said. Many bitcoin supporters probably agree with Spitznagel on many issues -- the bitcoin has caught on among government critics; the Libertarian Party in the United States even accepts bitcoin donations. But is the bitcoin really the perfect alternative to government-controlled currencies? Is the bitcoin the new gold standard for a digital age? Spitzangel doesn't think so, and I have to agree. The bitcoin remains tied to government currencies -- it only has value because it can be exchanged for fiat currency. The Bitcoin Foundation, for example, pays its employees in bitcoins, but only in a superficial sense. Their salaries are set in dollars, and the number of bitcoins they receive is based on the bitcoin's dollar value. Moreover, opponents of fiat currencies frequently cite their instability as a reason for their opposition, and the bitcoin's orderly creation and 21 million cap should theoretically keep the bitcoin's value stable over time;yet, over the bitcoin's life, traditional currencies have been far more stable -- the sort of wild, regular $50 daily shifts the bitcoin has experienced are unheard of. Behind those wild swings is a group online supporters convinced that bitcoin is the future of money. Sadly, when the bubble bursts, many of those supporters are going to be left holding the digital bag.

258,Digital Currencies Are the Future of Global Finance  Here are 4 Reasons Why,abcmoney,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 08:02:39,"Background The virtual currencies were incepted almost a decade ago upon the creation of Bitcoins in 2009. Since then, the trajectory of BTC has not been a straightforward or smooth one, but rather fluctuating, proving to be beneficial for the traders and the investors at time, while causing financial distress and losses for the same [] Digital Currencies Are the Future of Global Finance  Here are 4 Reasons Why by 09/04/2021 Background The virtual currencies were incepted almost a decade ago upon the creation of Bitcoins in 2009. Since then, the trajectory of BTC has not been a straightforward or smooth one, but rather fluctuating, proving to be beneficial for the traders and the investors at time, while causing financial distress and losses for the same crypto market. One of the main reasons behind the hesitation and under-confidence of the people in virtual currencies is the uncertainty and variability in its prices over the course of time. People even believe that this uncertainty and fluctuation is here to stay and will only negatively affect the market and investors in it. However, we believe this to be untrue, and therefore we are writing this article in an attempt to shed light upon the reasons we believe that not only will the crypto will continue to perform well, but also shape and become the future of global finance Here is a list of the top 4 reasons we have identified: 1. It is Immortal The technology upon which the digital currencies are based on and created is known as the blockchain technology. It should be known that blockchain technology is impenetrable and is well-known for the fact that it is immortal  i.e. it cannot die or be wiped off. This implies that this technology will never cease to exist. As long as the nodes in this technology run and are being used, this technology will not perish, and the only way that the blockchain can be wiped off from the world could be through the demolition of all the computer systems, internet and the electricity in the world  something we all know is not going to happen, therefore blockchain technology is indestructible. Download the big money rush appto learn more about Bitcoin and automated trading in order to make great gains and reduce losses. 2. It is a Perfect Substitute for Fiat Currency Digital Currencies can also be utilized as substitutes or alternatives for all the fiat currencies such as the popular U.S Dollar, British Pound or Chinese Yen etcetera. Although there are several advantages of fiat itself, however, there are many benefits of crypto which beat the traditional fiat currency. Among these advantages, the major ones are the rapid transfer of payment on crypto channels, the low transaction charges when compared with other conventional methods, no intervention of a third-party regulatory institution and many others. One key advantage of crypto comes in the form of a greater ease of making international payments. As compared to the manual transfer of physical money to the recipient, crypto payments can be made over the internet via the rapid technology, which allows you to make payments within minutes or hours, as compared to days or even a week for the fiat currency. These pros of the virtual currencies make it one of the best candidates to replace or become an alternative to the regular fiat currency. These benefits can be utilized by both the sender and the recipient of a payment or transaction as both would be saving their precious resources, such as time and money.

259,BTC Approaching $1 Trillion Market Cap  Market Analysts Bullish,abcmoney,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 08:02:31,"Highlights   The market has witnessed a great increase in the value of BTC in the recent months, which can be seen from an all-time high of $50,000 which BTC has surpassed a few days ago.   Some optimistic market analysts are quite optimistic about BTC and co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek [] Load More One of these reasons is the institutional and mainstream adoption of the BTC. The largest number of institutional and retail investors have been seen entering the crypto market and adopting great amounts of Bitcoin, converting their billions of dollars worth of cash reserves into BTC. Some of the most prominent global companies have also been seen showing great degree of interest in Bitcoin. For example, Square bought a large quota of BTC last year, as well as Tesla, which bought nearly $1.5 worth of BTC. The richest man in the world, Elon Musk, owner of Tesla along with Jack Dorsey, the owner of Square, both have shown interest and positive expectations in Bitcoin. Also, the global pandemic of coronavirus has greatly affected all the individual economies as well as the global economy, pushing the central banks and governments to ease their monetary policies i.e. a reduction in interest rates and purchasing assets via the program of quantitative easing  which is an effort to provide relief for the devastating effects of the pandemic on the economies. One other factor, and a very important one which saw a great rush towards bitcoin as a financial asset for all the individual citizens, corporations and financial institutions, was the over printing and circulation of fiat in the country as an immediate consequence of the pandemic. When a greater number of money is printed and distributed by the central bank in a country, the supply of the currency increases, decreasing its demand and thereafter the value of the currency, the consequence is increased inflation and therefore people during this time rushed towards financial investments to save their purchasing power, anticipating inflation. Due to the recent positive performance of BTC, it seemed to be a common choice among people to purchase and invest their money in. The limited overall supply of the BTC, which is a total of 21 million coins, can also be considered to be the reason behind the bullish forecast of the market analysts as they forecast a million-dollar worth of Bitcoin (per coin price) in the future. Decentralized nature of the crypto could be another reason. We all know that bitcoin is decentralized, that is free of a third-party intervention, e.g. a regulatory bodys intervention. The BTC network, instead, is formed of mining blocks which are mined by individuals known as miners. These miners work and execute this process of BTC mining on a range of high-performance computer systems. Due to the fact that these miners are high in number, the BTC network is not controlled by a single person or authority, and since the systems on which BTC mining is performed are quite powerful, people who support the phenomenon of BTC claim the BTC networkto be among the sturdiest global networks. Conclusion There are of course some skeptics in the market who believe that this bullish run of BTC is for a shorter run, and will sooner or later succumb. However, others in the market firmly believe and rely on the long term success of BTC. Some market experts and analysts go as far as saying that the BTC will eventually become the global reserve currency of this internet and digital era.",https://www.abcmoney.co.uk/2021/04/09/btc-approaching-1-trillion-market-cap-market-analysts-bullish/

261,Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Continues to Pummel $60k,menafn,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 05:52:56,"Key Talking Points:   BTC /USD struggles to break above $60,000   Ascending triangle pattern suggests further upside   Has the recent surge become over-exhausted?   Advertisement Bitcoin hasn't really been doing much of its common spectacular performance in recent weeks as the cryptocurrency has been struggling to pus (MENAFN - DailyFX)  Key Talking Points: BTC /USD struggles to break above $60,000 Ascending triangle pattern suggests further upside Has the recent surge become over-exhausted? Advertisement Bitcoin hasn't really been doing much of its common spectacular performance in recent weeks as the cryptocurrency has been struggling to push beyond the 60,000 dollar mark. The overall sentiment is still strongly bullish for BTC/USD but it has been confined to a tight range between 55,000 and 60,000 since the end of March after it faced a strong selloff. The thing with Bitcoin is that it is not a speculative bubble by definition, given how bubbles get to an unsustainable level and then they burst without the possibility of reinflating, something that Bitcoin has done on many occasions. And although there is definitively a speculative nature behind them, cryptocurrencies seem to have some sort of store of value, which is not intrinsic in nature and falls solely in the eye of the beholder, which makes it the more volatile. If we look at the technical angle, the picture is pretty bullish, especially after a lack of strong momentum has reset overbought conditions and has allowed new buyers to enter the market. The issue with overcoming the $60,000 area is that it is a strong psychological level, and many investors are likely wondering whether Bitcoin's price has gone too far. If we look at its performance in the last 4 months, BTC/USD has risen by more than 38,000 dollars, which is equivalent to around 200%. Take the previous 4 months and it 'only managed to rise about 65% or 7,800 dollars. If we decide to look at the cryptocurrency's previous buying frenzy back in 2018, price rose 15,000 dollars in 4 months, which was equivalent to 350% at that time. So yes, Bitcoin is known for sudden outbursts of over-valuation, but you can't really compare a 300% move when price was at $4,000 with a 200% move when price was at $20,000. At some point, the recent rally has to become over-exhausted and new buyers won't be attracted as they deem the price too expensive. The main question is, is this that time? The daily chart suggests not. The formation of an ascending triangle is hinting at further upside potential, and given how the pattern is near culmination, the move higher could come as soon as next week. If so, look for strong psychological levels with Bitcoin, so $65,000 could easily be the next target, although buyers will need to push above resistance at the all-time high level of $61,773. How to Read a Candlestick Chart If BTC/USD fails to break above the triangle there will likely be a good opportunity to bring on a good retracement towards more manageable levels at which point new buyers will likely bring the price back up again. $55,960 is the immediate support level followed by the $55,000 mark. A good level to consider coming into the market as a new buyer would be anywhere between $45,900 and $41,900.

The possibility is now a reality thanks to a partnership between a domestic crypto exchange and an airline platform. Platform Allocated Euros in an Account on the Crypto Exchange to Arrange Payments According to El Mundo Financiero Criptan, based in Valencia, Spain, signed an agreement with Wings to Claim a Spanish legal association that owns a platform specialized in handling travel-related incidents and now could compensate travelers cryptos instead of euros. The platform allocated euros within an account using the crypto exchange Criptan. If any customer entitled to compensation wants to receive money in cryptos, the exchange will reimburse the money in coins such as bitcoin ( BTC ). Among the reasons behind incorporating cryptos into Wings to Claim, the platform argued that they didnt want to lag behind the growing trend of crypto adoption among the tourism and hotel sector. Carlos Corbaln, CEO of Wings to Claim, commented: In the last year, it has been observed how the current situation due to Covid-19 has generated the loss of fear of technology within the financial system, and in this sense, the trend in obtaining cryptocurrencies is constantly growing. With digital assets, you do not need intermediaries. It is safe as a means of payment. It provides great advantages to the national and international user, such as avoiding currency exchange. And it is that our main objective is the adaptation to the client together with the immediacy and security throughout the whole process. Both Companies Are Working on Other Projects Related to the Crypto Sphere But both companies still have more crypto-related plans down the pipeline, as they expect to work together in creating crypto payments solutions to allow travelers to pay for travel tickets. The travel industry is no stranger to the world of crypto. In fact, its becoming more friendly with crypto solutions.

Over a 24-hour period, Bitcoin Gold (BTG) was the largest gainer, rising 23.64% to $115.76. Other coins that showed high appreciation include Enjin Coin (ENJ), which rose 17.62% to $3.16, and PancakeSwap (CAKE), which rose 17.04% to $20.48. Stacks (STX) was up 17.02%% to $1.97. Robinhood said Thursday that in Q2 2021, 9.5 million customers traded cryptocurrencies on its platform compared to 1.7 million in Q4 2020. This represents a near six-fold rise. Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken meanwhile is considering going public via direct listing next year after witnessing record trading volumes amid surging prices of BTC, CNBC reported The first quarter just completely blew away the entirety of last year. We beat last years numbers by the end of February. The whole market has really just exploded, said Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken. Why It Matters: Spot trading volumes on Kraken in the first quarter rose 1.5 times higher than in all of last year, touching a record level of $160 billion, according to CNBC. See Also: This month, Bloomberg Intelligence noted that the technical outlook for BTC in 2021 remains strongly upward. The cryptocurrency could approach $400,000 levels, according to a reportby Bloomberg Intelligence. Altcoins too have been enjoying their day in the sun with STX being buoyant in recent days as holders become more comfortable locking their coins to earn BTC. Jason Lau, Chief Operating Officer at OkCoin told Benzinga that Stackers have been earning up to 25% APYpaid out in BTC over the past couple months, and the amount stacked has increased 3x since stacking went live.

266,Bitcoin Holds Support; $60K Resistance Within Reach,nasdaq,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 00:00:00,"Buyers defended support around $55,000 this week with bitcoin (BTC) currently trading around $58,500. There is strong resistance around $60,000, which has been tested multiple times since March. The oversold reading on the four-hour relative strength index (RSI) on April 7 preceded a near 5% rise in BTC. The last oversold reading on March 25 preceded a near 19% price rally. BTC is attempting to break above a series of lower price highs since April 1, which suggests buyers are gaining strength as sellers retreat. Intraday support is around $56,934. And the four-hour RSI is not yet overbought, which indicates further upside over the short-term. However, BTCs uptrend on daily and weekly charts is slowing. A decisive break above $60,000 is needed to support the long-term uptrend. But for now, traders have adhered to narrow price zones with lower volume as BTC consolidates.

268,Bitcoins Real Price: Is Crypto Mining Consuming Our Planet?,yahoo,"Apr 08, 2021",2021-04-08 21:00:00,"Concerns about the impact of proof of work (POW) and bitcoin (BTC) mining on the environment are growing. As interest in cryptocurrencies expands, there is... NG=F Concerns about the impact of proof-of-work (PoW) and bitcoin (BTC) mining on the environment are growing. As interest in cryptocurrencies expands, there is an increase in energy consumption. The energy consumption of the Bitcoin network made waves at the end of 2017. Even mainstream news outletswere reporting that it uses more electricity than the entire country of Ireland. At the time, the network consumed an estimated consume over 30 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year. This is less than its current consumption of 95.45 TWh according to Digiconomist. The index explains that the yearly impact of bitcoin is 45.34 metric tons (mt) of CO2. This is comparable to Hong Kong. The coins 10.97 kt of e-waste is similar to that of Luxembourg. However, a 2020 study speculates that they may be underestimated.Rather, the researchers estimate bitcoin energy consumption accounts for close to half of the current global data center electricity use. In China, researchers found that mining could even The environmental impact of mining hardware In addition to the consumption of electricity, mining hardware is a contributor to the global e-waste problem. Bitcoin mining began using simple GPU and CPUs. As the need for power grew, producers began creating unique chips. Now, bulk mining uses Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). They are specifically for mining cryptocurrencies on the PoW algorithm. Cryptocurrency mining is a highly competitive space. Only the most efficient machines operate at a profit. Mining ASICs are being constantly improved. As a result, each new generation introduced to the market means older machines become unprofitable. The set number of coins and blocks motivates this constant improvement. As more efficient machines join the blockchain the total hashrate of the blockchain also increases. The quantity of bitcoins that any given miner obtains is largely dependent on the portion of the hashrate generated. This makes older machines generate less profit while still consuming the same amount of power. Story continues As a consequence, bitcoin miners buy an incredible quantity of computing devices. Which they cannot repurpose after they lose their edge. Renewable energy usage in mining As explained, crypto mining consumes a lot of energy. This is because bitcoin mining computers need electricity to run. While this could have been a handful of miners at one point, the mining industry has grown with warehouses filled with machines constantly working. As a result, if this system ran solely on electricity fuelled by fossil fuels it would be clear that it is detrimental to our diminishing resources. However, exactly how much mining uses old-school electricity sources or renewable energy is up for debate. A 2019 mining whitepaper by crypto research firm CoinShares found that 74.1% of bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy. This is their conservative estimate. This is forward-thinking energy consumption is reflected in some mining operations. BitRiver, a colocation service for Bitcoin mining in Russia and the CIS countries, confirms that its plant only uses renewable energy. We use only renewable energy for our entire operation, which is currently utilizing over 70MW of power to mine crypto. As the demand from new and existing customers continues to increase, we are expanding our facility to utilize more of the total capacity of 100MW that our site has, Bitriver COO, Dmitrii Ushakov tells BeinCrypto. Small solutions for big problems In addition to using renewable energy, some firms are attempting to lower the environmental cost of their operations. Ushakov explains that his firm tries to help customers redistribute their hardware rather than throw it out. They help them sell the rigs on the resale. Often those interested are miners who have access to cheaper electricity so they can still run a profit. At the moment there is huge equipment demand from mining farms who get electricity at a very low rate. Depending on your electricity cost, which for some areas might be close to free, operating older second-hand mining machines is advantageous cost-wise. And after that, the equipment can be recycled like any other computer parts. Fans are reusable, and the housing could be repurposed, a representative from blockchain hardware and software firm Bitmain explains. However, this resale and recycle stance only postpones creating a great quantity of e-waste, rather than providing an actual solution to the problem. Redistributing waste by-products Another way bitcoin miners are trying to offset their energy consumption is by using wasteful by-products. Partnering with other industries to use these resources to run their mining operations. Bitcoin mining produces a lot of heat. According to the representative from Bitmain, the company uses this heat to keep rooms in their buildings normal in colder regions. In another example, other miners are partnering with energy companies to utilize by-products to run their operations. In 2020, Crusoe Energy Solutions entered a deal with energy company Equinor to use the excess natural gas from its North Dakota oil field to mine bitcoin. This gives Equinor an incentive not to simply flare the gas, which is harmful for the environment, and channel it into useful production. But, are renewables enough? While the answer to bitcoins energy problem seems like renewable energy, some believe it may not be enough. A PwC blockchain specialist, Alex de Vries, outlines in his 2019 report on bitcoins sustainability that even apparently green mining operations still contribute to environmental harm. He explains that often renewable resources, such as hydropower, are seasonal and so cannot produce the year-round energy required by miners. Unlike the power demand of Bitcoin mining machines, which is consistent all year long, the production of hydropower is subject to seasonality. As a result, seasonal variability in hydropower is already higher than 30% and expected to increase further because of climate change, he says in the report. As a result, the need to mitigate these issues and continue mining sees a continued reliance on non-renewable coal and nuclear power. Is mining worth it? Its a question of balance It is hard to determine the extent of the damage crypto mining has on the environment. However, this doesnt mean it shouldnt be a concern of the crypto community. Many consider bitcoin to be the key to a future that safeguards rights to freedom of speech, financial freedom and a democratized technology. While it is a contributing to energy consumption, it is often called out among multiple industries that contribute the same or even more. Gerry McGovern speaks about the masses of data currently consuming energy through wasteful storage in his 2020 book, World Wide Waste Giving examples of how many trees we would need to plant to offset data transactions. According to McGovern, statistics show that it would take 1.6 billion trees to offset the pollut",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-real-price-crypto-mining-210000646.html

Bears thought they had a fantastic short opportunity (which it was) when Bitcoin dropped below the rising wedge. Bulls thought they had a fantastic opportunity when Bitcoin moved back into the rising wedge. Bulls then felt trapped when price dropped, again, below the rising wedge. Now the shorts are feeling the frustration because the drop below the rising wedge for the second time has not resulted in a continued sell off. Instead, were seeing Bitcoin maintain a value in the mid to high 50k value area. The current daily candlestick shows Bitcoin is trading inbetween the daily Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen. Personally, Im going to continue to add to Bitcoin as normally do (dollar cost averaging)  but I see to many strong support and resistance levels ahead to entertain any trading at this level. I need to see a clear break higher to a new all-time high or a break and sustained move below the 50k value area. Ethereum (ETH) Above: Ethereum (ETH) Chart Ethereum had one heck of an bearish close yesterday with a massive bearish engulfing candlestick on high volume. Ethereum did recover some of the losses yesterday and was able to close just a hair above the daily Tenkan-Sen. Looking at todays candlestick we see Ethereum forming an inside bar. Inside bar patterns are some of the most sought after candlestick patterns because they provide so many trading opportunities  especially if an instrument is trading at or near a major high/low. This means we need to wait until the daily candlestick closes in order to form a trade idea  but we can make some assumptions. First, the inside bar needs to have a high below the prior candlestick high and a low higher than the prior candlestick low  in other words, all of todays price action needs to be inside of the trading range of yesterday. If this daily candlestick closes as an inside bar, a buy stop could be placed above the high of the inside bar. On the short side of the market, you would use the mother bar (bearish engulfing candlestick) to establish a sell stop below the engulfing candlestick low. But on the short side I would be careful. There is a great support level around the 1825 value area where the daily Kijun-Sen and high-volume node appear. This might be a good zone to consider adding on a dip  but watch the market carefully moving forward. Its Spring time and as we transition into Summer and as more countries begin to open, expect volume (as it naturally does in the Summer) to decrease and volatility to increase.

BTC On-Chain Analysis: CDD Shows Insignificant Selling By Long-Term Holders Read full article April 8, 2021, 7:10 PM 3 min read A look at On-Chain metrics for Bitcoin (BTC), specifically Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), to determine the long-term holders behavior. CDD suggests that long-term holders took profit near the $40,000 high of Dec. 2020. After that, they have stayed relatively dormant. Coin Days Destroyed  CDD CDD is a measure of liveliness as it pertains to transactions. Unlike simple transaction volume, it places more importance on coins that have not been spent for a long period of time. Therefore, coins held for long periods are believed to be more important than those that are not. This is because their spending signals a change in the behavior of long-term holders. The indicator is calculated in this manner: Each day that a coin remains unspent, it accumulates one coin day. Afterward, these accumulated coin days are destroyed when the coin is spent, hence the name Coin Days Destroyed. For example, one BTC that is not spent for 100 days has accumulated 100 coin days. Similarly, 0.5 BTC that is not spent for 200 days also accumulated 100 coin days. A look at CDD throughout the price history of BTC shows two distinct peaks. Dec. 4, 2018  397 million CDD Jul 29, 2019  261 million CDD The Dec. 4 peak seems to be more akin to capitulation since the BTC price was trading at $4000 at the time. On the other hand, the Jul. 29 peak seems to be holders taking profit after a significant upward movement that took BTC to $9500. Chart By Glassnode 2020 CDD A closer look at the indicators since the upward movement began in 2020 shows that even the current CDD is relatively low. Three distinct peaks were reached at the end of Dec. 2020 beginning of Jan. 2021, with highs of 60, 55, and 53 million CDD. However, it has decreased afterward. This is interesting since it shows that long-term hollers took profit near the $40,000 top but have been holding since. The $61,000 all-time high was not combined with profit taking by long-term holders.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/btc-chain-analysis-cdd-shows-171031919.html

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has unveiled why he believes that Ethereum (ETH) will surpass the flagship digital currency Bitcoin. According to Cuban, ETH will surely exceed BTC not today but in the future. Moreover, Cuban even disclosed that he holds more ETH than BTC. Meanwhile, before, Cuban was so doubtful about how crypto will sustain. Instead, he admired Decentralized Finance (DeFi) created via the Ethereum network. In addition, Cuban even said that he believes Ethereums 2.0 network upgrade will boost application development on the Ethereum blockchain. This will strengthen ETH to easily overshadow BTC successfully. Cuban said, I think the application leveraging smart contracts and extensions on ethereum will dwarf bitcoin. Bitcoin, right now, has evolved to be primarily a store value, and its very difficult to use it for anything else You really have to work a lot harder on bitcoin than you do on ethereum. In fact, Cuban wants to see the launch of ETH 2.0 in 2022. Furthermore, he notably said, the ETH 2.0 will increase Ethereum use cases. When this happens, it will attract crypto lovers to use Ethereum as a store of value. In addition, Cuban talked about the present crypto craze of non-fungible tokens (NFT) aside from ETH and BTC.

277,The NFT Gold Rush: Here's Why Everyone Is Talking About Non-Fungible Tokens,entrepreneur,"Apr 08, 2021",2021-04-08 11:00:00,"Bitcoin remains the undisputed blockchain industry leader, but as the major banks and investment funds accumulate BTC, retail investors always try to find the next big thing. 5 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. The crypto market moves in waves. Bitcoinremains the undisputed blockchainindustry leader, but as the major banks and investment fundsaccumulate BTC, retail investors always try to find the next big thing that would be able to repeat the unparalleled success of the original cryptocurrency First it was altcoins, then it was ICOs (which was another name for altcoins), in 2020 it was DeFi (which was yet another name for altcoins). NFTs can already be declared the most popular crypto trend of 2021. But unlike the previous fads, NFTs are not just rebranded altcoins - they have a unique use case, and they might stay here for longer. What are NFTs? One of the reasons for the rapid rise of the popularity of NFTs is that its very easy for everyone to immediately get what theyre all about. Imagine collectibles like baseballcards, or works of art like paintings, only stored in the form of tokens on a blockchain. Thats what NFTs essentially are: digital collectibles kept on a decentralized ledger. Related: What Is anNFT? Inside The Next Billion-Dollar Crypto Sensation. The word NFT is an abbreviation of Non-Fungible Token. Typical cryptocurrency tokens, like the thousands of altcoins launched on the Ethereumnetwork, are all fungible. This simply means that 1 XYZ token in your wallet is worth exactly the same as 1 XYZ in anyone elses wallet. Its the same with traditional currencies like euro or dollar: 1 USD in your bank account has the same value as 1 USD in somebodys pocket. The word non-fungible means that all NFTs are unique, and each of them has a different, individual value. Simply put, NFTs are collectibles very similar in nature to traditional baseball trading cards. A common card can be worthless, but a very rare card can be worth millions. The History of NFTs NFTs are by no means a new thing. The first NFT project called CryptoPunks was launched in 2017. Originally, 10,000-pixel art characters named CryptoPunks were created, and anyone with an Ethereum wallet could claim one for themselves for free - back then, NFTs werent considered a business opportunity but a silly novelty only intended to make crypto a little bit more popular. The first NFT project which gained wider recognition was CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties werent really that much different from CryptoPunks - the only difference was that instead of collecting pixel art punks, the users collected digital pets. For a few years, projects like CryptoKitties were only enjoyed by a small number of Ethereum enthusiasts. NFTs werent really considered an investment back then.They were just fun collectibles that utilized the new, exciting blockchain technology. The NFT Revolution finance ) solutions. DeFi developers reinvented Non-Fungible Tokens, and soon started to find new applications for what was once considered a mere novelty. The NFT projects of today are much more advanced than the original CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties. Thanks to smart contracts technology, almost anything can be tokenized and stored on the blockchain, and NFTs that are created now can be very complex. Related: Tampa Bay Buc Rob Gronkowski Is Launching His OwnNFT A good example is the NFT virtual painting of the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin entitled EthBoy, which sold for 260 ETH (almost $500,000 with todays prices). EthBoy is much more than just an image stored on the blockchain - it is a fully interactive work of art that changes its appearance every day based on external data such as the ETH price and Ethereum gas fees. The Future of NFTs The groundbreaking moment in the history of NFTs happened when Twitterfounder Jack Dorseysold the NFT of the first tweet he ever made for $2.9 million. Suddenly, everyone realized that theres moneyto be made with Non-Fungible Tokens, and celebrities like Lil Pump, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton started selling their own NFTs. Even Elon Musk tweeted about selling an NFT, but he eventually turned down all the offers. Perhaps even more important than individual celebrities selling NFTs is the fact that many reputed companies are now launching their licensed NFT projects. The two best examples are NBA Top Shot and Sorare, which allow people to trade virtual baseball and football cards respectively. Related: 3 Tips for Creatives Looking to Break Into theNFTIndustry The NFTs are getting more advanced and complex. Currently, many companies are working on utilizing NFTs to create blockchain-based video games, which could make Non-Fungible Tokens even more popular. Unlike the ICO craze of 2018, the NFT phenomenon is built on unique technologic fundamentals. Who knows, maybe in the future owning an NFT project will become as common as owning a website?

On the other hand, Lithuania will propose that NATO Allies offer a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Ukraine. Added to this, Ukraine is in a race to get Turkish drones. However, Ukraine has bought six drones already, with 48 being assembled. Also, it plans joint production in Ukraine itself. This makes 2021 a different case from 2014, with some reasoning this is just Putins form of diplomacy with Biden. Russians were quite bored of Putin. However, he has ruled over two decades and has not done a good job. This is because he has been antagonistic with his neighbors. For instance, this makes Russians exit with many emigrating while few have been exiled. In Spite of people contributing a lot to science and the arts, but for a few reasons their central government seems to be a lot more interested in spending money on raising tensions with European Ukraine.

Youll remember that Trump said I just wish her well, frankly, of accused child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, who is alleged to have hundreds of victims. So its odd that Gaetz is the only alleged sex trafficker who Trump doesnt wish well.Maybe if Matt Gaetz were a fascist dictator, Donald Trump would be nicer to him?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

286,Bitcoin's price is down 8% from February's highs. Is it time to buy the dip?,fool,"Apr 08, 2021",2021-04-08 05:56:39,"With the Bitcoin price down 8% from February's highs is it time to buy the dip? We look at the risks and opportunities of timing the market. BTC Image source: Getty Images The Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC)price is down 2.3% over the past 24 hours. One Bitcoin is currently worth US$56,612 (AU$74,489). Bitcoin is still but has now retraced 8% from the US$61,556 it reached on 14 February, according to data from CoinDesk. Which has crypto enthusiasts and newbies alike wondering, is it time to buy the dip? Timing your entry For an answer to that question, we turn to Simon Peters who is a market analyst at eToro. The online trading and brokerage company bought Bitcoin for its own balance sheet. This happened more than 10 years ago when it was worth $5. Now only the most bearish crypto analysts forecast the Bitcoin price will return to those bargain-basement levels. But the notoriously volatile digital token could certainly go lower from here. Asked whether ASX investors should wait for a potentially bigger price fall before buying Bitcoin, Peters told the Motley Fool: Timing the dip of any asset is both risky and difficult, as the price could fall further than the point where you think the bottom is. Ideally, the investor would need to have some knowledge of reading charts and using technical indicators to identify the bottom, or very close to the bottom of a dip or retracement. Long-term investors, those planning to buy and hold, may find it easier to dollar cost average. Buying with a fixed amount each week or month, for example, regardless of what the price is. This strategy may not yield the highest returns versus buying at the bottom of a dip, it removes the complication of trying to time the market. Can Bitcoin shine amid renewed inflation concerns? Crack open the financial news and youll almost certainly run across several articles highlighting the potential risks of resurgent inflation to share markets. Youll likely also find at least 1 article from a prominent central banker attempting to allay those fears. We dont have a crystal ball. But the broad consensus is that whether inflation begins to impact interest rates and share markets this year or next, we can expect the erosion in the value of our fiat currencies to return. But how about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? Can Bitcoin serve as an effective inflation hedge? Heres what eToros Peters told us: Bitcoin has fulfilled the criteria of an inflation hedge, which is an asset that protects against the decreasing purchasing power of a domestic currency. More people are viewing it as such. This first happened with individual investors. Now we are starting to see corporations hold Bitcoin in their treasuries as an inflation hedge instead of cash. Peters said he expects more investors will turn to Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Especially if global governments and central banks continue their easy monetary and fiscal policy measures. That in turn, he said, should see the Bitcoin price keep rising. What could send the price lower? With the Bitcoin price up 670% in the past 12 months, and more institutions lending their support for the crypto asset, what tailwinds could drag Bitcoin lower? According to Peters, there are a number of risk factors Bitcoin investors or speculators should be aware of: Firstly, we could see government or regulatory intervention, making it harder or illegal to transact, hold, or mine Bitcoin. Secondly, a flaw or vulnerability in the underlying blockchain could get exploited. For example, a 51% attack where miners collude to control the majority of hash rate on the network. Whilst this is very difficult to execute, it is not theoretically impossible. Lastly, we could see price manipulation. Bitcoin is arguably not as liquid as other assets like stocks, meaning significant orders (sometimes referred to as whales) can severely affect its price. He noted that any of these issues could see investors lose confidence in the worlds biggest crypto and send the price lower. The case for holding Bitcoin Peters reminded us that its been just over a year, 11 March 2020, since Black Thursday. That was the day a technical failure on the Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (Bitmex) saw futures crash more than 50%. And the Bitcoin price crashed below US$4,000. Since then, he told the Motley Fool, Bitcoin has gone from strength to strength. The case for holding bitcoin has increased over the period, with institutional investors now holding the crypto asset, as they look to alternatives to fiat currencies. With big corporations also lending their support, the future has never looked brighter for crypto assets. Teslas decision to both accept payment for its cars in bitcoin and hold that bitcoin on its balance sheet rather than convert it to dollars will likely build more momentum for the crypto asset. Tesla and other companies are showing that crypto is here to stay, and its mainstream adoption is only going to increase. With a finite supply of Bitcoin, Peters said increased institutional interest in the digital token could cause a supply-side squeeze and see prices continue to rise longer-term.

288,Bitcoin's price is not the only number going up [Video],fxstreet,"Apr 08, 2021",2021-04-08 05:24:50,"As Bitcoin (BTC) set another new all-time high earlier this month at over $61K, its price has gotten many people talking. With large players entering | 4/8/2021 5:24:50 AM GMT As Bitcoin (BTC) set another new all-time high earlier this month at over $61K, its price has gotten many people talking. With large players entering the market every other day from Visa and Mastercardto Tesla, BNY Mellon, Morgan Stanley, and Meitu, institutional adoption has been firmly confirmed. Add to that unprecedented monetary dilution to fund fiscal stimuli that's eroding the value of fiat currencies and we have the perfect storm for BTC price to take off in earnest. But that's not the only number going up. Bitcoin hash rate registered its highest ever As BTC price (at the time of writing) looks to be recoiling to surpass the $60K barrier once more after the Federal Reserve announced it would likely keep its monetary policyloose with interest ratesclose to zero until at least 2023, BTC hash rate is also hovering near its all-time high of over 160 million TH/s, according to Blockchain.com. This is a very bullish sign as it shows that miners are betting on Bitcoin, adding more power and investing in more mining equipment to add hash rate to the network. Hashrate also reflects the security of the Bitcoin network; the more computing power behind it, the more resistant to attacks or manipulation from large attackers like nation states. While Bitcoin has never suffered a double-spend attack of any kind, it's not an impossibility. However, with so much computing power behind it now, that looks increasingly unlikely. In fact, Bitcoin has been strong enough to resist such an attack for a long time now. Who doesn't remember that famous response to a journalist by Andreas Antonopoulos back in 2015? He said that Bitcoin had already reached a level of computing power whereby to attack it would require a massive covert operation of chip fabrication and a coordinated assault that would only give the perpetrator dominance over a block for 10 minutes before they were discovered and kicked off the network. That was almost six years ago. Bitcoin miners are earning more than ever Despite the Bitcoin Halving in May 2020, that slashed the block reward in half reducing the profits for miners, thanks to the epic rise in BTC price along with increasing transaction fees, Bitcoin miners are earning more than ever  close to 1 BTC per block in March 2021 - making it a new all-time high. This is an excellent sign for the Bitcoin network and an added incentive for more miners to compete for block rewards and add their hashing power, making Bitcoin even more robust and secure. Rising transaction fees Rising transaction fees on the Bitcoin network can be something of a double-edged sword. Rising fees mean that users have to pay more when transacting with the Bitcoin network, however, comparative to the volume of funds being transferred, an average fee of $22.7 per transaction is often a drop in the bucket. Furthermore, thanks to network upgrades such as Segregated Witness (SegWit) and layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network, transaction fees have been greatly reduced. According to data from BitInfoCharts, the average transaction fee remains much lower than at its heights in December 2017 at $50. High transaction fees on the Bitcoin network can even be seen as a good thing as it shows that network adoption is growing  and TX fees contribute to miner revenue as well. Moreover, users wishing to transact in smaller amounts can make use of layer 2 solutions like Lightning and Liquid. A rising number of Bitcoin addresses It's not only price, hash rate, miner revenue, and transaction fees that are going up. The number of unique Bitcoin addresses is also going up. Data shows that despite the bear market that followed Bitcoin's 2017 bull market high, addresses went steadily up and are now almost reaching new all-time highs again. While the number of addresses isn't entirely synonymous with the number of users (one user can create as many addresses as he or she wishes), services such as exchanges may use just one address to hold thousands of users' funds. Conclusion Bitcoin's price is not the only thing going up. In fact, this March also saw open interest on BTC futures hit a record high at $22.5 billion. All these trends are bullish for the number-one cryptocurrency that has shown that, regardless of the price peaks and corrections, the network continues to grow as HODLers, miners, and traders are in it for the long haul.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021 John Rotonti: You have Bitcoin miners which are verifying the transaction so my follow-up is, how do you mine Bitcoin, what is happening? Bernd Schmid: That's great. Yeah. Miners are essentially the integral part of this network of computers, so they're part of this network. How it works, is a miner, they earn money, essentially they earn Bitcoin by validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. But how it works is you or I, whoever wants to create the transactions, we're sending this essentially to this network. The miners are collecting all these new transactions and then they are trying to create this new block. This trying to create a new block is actually quite a difficult thing. Essentially what you need to do to create this new block, a valid block. You need to solve a puzzle, a mathematical puzzle, and the miners are specialized to solve this puzzle essentially. You're creating all these new transactions, let's say it's 1,000 transactions. You're trying to solve this mathematical puzzle, which is very specific and once you have solved it, you can say, ""Oh, great, I've got the solution here."" The solution, you are sending it to the network and then all the other miners they can validate, like is the solution the correct one. This validation process, it's very easy. If you can see in an instant, by a simple calculation whether this solution that this miner claims to have found, is the correct one for the transaction you wanted to validate or not. If everybody essentially agrees, yes, this is the correct solution then this block is added to the blockchain, you have extended the blockchain and the miner who has successfully solved this puzzle. Will get the reward, which has new Bitcoins being created. Currently, exactly 6.25 Bitcoin. Rotonti: Question that just came to my mind. You may or may not know the answer to this. Are there public companies that are Bitcoin miners? Can I buy stock in a Bitcoin miner? Schmid: Theoretically, you could actually do it yourself. You can buy a piece of hardware, you can even run it on your laptop. This actually worked up until a couple of years. Ten years ago, Bitcoin was still in the beginning. It was created around 2009, I think beginning 2009 if I'm not mistaken. It was still very easy to solve this puzzle. But what essentially happens, the difficulty of this puzzle-solving algorithm or the difficulty of the puzzle, it's adjusted based on how many people want to try to solve this puzzle. Of course, since you get that, I mentioned that you get six Bitcoin or 6.25 Bitcoin, which right now has a value of more than $300,000. You can imagine that everybody would like to have this and solve the puzzle. Of course, people try to extend the hardware. You buy as much hardware as you can afford and think it's still economic to do that, and this is essentially what is happening. So yes, there are actually public companies, they're buying a lot of hardware and they're participating in this mining process. I have to admit I don't remember the name. I know there's a Canadian company. You can look it up, which is a pure Bitcoin mining company. You can buy shares in it. Bernd Schmid has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021 John Rotonti: So Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed recently. I think it's somewhere around $60,000 U.S. per coin. Is it too late for investors to get in? Bernd Schmid: I don't think so. I personally don't buy it anymore. It always depends when you get in. I look at it from a portfolio perspective. But I think how I look at it, what could happen to Bitcoin with short term or in the longer term, the one thing I mentioned before, is the $1 trillion market cap compared to what Bitcoin might be in the future. I think a very likely use case is Bitcoin could be the digital gold. Then it could still 7X from today until whenever this might happen, or it could, like I mentioned, if it replaces more than just gold, the value could theoretically be even higher. I think it's the best way to get at least the gauge of could this thing be worth. It's certainly not too late, but, and this is what I want to mention, based on historical cycles, there's about a four-year cycle, which Bitcoin has, and Bitcoin has actually dropped every four years by about 80-90%. Rotonti: Where are we in that cycle? Do you know where we are in that cycle? Year two, year three? Schmid: Yes. Actually, the pool part of the cycle is quite short. I think it's about a year, don't fix like I'm not 100% sure. But we are like in the middle of same, in the beginning to middle. Actually, I have a chart what I did and actually PlanB, but I mentioned before he does as well. I did it myself. I chartered the last two cycles and the average of the last two cycles. Right now and the last two cycles you have from the start of the cycle about a 30X to 50X in terms of price movement. So from whatever, from $100 to $5,000 or last time, I think the top was about $20,000. This cycle started with around between five and $10,000. So if you count the 20x, you would be somewhere between $100,000 $200,000, that's where this can go into the cycle. Even when we talked about this cycle, I personally, if you think the top will we reached in the same timeframe like last two cycles, shifted, it will be reached about mid-to-end or begin mid-end. Two to three times increase of Bitcoin until the top is being reached in a couple of months. But then be aware, you never know what's going to go. You don't know if the top is, maybe even sooner, and there might likely, I think there will be a drop by 80% at some point of time I think. I still believe. Rotonti: That's fascinating Bernd and I love how you scale it by comparing it to real gold. Because if this is the digital gold and it's currently got a $1 trillion market cap. I think you said so far we've mined about $7 to $10 trillion worth of gold, right? so if there's a potential 7-10x run from here, potentially. Schmid: You know, if you look at it from a value investor's perspective, you actually know that's tough, actually. It never only goes to the value of actually has it always overshoot and undershoot. So it's quite likely that you go even beyond that. You just never know when all these things are going to happen. But one thing is certain, that are relatively certain is that we will have very high volatility. You might be down 50% in a short amount of time. You have to start like these kind of things and consider it if you invest into it. Bernd Schmid has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021 Aaron Bush: I kind of want to touch on maybe some areas where people would have questions or might have doubts. Some people say Bitcoin is like digital gold. Well, I don't think gold is interesting as an investment. Or some people say, ""Bitcoin as a currency isn't as good as the dollar, why would I be interested?"" People have concerns about the energy usage and things like that. To these people who have these various forms of skepticism, what would you tell them to add a different perspective to help them think past why those issues aren't a huge deal? Dan Morehead: Yeah. I've heard those arguments for a long time and the paper currency one is the easiest one to swat away. In the U.S., we don't always think about currency very much. We have one of the least bad paper currencies. People in Venezuela, Argentina, they totally understand currencies. Even in the U.S., the dollar's lost 90% of its purchasing power since 1950. I mean, it's been debased at a very rapid rate. You used to be able to exchange $32 bills for an ounce of gold. Now, it's $1,200 for an ounce of gold. So we just keep printing more and more money. A great example of that is the pound sterling is the oldest currency on Earth. For 850 years, it was worth one pound of sterling silver. Then they said, ""Oh, it would be better if we just print money without anything to back it up."" It now costs 184 to buy a pound of sterling silver. So the people that say, ""Oh, paper money is great, why would I invest in Bitcoins? Paper money is no bueno, it's been going down ever since they broke the gold standard or the silver peg."" Paper money has been terrible. Bitcoin has been appreciating at a rapid rate. If you take a look at U.S. dollar on a trade-related basis, since the pandemic began, it's crashing because they're printing so many of them that the value is going down at a rapid rate. Again, people say gold hasn't been a great investment. Well, in my lifetime, you could exchange U.S. dollars at $32 per ounce, and so gold has been a great investment, dollar has been terrible. Another example is the silver-colored money that used to exist, used to be made out of silver. Again, in my lifetime, quarters, dimes were made out of silver, now they're made out of cheap metals. Pennies used to be made out of copper, and now they're worth more than one cent just to melt the copper. The government's made it a felony to melt pennies. There is no intrinsic value in paper money, it's being debased all the time. Crypto, honesty, it can be very volatile. It's going to go up, it's going to go down, but 10 years from now, I think crypto is going to be worth way more than paper money. Aaron Bush owns shares of Bitcoin.

But there's one thing that everyone can agree on -- Bitcoin is a volatile asset. In this Fool Live video clip, recorded on March 18, Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel, CFP, asks Onramp Invest CEO and cryptocurrency expert Tyrone Ross about Bitcoin's volatility and what investors should keep in mind. 10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021 Matt Frankel: One of the things they're most worried about, and it's something that Bitcoin bulls are really excited about, it's the volatility. Right now, as we're speaking, Bitcoin is worth nearly 10 times what it was a year ago. Tyrone Ross: Yeah. Frankel: Being fair, that's not stable as a payment mechanism. Ross: No. Frankel: What do you say to investors, even with a high risk tolerance, who are worried about the volatility of Bitcoin? Ross: I want to address what you said. The Bitcoin blockchain is a beautiful payment mechanism. The price isn't. So you've got to separate those two. I agree with you. It shouldn't be a payment mechanism. Now, there's something called Lightning that's being built, but you shouldn't be buying things with your Bitcoin anyway, for exactly what I said. Every time you buy a coffee, that would be a taxable event, and there's other things to that. What I think is important here with the volatility is, yes, those of us that are crypto-hippies look at the volatility and say, ""Oh, it's great,"" because we can stomach it and we know better. The average person goes, ""It's down 80%."" A lot of people can't stomach a 10% drop, 5% drop, 1% drop. This thing drops 80%? A lot of people don't want to take that ride on the roller coaster. But the volatility, when you learn about Bitcoin, is a feature, not a bug, and it's one of those things where, when you look at it, it also is proof of how early we are still. It will smooth out. Last month, the 30-day volatility had jumped higher than it had been, I think, for the previous seven years. Going back to 2013, the 30-day volatility jumped up 160-plus percent. My company did some research on that. It got picked up. So the volatility has picked up. The correlation to risk assets. A year ago, when things went nuts, it went down with it, because the first thing you do is you sell risky assets, so we're still there. But every day it gets stronger and grows and it stays around and you get more institutional adoption, and there's the ability for large investors to move in size with best execution, and best price discovery. Those things are important, and we're getting there. But for the time being, yeah, the volatility for those of us that can stomach it and know, go, ""Yes, It's on sale,"" but not everybody can do that. And that will change. Frankel: So the way you look at it is the more important thing would be Bitcoin moving from say, 10% adoption to 20% adoption than moving from $20,000 to $50,000? Ross: Exactly. That's the key, and there's that volatility and adoption too. Because think about it. Go back to 2017. It's all retail, and now all the institutions are like, ""Look at these idiots."" Now, you've got the institutions coming in, and now all the retail that was in and stayed in, they're like, ""Look at these idiots."" So the volatility of who comes in; the volatility of price; the volatility of price discovery. I did a webinar with Digital Assets Research and FTSE Russell, and at any point that you can check the price of Bitcoin across some exchanges, it could be off by 2%. That's crazy. There's volatility in a lot of different things, which is new, and the best example is this; I'm not a parent, but I have three nephews. You ever watch a child learn to walk? That is very volatile. ""Oh, they're going to hit their head. Oh, they fell again."" And you know what they do? They get up, and they keep trying, and they fall. But it's a very volatile thing. It's new. Anything new, or any 12-year-old -- Bitcoin is 12 -- 12-year-olds are volatile. I say this in jest comparing a technology to a human being, but anything that's new is going to be volatile. It just is, and then it has to find its way, and I think that's what's happening in this space. Frankel: It's fair to say as adoption keeps going, it will eventually stabilize. That could be 20 years from now, but it should eventually find some kind of equilibrium. Ross: Yeah, it will. I think folks like myself, long-dated call options on a store of value, I think it will get there. I don't think it's there now, but you're betting that it'll become that in the future.

295,Social crypto-trading goes live: Interview with a Top Trader from Decoin By BTC Peers,investing,"Apr 08, 2021",2021-04-08 00:00:00,"Social crypto-trading goes live: Interview with a Top Trader from Decoin Social crypto-trading goes live: Interview with a Top Trader from Decoin Anticipating another Bitcoin price spike, the crypto network continues to expand exponentially. After the brief downturn caused by the Iranian crackdown on crypto exchanges, Bitcoin quickly regained its position and now trades at a value slightly lower than its all-time high of $61,000. Theres no doubt that the market has grown exponentially since last yearin March 2020, the asset was trading at just $5k, A fact that seems unbelievable now considering its current price tag of $58,000. Even though the asset will perhaps never go back to the point from where it all began, every top-notch trader is more eager than ever to put their hard-earned money into Bitcoin with the hope that their returns will similarly skyrocket. There indeed are a couple of reasons to be optimistic about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading. The digital payment giant, Visa (NYSE: V ), has made it clear that the USD Coin can now be used within its payment scope. This increases the odds that Bitcoin will be used as a means of payment at some point in the future. Many celebrities see the potential of BitcoinElon Musk, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, and Gwyneth Paltrow are only some of the people who have enthusiastically joined this growing global investment movement. And even though cryptocurrency is still a highly volatile asset, it provides unparalleled arbitrage opportunities due to the absence of a centralized regulatory authority setting definitive price points. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for cryptocurrency-fuelled products has increased to a degree never seen before. With travel time to and from the office having become a thing of the past, on-screen time has faced unparalleled growth. This is one reason why Decoin decided to create an innovative social trading platform that allows traders to openly interact and cultivate their best strategic approach within their community of like-minded individuals. Using its novel feature of performance-based evaluation, participants are able to easily identify the most successful traders and decide whose footsteps it makes sense to follow. I recently spoke to Crypto Bull, one of Decoins top traders, and took advantage of the opportunity to ask him for his insights on the functionality of the platform and suggestions on the optimal trading strategy that would benefit anyone starting their cryptocurrency journey. Hi, thanks for joining me for a talk. Let us begin by discussing the state of crypto-trading at the present moment. As a top trader, how would you evaluate the pace of the industrys development, and what can we anticipate from the year 2021? I am very satisfied with the growth of the industry. The cryptocurrency market cap just reached 2 trillion dollars, which is huge. The predictions anticipate that the market will reach 4 trillion dollars by the end of this year! Is there anything we can add specifically about Bitcoin? Which factor plays the most significant part in the institutional adoption of this digital asset, and how far do you think its price rally will hold up? I think that the new trend of using alternative energy to mine Bitcoin will help institutional adoption. The fact that financial institutions are joining the crypto revolution will possibly make the price skyrocket even more. I truly believe that big gains are awaiting the holders. When thinking about cryptocurrency trading, what are the techniques that first come to your mind? As an experienced trader, which strategy do you see as a more secure betshort-term trading or long-term holding? The number one rule that guides my trading is never go against the trend. Short-term trading is a better approach for uncertain periods, and holding works better during bearish times. As a professional trader, which traits do you consider essential for excelling in this field? How do you manage to stay agile and flexible in the current market environment and not give up in case of a misfortune? Never stay in the same spot. Always stay up to date on recent trends and hypes. I take part in active Telegram/Discord groups such as the Decoin channel to keep a finger on the pulse of the market. Loss is part of the game. The most important thing is knowing you made the right decision. What has been the biggest success story in your career to date? Could you share the secret of the most successful trades you have made? I spotted the DeFi trend very early and made some very successful trades within a short period of time. I made the biggest profit when buying Uniswap and AAVE. On the flip side, we are also interested in hearing about your rainy days. What was your biggest fiasco, and what lessons has it taught you? What helps you stay on the path of constant self-improvement? At the beginning of 2019, I sold most of my Etherum at around $120. I didnt sell it at the stop price that I had decided when I bought it, that was about $300. It taught me to be always disciplined and stick to the original plan, even when there are big losses. This discipline will ensure that you make the biggest gains in the future. What are the strategies one can implement when one is new to the cryptocurrency market? What are the risks associated with this activity, especially for freshers, and whats the best way to avoid them? My advice is to learn from those who have had the most proven profitable results throughout the years. In Decoin, freshers can watch recorded sessions of traders and copy these top traders actions. I think this combination can be beneficial to new traders till they gain confidence. Some cryptocurrency-backed assets are getting spots on the largest stock exchanges worldwide. Talking generally, where would you recommend people investon the stock market or a cryptocurrency exchange? Revolutions are always the best choice, in my opinion. The whole cryptocurrency market is relatively new compared to the traditional market, and the potential is huge. I would pick the cryptocurrency market, so this is my advice to those asking for it.

296,Kava announces significant performance enhancements with the release of Kava 5 By BTC Peers,investing,"Apr 08, 2021",2021-04-08 00:00:00,"Kava announces significant performance enhancements with the release of Kava 5 Kava announces significant performance enhancements with the release of Kava 5 San Francisco, April 8th 15:00 UTC - Kava announced today that it enables institutions to earn +45% APR on Bitcoin holdings without counterparty risk. The Kava baselayer infrastructure has been optimized. Kava Labs released the Kava 5.1 upgrade to the public including its borrow side functionality. Bitcoin and others have enabled users to take control of funds removing the need for banks and middle men. Now users can custody their digital assets, store value and make payments without the fees and regulators who censor financial freedom. However, with great power comes great responsibility. The old centralized way is being a recipient - you get your checking and savings accounts and you can't custody your assets. The new way is you have total control and power, but with that Kava has had a lack of participation. The community needs to own their responsibility to show up and vote. Institutional investors have been paying increasing attention to Bitcoin in recent months. The growing number of publicly traded companies having a Bitcoin treasury is just one such indicator. Kava's recent protocol upgrade lets these companies take out loans on their assets. Institutional Investors Flock To Bitcoin The past twelve months have been intriguing as far as Bitcoin is concerned. Besides the price hype, the big news is how more institutional investors seek exposure to the world's leading cryptocurrency. Rather than spending money on futures contracts, these companies purchase Bitcoin as part of their Treasury. Several companies have been outspoken about these purchases, including MicroStrategy, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), and Meitu. To some, this approach may seem risky. Bitcoin remains a volatile asset that can undergo wild price fluctuations. However, every company creating a Bitcoin Treasury over the past few months is currently in profit. The acquiring of Bitcoin and profiting from its price rise seems to be working out well, although the momentum can turn around on a dime. Now that these institutional players are invested in Bitcoin, one has to wonder what comes next. Will they sell when the price is at a specific level, or keep adding more BTC to their Treasury? Figuring out this ""retention"" angle will prove necessary if this industry is to keep on growing globally. It took years to get these companies' attention, yet there are still few reasons besides the speculative asset to ensure they hold onto their BTC portfolio for a while. Finding new use cases for these companies' Bitcoin holdings may be the missing piece of the puzzle. Institutional-Grade Borrowing One option that may appeal to some of the institutional players is using their current Bitcoin holdings as collateral for loans. As part of Kava's recent V5 upgrade, the HARD Protocol received an update to Version 2. This upgrade provides borrowing with variable interest rates and HARD tokens' distribution to suppliers and borrowers alike. Assuming companies like Tesla want to put their BTC to work, they can do so through Kava and HARD Protocol. Any financial institution can earn 45% on their current BTC holdings without counterparty risk. As Tesla owns $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin - or an estimated 48,000 BTC - they can earn up to 21,600 BTC with a 12 month lock-up period. Kava provides a significant passive income stream that institutions can explore by turning their Bitcoin into a cash-flowing asset. The option of lending and borrowing is an increasingly popular aspect of decentralized finance. To date, Bitcoin's role in DeFi remains minimal, as few protocols support the world's leading currency in its native form. More often than not, users need to convert their holdings to a tokenized or wrapped version and spend money to do so. Protocols that support Bitcoin natively can benefit from the growing interest in cryptocurrencies by institutional investors. Convincing the institutions that hold Bitcoin to explore DeFi options will be a tall order. Although a 45% return with no counterparty risk is appealing, it remains unclear how many companies prefer this option because the risk with DeFi is theres no counterparty to sue when things go wrong. Closing Thoughts As more Bitcoin-oriented DeFi solutions come to market, the landscape will grow more competitive and compelling. Catering to institutional-grade players is the next order of business, as big money is pouring into Bitcoin as of late. Keeping that momentum going will require compelling options, either through decentralized finance or otherwise. The coming months may prove crucial in this regard, as these institutional players may not sit around for too long. As more enterprises and financial institutions adopt bitcoin and crypto currencies, the more valuable the Kava DeFi platform will become as it enables this new wave of financially minded users with a way to finally put their assets to work and make Bitcoin and other crypto into a cash flowing asset on their balance sheets. - Brian Kerr, CEO of Kava Labs About Kava Kava is a multi-asset DeFi platform that offers stablecoins, loans, and other financial services for users of major cryptocurrency assets including BTC, XRP , BNB and ATOM to name a few. The Kava platform has three types of tokens, the KAVA token, HARD token and the USDX stablecoin where the KAVA token is the native token of the Kava blockchain integral in the security, governance, and mechanical functions of the platform. Users can collateralize their crypto assets in exchange for Kavas stablecoin, USDX. Kavas stablecoin provides a high interest yield earning users more than they would with a traditional cash or savings account at a bank, but unlike traditional savings accounts.

299,"Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC looking more bearish every day",fxstreet,"Apr 07, 2021",2021-04-07 22:06:45,"The recovery of the cryptocurrency market from the late-March lows lifted the complex above the $2 trillion threshold, with Bitcoin still representing Bitcoin price shaping two bearish patterns, so pick your poison. Ethereum price faltering at new highs, but bullish outlook unchanged. XRP price spikes on a tsunami of buying, but consolidation is presumable. The recovery of the cryptocurrency marketfrom the late-March lows lifted the complex above the $2 trillion threshold, with Bitcoin still representing over 50% despite the lackluster price action. The rebound has been more bountiful for ETH bulls and exceptionally so for XRP speculators. Bitcoin price continues to strikeout with rallies around $60,000 Two weeks ago, BTC appeared to be shaping an ascending wedge pattern that required at least one more marginal high and a test of the 3.618 Fibonacci extension of the 2017-2018 bear market before activating. However, over the last few days, the bellwether digital currency has defined a head-and-shoulders top pattern with the neckline passing through $54,750, just above the 100 twelve-hour simple moving average (SMA). Support begins at the March low at $50,305, followed by the February low at $43,016. A decline of that magnitude would knock the Relative Strength Index (RSI) into an oversold condition, thereby creating the necessary reset for the bull market that began in 2020. BTC/USD 12-hour chart Even if BTC does bounce from the 100 twelve-hour SMAat $54,288, as it has in March and January of this year, it doesnt dismiss the more prominent ascending wedge pattern. Bitcoin will need to overcome the upper trendline of the wedge before traders can aggressively renew their commitment. Ethereum price high not confirmed by momentum index Ethereum is struggling to hold the new all-time high price reached on April 2 as the steady consolidation has given way to some selling pressure today. The breakout from the symmetrical triangle on March 31 remains live, yet it is still possible that ETH will have a throwback to the upper trendline of the triangle. Traders need to be patient and give the smart contracts giant the opportunity to prove itself. Upside targets include the 1.382 Fibonacci extension of the February correction at $2,327, followed by the 1.618 extension level at $2,504. ETH/USD 12-hour chart For traders holding the position that ETH is faltering because BTC has not printed a new high they may be interested in knowing that Ethereum pricebroke out early this month from a double-bottom pattern versus Bitcoins price action. ETH/BTC 12-hour chart If selling pressure accelerates, ETH should find support at the rising trend line of the triangle pattern. If price is unable to reach these levels, the March low at $1,545.77 will quickly be in play. XRP price has awakened the bulls It has been an explosive couple of days for Ripple as the digital token climbed 90% over the first three days of this week and incredibly, it is the best 3-day gain since December 2017. The impulsive move in XRP, underpinned by positive developments in the SEC case against Ripple executives, has cleared the massive resistance area between $0.60 and $0.80 and tagged not only the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement of the 2018-2020 bear market but also the psychologically important $1.00. A consolidation that oscillates around $1.00 is the ideal scenario, but a test of the breakout above $0.80 is a possibility. As long as XRP stays above support, the upside momentum should continue over the longer term, pending any bearish news in the SEC case. XRP/USD daily chart If the SEC case turns sour and XRP plunges back into the $0.60-$0.80 range all bets are off for the cross-border remittances token, and traders revert to trading the range.

Yellen pushes minimum corporate taxes, no more fossil fuel breaks, to pay for infrastructure U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday fleshed out the details of a corporate tax hike plan linked to President Joe Biden's infrastructure investment proposal, aiming to raise $2.5 trillion in new revenues over 15 years by deterring tax avoidance.  Yellen's plan relies on negotiating a 21% global minimum corporate tax rate with major economies and a separate 15% minimum tax on 'booked' income aimed at the largest U.S. corporations.  Yellen said that promises of increased U.S. investment by corporations under the 2017 Republican tax cuts failed to materialize. 9h ago Swedish Central Bank Reveals First Study of Digital Currency (Bloomberg) -- The Swedes are learning that their once pioneering vision for a central bank digital currency might take a lot longer to enact than initially thought.The Riksbank just published the results of the first phase of a pilot project into what is essentially the most advanced exploration of a post-cash era to be undertaken by a major, western economy. It says the rapid pace at which cash is disappearing presents potential problems that a digital currency controlled by a central bank can address.The task is huge and Swedens central bank, the worlds oldest, keeps pushing back its timeline. After once suggesting it might be ready to move ahead with an e-krona by 2018, the Riksbank now says the current pilot project wont be completed until early next year, and has even given itself room to continue trying until the end of 2026.Other central bankers have openly dismissed the notion that theres any reward to be gained from being a first-mover in the field of digital currencies. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said the U.S. would rather be right than first.In most economies it will take time. And especially if lawmakers need to weigh in, Johanna Jeansson of Bloomberg Economics.GLOBAL INSIGHT: Carpe Diem - Central Banks in Digital Future Mithra Sundberg, who heads the Riksbank unit thats running the project from Stockholm, suggests its important not to settle on the technology before figuring out exactly what the digital currency needs to do. Thats as the Riksbank makes clear its not replacing cash, and that whatever it ends up creating -- if it moves ahead -- will probably require a new legal framework before it can be used.Meanwhile, cash in the form of bank notes and coins is slowly but surely petering out in the largest Nordic economy. Last year, Swedes used cash less often than the citizens of seven other mature markets, as a percentage of total transactions, according to the McKinsey Global Payments Report.But not everyone sees cashlessness as a trigger for embarking on a digital currency project. In neighboring Norway, another virtually cashless society, the central bank says theres no acute need to introduce a digital currency.What Bloomberg Economics Says...The motivation for introducing a central bank digital currency may change as policy makers explore the issue. Simply introducing a complement to cash for retail transactions may not make much of a difference in the economy. Using wholesale CBDCs in cross-border transactions has the potential to raise efficiency. Employing new digital tools for policy purposes could really alter the macroeconomic playing field. The bigger the step, the more thought its likely to require. Expect that to take time.-- Johanna Jeansson, Scandinavia economistSundberg says Swedens e-krona pilot project hasnt yet explored the monetary policy ramifications of such a transformation. But she and her team have looked at the technical possibilities of being able to charge interest, she says.The Riksbanks pilot project shows that it would be possible to apply interest rates on a CBDC, regardless of whether its account-based or token based. If a negative interest rate is to be applied, the end-user can hold the tokens, but not a separate key that provides access to those tokens.The compatibility of an interest-bearing ekrona, positive or negative, with a distribution model as tested in phase one, is a much broader question than the purely technical possibilities and limitations, the Riksbank said.For now, the Riksbank is focusing on a so-called two-tier model, in which it would be responsible for the issuance and redemption of a CBDC. In such a framework the so-called participants, such as banks or payment firms, would have direct contact with the end-user, according to Micael Lindgren, the technical project manager at the Riksbank.Ultimately, politicians and not central bankers will decide what the future of money will look like in Sweden. Lawmakers will judge whether the information produced through the pilot project persuades them that an e-krona is even necessary, and if so, what form it should take.(Adds comment from Bloomberg Economics)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 19h ago",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1e780af1-393f-37b5-8334-5610aa8511e1/why-marathon-digital-riot.html

303,"Intelligence dossier finds Bitcoin is outperforming gold, but Ethereum is outshining Bitcoin",cityam,"Apr 07, 2021",2021-04-07 15:38:00,"Much-anticipated intelligence report from Kraken reveals how Bitcoin is performing against gold and Ethereum is on track to hit $3,000. Wednesday 7 April 2021 4:38 pm Intelligence dossier finds Bitcoin is outperforming gold, but Ethereum is outshining Bitcoin Darren Parkin (photo by Aleksi R) Krakens highly-anticipated March Market Report has revealed the correlation between gold and Bitcoin has fallen to levels not seen since late 2016. Released within the last couple of hours, the exchanges data shows gold suffered its worst first quarter in 39 years, while Bitcoin (BTC) enjoyed its sixth consecutive month of double-digit growth  its longest monthly upward streak since 2013. Krakens intelligence manager  Pete Humiston  explained that while both gold and Bitcoin are generally considered inflation hedges, institutions may now be regarding BTC as a better store of value. In the past, market participants were reluctant to own BTC over gold because few understood its asymmetric upside and its utility as a superior store of value, he said. While neither offer yield, BTCs total addressable market extends far beyond golds $11T market cap, giving it greater utility in todays day and age where virtually every aspect of our lives is shifting from analogue to digital. Huge prospects He also claimed that many market participants may also be realising that BTC has huge prospects as an emerging inflation hedge with upside potential, utility, and relevance in both traditional financial markets and crypto markets. As more become familiar and comfortable with digital assets, we can expect BTC to capture market share from risky assets, such as junk bonds and stocks, as well as risk-off assets, like gold, he added. This rotation is already taking place. Last month, BTCs correlation with gold slumped to a 52-month low as BTC posted its third best 1Q in history and gold posted its worst 1Q in 39 years. The intelligence dossier also found that Bitcoins correlation with large cap tech stockswent negativefor the first time since January 2020 as the cryptocurrency moved up with a strengthening dollar, finishing March with its correlation to the US Dollar Index (DXY) at a one-year high. NFT volumes hit an all-time high,with aggregate daily transaction volumes across the primary NFT marketplaces hitting $34 million on March 11. Bitcoins volatility fell nearly 40 per cent month-on-monthto a three-month low with a knock-on effect on trading volumes, which fell five per cent to a year-to-date low of approximately $255 billion. Ether outperformed Bitcoinwith a 35 per cent return in March, compared to Bitcoins 30 per cent return. Like Bitcoin, Ethers market volatility and trading volumes both fell to YTD lows.  Historically, Q2 is positive for the crypto marketwith Bitcoins median quarterly returns at 39.5 per cent and Ethers at 71 per cent. Should history repeat itself, Bitcoin could finish June at $82,000 and Ether at well above $3,000.

Data circulating on social m | 4/7/2021 1:19:06 PM GMT The United States biggest crypto exchange would have made more money by simply buying and holding Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013. Data circulating on social media reveals that despite Coinbases $800-million profits in Q1, the company would still be richer had it used its seed funding cash to buy BTC. Coinbase profits lose out to 2013 hodlers Ahead of its initial public offering on April 14, Coinbase reported bumper revenue this week At $1.8 billion, Q1 outperformed the entirety of 2020. The numbers became an instant talking point as market participants weigh up the likely impact of the IPO launch. Other IPOs, including the recent Deliveroo sale, sparked sell-offs. Amid sky-high valuations and the associated buzz, however, it appears that all Coinbase had to do in order to outperform was to buy Bitcoin. Specifically, the exchanges $30-million seed funding in 2013 would be worth up to $2 billion had it been converted to BTC at the time. By contrast, Coinbases lifetime profits total to date are estimated to be somewhere between $780 million and $1.3 billion. BTC/USD 1-month candle chart (Bitstamp). Source: Tradingview Coinbase is going to list publicly in less than 10 days and reported blowout numbers today (~800m in profit on 1.8B on revenue), developer Vijay Boyapati commented. Sounds great, but imagine how much more theyd be worth if they had held their profits in #Bitcoin instead of dollars for the last 8 years. As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoins compound annual growth rate has topped 200%, and since April 2013, BTC/USD is up over 43,000%. Bitcoin supply shortage stays real Boyapati was touching on another, more controversial aspect of Coinbases business model to come to light this year. For all its success, executives have always chosen to hold a fairly modest amount of BTC. According to its recent filing with U.S. regulators, the exchange owns 4,486 BTC. By contrast, as Boyapati notes, newcomer MicroStrategy, despite not being an exchange, has bought in excess of 91,000 BTC since August last year  a stash that has doubled in U.S. dollar terms for the company to date. Its almost as if Coinbase doesnt even believe in the industry in which they are one of the biggest players. Sad, he added. Not everyone was convinced. Erik Voorhees, founder of crypto exchangeservice ShapeShift, argued that Coinbases contribution to the cryptocurrency phenomenon made it incomparable to MicroStrategy. Imagine holding MicroStrategy in higher esteem than Coinbase. The latter struggled for eight years to build the most successful Bitcoin company in the world, serving 50 million people, he responded to a tweet from Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp. The former discovered Bitcoin in 2020 and bought a bunch... from Coinbase.

308,CoinMarketCap Temporarily Removes South Korean Exchanges By CoinQuora,upnewsinfo,"Apr 07, 2021",2021-04-07 08:32:33,"CoinMarketCap Temporarily Removes South Korean Exchanges CoinMarketCap has removed some South Korean exchanges from its price calculations. The removal is only temporary to avoid arbitrage. Leading cryptocurrency market aggregator, CoinMarketCap, removed most South Korean crypto exchanges from its price calculations. The exchange removal is due to the crypto price premium on most South Korean exchanges. [] CoinMarketCap Temporarily Removes South Korean Exchanges CoinMarketCap has removed some South Korean exchanges from its  price calculations. The removal is only temporary to avoid arbitrage. Leading cryptocurrency market aggregator, CoinMarketCap, removed most South Korean crypto exchanges from its price calculations. The exchange removal is due to the crypto price premium on most South Korean exchanges. Particularly, CoinMarketCap has temporarily removed the South Korean exchanges from its Bitcoin price calculations. The aggregator noted that BTC price is currently about 6% higher in South Korea compared to the rest of the world. The price variance or Kimchi Premium also occurred in 2017 and 2018. Notably, if CoinMarketCap includes the South Korean exchanges it will skew the overall price of BTC. As a result, the skewed price will create room for arbitrage. To clarify, arbitrage is trading that exploits small price differences of the same or similar assets in different markets. An arbitrage trader can buy low in one market and sell in the other for a higher price. Thus, CoinMarketCap will only exclude the South Korean exchanges until crypto prices normalize. Fortunately, the Kimchi Premium is temporary. The effect occurs when user demand for cryptos is higher than the exchange supply. Crypto adoption has been at an all-time high with many companies and institutional investors finally investing in different cryptos. However, as crypto adoption has grown so has the need for clearer regulation. In line with this, South Korea has taken steps to tighten its crypto rules. As the crypto world and the rest of the world converge it is inevitable that there will be some fallout. However, the market always moves to correct itself and prices should normalize soon.

Apparently, it looks less likely. HODL  mentality even though the Bitcoin price trades near its previous peak level of $61,778 (data from Coinbase). Traders do not want to realize their profits just yet, the data shows. When the market reaches its peak, everyone deposits BTC to exchanges to sell, wrote Mr. Young. # of inflow addresses across all exchanges was at its highest in 2018 Jan, while it hit a three-year low a few days ago. People are holding, not selling. Why HODLing? Data analytics firm Glassnode noted last monththat the total number of BTC in circulation these days is no more than 4 million. That is reducing by each passing month that could lead to a supply crisis for as long as Bitcoins demand keeps growing higher thanks to a lack of attractive investment alternatives elsewhere. After the cryptocurrencys third halvinglast year  a periodically occurring event that reduces BTCs supply by half, institutions have raised their bets on it vastly.

As mentioned in previous reports , the gradual adoption of Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, by several well-known financial institutions and companies has painted a rather bullish longer-term outlook for the digital asset space. Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and has begun accepting the popular cryptocurrency as a form of payment, while Bank of New York Mellon stated that it would treat the anti-fiat asset the same as any other financial asset. Visa is the latest multinational to embrace blockchain technology, with the company announcing its payments network will utilize a stable coin backed by US dollars to settle transactions over Ethereum These developments may serve as a springboard for broad cryptocurrencies to climb higher in the coming months. Indeed, Ripples native coin , XRP, has surged over 94% in the last three days and pushed back above the $1 handle for the first time since early 2018. This move appears to be linked to progress in Ripples ongoing legal battle with the SEC, with the market cheering the companys ability to ensure its private emails are redacted from the public record. XRP has recovered all lost ground since news of the SEC lawsuit broke in December of 2020, which resulted in the digital asset tumbling over 75% in just one day. A series of bullish technical indicators suggests that this recent period of strength may endure in the weeks ahead. Ripple (XRP/USD) Daily Chart  Ascending Triangle Break Points to Further Gains Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview The technical outlook for XRP appears overtly bullish, as prices validate the topside break of an Ascending Triangle pattern and slice through key psychological resistance at 1.000. With the RSI storming to its highest levels since November, and the slopes of all six moving averages notably steepening, the path of least resistance seems heavily skewed to the upside. That being said, failure to gain a firm foothold above the 127.2% Fibonacci (1.1099) could open the door for a short-term pullback to former resistance-turned-support at the 2020 high (0.7800). However, a deep correction seems relatively unlikely given the flurry of bullish technical signals on display. Ultimately, a daily close above 1.1100 is needed to intensify buying pressure and bring the Ascending Triangles implied measured move (1.1974) into the crosshairs. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Daily Chart  Consolidating Just Shy of Record High Chart prepared by Daniel Moss, created with Tradingview Bitcoin prices are continuing to consolidate in a tight range between the 61.8% Fibonacci (61298) and the 34-EMA (55455), after failing to clear the record high set in mid-March (61699). Bullish moving average stacking, in combination with the RSI and MACD indicators tracking firmly above their respective neutral midpoints, suggests that further gains may be in the offing. A daily close above 61,300 would probably signal the resumption of the primary uptrend and bring the 100% Fibonacci (72503) into play. However, if this resistance level remains intact, a pullback to the trend-defining 55-EMA (52505) may play out. -- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX Follow me on Twitter",https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2021/04/07/Bitcoin-BTC-Consolidating-Below-60K-Ripple-XRP-Surges-to-Multi-Year-Highs.html

License Bitcoin's(CRYPTO: BTC)struggle to breach $60,000 has proved that the price is a crucial resistance level in the current bull run. What Happened: However, the cryptocurrency has also found strong support at $50,000 and an even stronger price floor at $40,000, according to researchfrom Chainalysis. According to the firms chief economist, Philip Gradwell, recent data indicates strong support for high prices. Gradwell finds that 3.1 million Bitcoinshave been acquired at a cost of more than $40,000 and continue to be held, while 1.6 million Bitcoins have been bought and held at above $50,000. Buyers reportedly spent $88 billion to acquire the 1.6 million Bitcoin at an average cost of over $50,000, according to Chainalysis data. Analysing the cost of acquisition over time demonstrates how radically the market has changed in the last few months, to one where there is likely to be a lot of demand from existing buyers to support high price levels,""said Gradwell.

For one, Stochastichas already reached the overbought zone to indicate exhaustion among bulls. Also, the 100 SMA is below the 200 SMA, which means that selling pressure might still be present. Litecoin might retreat to the broken triangle top from here, but buyers could still defend this level and gather even more bullish energy to sustain a rally. : Daily BCH/USD Daily Chart Bitcoin Cash has been cruising inside an ascending trend channelon its long-term chart, and it looks like the uptrend is gaining traction. Price just breached the mid-channel area of interest and is setting its sights on the channel top around $800. At the same time, the 100 SMA is increasing its lead over the 200 SMA to confirm that bullishmomentum is picking up. Just be careful when jumping in a long positionsince Stochastic is already hanging out at the overbought zone to reflect exhaustion among buyers. If sellers take advantage of this situation, BCH could still dip to the channel bottom near $550 again!

315,Bitcoin 101: How Many Bitcoins Are There?,nasdaq,"Apr 07, 2021",2021-04-07 00:00:00,"One of the biggest arguments in favor of using Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) as either a method of payment or a store of value is that it's scarce. But what does that mean exactly? In this Fool Live video clip, recorded on March 18, senior analyst John Rotonti and Motley Fool Deutschland Apr 7, 2021 7:18AM EDT O (CRYPTO: BTC) as either a method of payment or a store of value is that it's scarce. But what does that mean exactly? In this Fool Live video clip, recorded on March 18, senior analyst John Rotonti and Motley Fool Deutschland lead analyst Bernd Schmid discuss how many Bitcoins there are in existence and what investors should know about the supply of the cryptocurrency. 10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. *Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021 John Rotonti: Can you discuss the scarcity factor? Aren't there like a maximum number of Bitcoins allowed? Bernd Schmid: Yes. Rotonti: Why does that matter? How does that factor in? Schmid: The software essentially, that I was mentioning in the very beginning, which all these notes, this network is running, this has defined, there will be 21 million Bitcoins created, and then it will be finished. They are created by this mining process I described earlier. Every time you mine, a new block is being created, which happens on average every 10 minutes, 6.25 new Bitcoins are being created. There's an algorithm which reduces this number every four years, more or less, until I think it's in about 100 years when no more Bitcoins are going to be mined. This will be when you reach the 21 million Bitcoin, and that's it. So why is this important or why is this the deal? I think right now, the main deal about it is that this is the argument for people saying, look, this is something scarce. Something which is scarce has a certain value. Look at gold. The amount of new gold that is being dug out of the ground every year is about 1-2% of the gold that has been dug out of the ground historically. It is relatively scarce. Actually, there's somebody under the pseudonym PlanB, who has created a model, it's called Stock-to-Flow. A Stock-to-Flow is what I just described, how much stock do you have and how much flow of new supply is coming in. For gold, this would be 1-2% per year. I think for silver, it's in the 5-10% range. For Bitcoin, the 6.25 Bitcoin per block, it actually amounts also to about what gold is right now, 1-2% per year, and people ascribe value to it. I think this was a long story. I could've made it shorter, but to bring the point home is, people use this as an argument. Look, this is scarce, this has value. There's a finite supply of it. You cannot just create it out of thin air like U.S. dollars. That's why it's useful buying that. You will later hear I think, today, if you listen to Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, he will I think bring home this point. Bernd Schmid has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

When I'm using Bitcoin and blockchain and all these things and I don't even know, and it's just this beautiful experience. Then you get the Steve Jobs of crypto who says, ""I'm going to make you want something that you didn't even know you needed,"" and you're like, ""Man, I really need an iPhone."" Then we're going to make sure every time we update it, you're going to go out and get it. But it's a beautiful experience.

I'm Anand Chokkavelu, and our next guest on Bitcoin Day here on Motley Fool Live is Nic Carter. His crypto waters run deep. He was Fidelity's first crypto-analyst. He co-founded Coin Metrics, whose mission is to empower people to make informed crypto financial decisions. It sounds a lot like The Motley Fool in the broader investing world. He's a venture capitalist at Castle Island, where they invest exclusively in blockchain companies. He's bringing a lot of knowledge to the table, and he's going to share it with us today. Thanks for spending some time with us today, Nic. Nic Carter: My pleasure. Thanks, Anand. Chokkavelu: Well, Nic, as our name suggests, we're a motley group of investors, but most of us are primarily investors in the stock market. I'd venture that most of our members and readers and viewers don't own any Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. Can you make the elevator pitch for why someone should consider Bitcoin? Carter: Well, I would say, first of all, it's a bet on a novel monetary system, and if that's interesting to you, if you are disaffected with the existing monetary system and you're looking for some alternative monetary rules that are nondiscretionary, that strip human decision-making from that system, then you might find Bitcoin attractive. If you are really interested in nonstate stores of value like gold, you might want to give Bitcoin a look. But it's certainly a pretty novel thing. It's outside of a lot of people's comfort zone. I'm not suggesting that it should be a part of everyone's portfolio or anything like that. But first and foremost, it's a bet on a new monetary system. Then beyond that, it's an index on the growth of this crypto economy, which is now dramatically grown, and Bitcoin is a way to get exposure to that. So it's a growth bet, and then in many ways you could think of it as a hedge, although it doesn't always behave as one. Chokkavelu: Right. Being less than 20 years old, it's hard to get the data on all of that correlation type of things. Carter: Yeah, it's only been around really for 12 years. It's only meaningfully been financialized, I would say, since 2014, 2015. Frankly, we don't know what the correlation characteristics are of Bitcoin, what they're going to be in the long term. But to me it's sufficiently interesting that I decided to spend my career on it. Chokkavelu: Right on. We talked a bit about investing in Bitcoin. For a regular investor who as we know has never invested in cryptocurrency, wants some exposure but doesn't want a lot of hassle, what would your advice be if they came to you and said, ""Hey, what should I do? What's the easiest thing to supplement my stock portfolio?"" Carter: Well, there's obviously thousands of different cryptocurrencies available. I think it's very easy to get distracted and to try and bet on Bitcoin killers or new base players or new smart contract protocols or meme coins. There's a huge amount of noise in the industry and a lot of malinvestment and misspent activity. I think Bitcoin, it's not exactly the highest beta asset in the crypto space. You're going to find more volatile assets, if that's where you're looking for, if you're looking for volatility and excitement. But to me, Bitcoin is really the most important phenomenon within the crypto space. It's a new monetary system. It has that credibility. A lot of these other crypto assets are shallow imitations of it. Certainly there are interesting things going on beyond Bitcoin, but I would just start with Bitcoin, trying to understand that system in the first place, and try and deeply grasp the things that make it unique, and why it's endured 12 years and why it's shrugged off so many competitors in that time. A small amount of Bitcoin exposure would be what I would recommend, such that people can tolerate the volatility of the asset, which is incredibly high, so size it accordingly. Bitcoin has annualized volatility of 80%-100%. If you want to target a level of risk in your portfolio, you want to size your bet accordingly. Chokkavelu: Related question I know I get asked a lot is, ""OK, what's the easiest platform to use? What should I do? Do I get cold storage? Do I go with a provider?"" Have you seen any solutions that, I mean, obviously, the market's evolving and things are better each year. Have you seen anything that's blown your mind as a simple turnkey solution for folks? Carter: No, and frankly, we're dealing with the encoding of value in an informational format. And so we have for the first time digital bearer assets, which means that if you lose your private key, you've lost the value, right? Chokkavelu: The nightmare. Carter: It's a novel thing, right? We didn't have that before. And so the last decade, we've been struggling to try and build tools to make it possible for people to have custody of that information on their own without the threat of being fragile. That's really what we invest in. That's a big part of our investment strategy as a firm, is trying to invest in tools and businesses which help people transact and hold digital assets. For the uninitiated and for folks that aren't holding a huge amount of cryptocurrency, honestly, custodial service providers, there's a few that are extremely credible and that I would personally trust. Now, if you are more paranoid and you want to take final delivery of your coins, that's when you start looking into different kinds of cold-storage setups. But that's only, I would say, if you have a really meaningful amount of coin, and you want to take true custody of the equivalent of storing bars of gold in your basement kind of thing. There's no simple solution to that problem. That's one of just the key intractable problems in the industry, is storing value as information. So it's always been a challenge, and I think it'll be a challenge for a long time. Chokkavelu: To be clear for folks, when you say custodial accounts, you mean places like Coinbase or Robinhood or Gemini or the Cash App. Carter: Yeah, there's significant differences between all of them. Robinhood, for instance, you can't withdraw your coins. From Coinbase, Cash App, and Gemini, you can",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-motley-fools-interview-with-cryptocurrency-expert-nic-carter-2021-04-07

The miner wallets, which are 0 Bitcoin miners started easing their selling process after making more money in March than ever before. The miner wallets, which are used to be emptied, have been swelling in the opposite way for 6 days. Bitcoin miners, who were prepared in advance for this years bull market, managed to almost double their earnings. Miners, who earned a total of $ 329 million a month in September 2020, collected $ 1.5 billion in March this year, according to an analysis firm called Arcane Research in Norway. According to the companys analysis, the increase in the price of Bitcoin was a reward for miners who already had an established system before the bull run started and who were able to interpret the future correctly in the third quarter of 2020. A trend not seen since the beginning of the year Glassnode measures the change in the balance of miner wallets based on the last 30 days of activity. According to the chart shared by Lex Moskovski, the amount of Bitcoin held in these wallets did not decrease for 6 consecutive days, but instead started to increase. Considered to be selling pressure on the market, miners had never accumulated Bitcoins in a row for so long since the beginning of this year.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021 Matt Frankel: I know a lot of the work you do, it's involving cryptocurrency is a mechanism for the unbanked and under-banked segment of the population. Do you view Bitcoin as a replacement for U.S. dollar, it's like a payment bank or a replacement for bank accounts, or a way to store wealth, or all of the above? Tyrone Ross: First, I've got to say that I'm no longer saying unbanked and under-banked. That has become a trope. I say under-served. Yes, I think Bitcoin and other crypto networks are a boon to the under-served of what is allowing for access in those that have been shut out of the traditional financial system due to financial redlining, so yes. To your second point, Bitcoin is all of those things, it's currency, it's money, it's all savings, technology, depending on where you are in the world and the lens of which you look at it. But for me, growing up into a home that was under-served and having used the alternative financial system, my parents, to this day, still use money orders. When I came to Bitcoin because a friend sent it to me and I got it instantly and I'm like, whoa, wait a minute. I don't have to wait 3-6 days from our money to settle? That's how I came to where I think the power of the Bitcoin, big B, blockchain is as opposed to Bitcoin, little b, the coin, which is the price everyone is so over-concerned about. Frankel: It definitely makes sense when you say under-served because it's not just people who don't have access to traditional banking services, it's people that the traditional banking system doesn't necessarily serve them well. Ross: Exactly. Frankel: What you just said, 3-6 days for the check to clear. Ross: Yeah. Frankel: That's not even to mention international money transfers, how long and cost how much money. Ross: Absolutely, $15 to receive a wire, to receive it, $30 to spend it. It's egregious. Matthew Frankel, CFP has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

324,iOS App Defrauded Users out of Millions in Bitcoins,novinite,"Apr 05, 2021",2021-04-05 11:52:53,"Appleboasts that its branded App Store is a safe haven. The same cannot be said about Google Play, where you can find malicious applications. Share Send to Kindle Apple boasts that its branded App Store is a safe haven. The same cannot be said about Google Play, where you can find malicious applications. But not everything is so simple and Apple does not have a mechanism that 100% guarantees that low-quality software does not fall into the open spaces of the application store. After going through the milestones of Apples verification, a fraudulent app called Trezor for trading cryptocurrency entered the App Store. Many thought it was an app from Trezor, a company that specializes in creating hardware wallets for cryptocurrency. Working with this program, the user Phillipe Christodoulou lost 17.1 bitcoins and at the current exchange rate it is about $600 000, they were simply stolen. But he was not the only victim of the scammers. There were at least 4 more people who lost their cryptocurrency and the total damage amounted to $1.6m. It is quite logical that the victims blamed everything on Apple; which allowed the appearance of fraudulent software on the App Store. For its part, the Cupertino-based company said that the developers of the application got through the app store through a bait-and-switch technique. Simply put, they provided a safe version of the app for safe storage of data for verification; and after it was given the go-ahead for placement in the App Store, they changed it to a cryptocurrency wallet. Alas, the fact of the substitution was not detected in time and the creators of the fraudulent software managed to profit quite well. The incident prompted an App Store audit, which resulted in the removal of several apps from the store. What kind of applications it is, how many of them turned out to be and what they were using, the company does not announce. User trust is at the foundation of why we created the App Store; and we have only deepened that commitment in the years since, said Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz. Study after study has shown that the App Store is the most secure app marketplace in the world; and we are constantly at work to maintain that standard and to further strengthen the App Stores protections. In the limited instances when criminals defraud our users, we take swift action against these actors as well as to prevent similar violations in the future,"" he added. It is worth mentioning that a similar fraudulent Trezor app was created for Android devices as well. But Trezor then managed to warn users that it did not have a mobile application; and warned them against installing fake apps.

He was approved by the U.S. Senate with a final tally of 53-45. Gensler did not face much opposition throughout the proceedings. Although Republicans made comments concerning the US capital markets as part of general objections to President Bidens plans to include issues like climate change under the SECs purview, Genslers credentials were well acknowledged. Back in March, he received a 124-10 committee vote. Speaking of his credentials, Gensler served as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during Obamas era. As head of the agency, he spearheaded the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. Subsequently, he taught classes on blockchain technology and digital assets at MIT. In the wake of his confirmation, the existing commissioners of the agency congratulated Gensler. A warm congratulations to Gary Gensler on his Senate confirmation to become Chair of the SEC. He will be joining a dedicated staff that works tirelessly day in and day out on behalf of investors and our markets. We welcome him back to public service and look forward to working together to execute our vital mission.

333,REG Earnings Get a Boost From Fuel Credits -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 12:13:00,"The latest earnings from Renewable Energy Group are the best for any first quarter in the company's history. 16% Source: Company 8-K It is good to see REG continuing to increase production and gallons sold (including inventory) at a time when demand for biodiesel is increasing. That growth will continue to find its way to investors. In fact, shareholders' equity increased 14.8% in the last three months alone. Almost all of the increase was attributable to the BTC, which could leave investors with mixed feelings. On one hand, REG earned the money just like every other reputable biodiesel producer. On the other hand, investors likely won't be able to see big one-time gains in net income again. Biodiesel is a relatively low-margin product, and while the industry should continue to grow for the foreseeable future, growth will be slow and steady. Of course, there is nothing wrong with that -- just don't invest now for the wrong reasons. Outlook Investors should look for continued progress at facilities under construction or renovation. For instance, the Albert Lea, Minn. biorefinery is on track to be commissioned again after upgrades to allow lower cost feedstock capabilities. The company's recently acquired New Boston, Texas, biorefinery will also be operable this quarter. In addition to in-house manufacturing, REG has agreed to terms with Iowa Renewable Energy to contract their 30 million gallon per year (MMgy) multiple feedstock facility. The deal will give REG increased flexibility to respond to volatile feedstock prices. And don't forget the madness that comes at the end of every year as the industry awaits blending requirements for the next year. In 2012, the decision came down to the wire (the reason for the BTC uncertainty in the first place). New legislation has been proposed for axing or overhauling the Renewable Fuel Standard that has the support of both political parties, so this year may not be any better. Fortunately, biodiesel is nowhere near the saturation of ethanol and any amendments should not affect its growth in the long run. A short-term scare is entirely possible. Foolish bottom line The market has finally begun to appreciate REG's performance, management, and growth. Book value stands at $14.85 per share -- $12.14 per share when preferred stock is accounted for -- which means there is still some value to squeeze out of shares. There is also a considerable amount of capacity coming online in the next year or two: 150 MMgy to be exact. Just remember that companies associated with renewable fuels tend to be volatile. My advice: Take a buy-and-hold approach and don't worry about the shocks. REG is still a solid long-term investment.

371,"Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC stumbles while ETH and XRP consolidate rapid gains",fxstreet,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 19:23:52,"The Coinbase (COIN) initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday was matched by daily gains for all three of the major cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum a Bitcoin price prints marginal new high, but Coinbase IPO fails to extend the rally. Ethereum has successfully decoupled from BTC as new hard fork seeks to lower gas fees. Ripple pullback has unfolded in an A-B-C corrective formation after striking psychologically important $2. The Coinbase (COIN) initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday was matched by daily gains for all three of the major cryptocurrencies with Ethereumand Ripple closing with gains of over 3%. In comparison, Bitcoingained less than 2%. Bitcoin price cannot generate momentum to sustain new highs The larger BTC price structure continues to take the form of a rising wedge patternwith one more touch of the upper trend line needed to complete the pattern. It would represent an extension of the rally by another 5% from the April 14 high. To complement the projection of new marginal highs is the unfolding A-B-C corrective formation on the 12-hour chart. BTC was not successful on the first attempt overcoming the resistance at the 361.8% extension of the 2017-2018 bear market at $63,777, so it will remain a resistance level if price strengthens once again. The primary resistance and arbitrator of the bearish outlook is the wedges upper trend line, currently at $67,880. If price reverses, it will trigger a quicker than expected decline that wont find support until the intersection of the 50 twelve-hour simple moving average (SMA) at $58,157 and the wedges lower trend line at $57,700. Below the trend line awaits incremental support beginning with the 100 twelve-hour SMA at $55,787 followed by the April low at $55,400, before a test of the March low at $50,305. BTC/USD 12-hour chart A successful breakout at the wedges upper trend line would trigger a rally to the 461.8% extension of the 2017-2018 bear market at $80,540. Ethereum price tags significant short-term resistance It has been 18 days since the ETH breakout from a symmetrical triangle The rally has overcome the February high at $2,041, the 161.8% Fibonacci extension of the 2018 bear market at $2,247, and just touched the 161.8% extension of the February correction at $2,507 and the triangles measured move target of $2,507. In the process, it registered the best 3-day gain of 17.73% since late January. Once the Fibonaccicluster and measured move target are cleared, ETH could rally to the 261.8% extension of the February extension at $3,253. If the volume continues to rise, the 261.8% extension of the 2018 bear market at $3,587 is the next target. It is important to note that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is not overbought yet. ETH/USD 12-hour chart A reversal of fortunes is always a possibility in investing, and ETH speculators should mark the early April highs as the first level of support if heavy selling emerges. The following support level is at the February high of $2,041. A failure there cancels the bullish outlook and puts price on course to test the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $1,835. XRP price weakness being bought by speculators Every rally needs consolidation, and that is precisely what has been taking place in Ripple since the April 14 high. The cross-border remittances token gained over 200% from April 5 to April 14, sparked by a bullish news roll. The 3-day correction has taken the form of an A-B-C correction and it touched the projected 38.2% retracement level of the April rally at $1.42. Further weakness may emerge, but the bullish reversal today from the retracement level suggests that there are eager speculators taking advantage of the decline. A close in the upper half of the daily bar would confirm it. Upside targets include $2.00, the 61.8% retracement of the 2018-2020 bear market at $2.08, and the 78.6% retracement at $2.62, for the ambitious speculators. In the medium term, it is projected that Ripple will test the all-time high at $3.30. XRP/USD 12-hour chart A breach of the 38.2% retracement would dampen the bullish thesis and delay a successful break of $2 into May or later.

Bitcoin did a write-up on how receiving half of his salary in bitcoin has helped Russell Okung. Jamie Redmanexplained how bitcoin will work in Russell Okung's favor.

However, the NFL has recently decideed to cap the league's salaries at $180 million and a ball player's contract could change in 2021. Because the Carolina Panthers' offensive tackle gets half of his salary in BTC, many proponents think of him as the highest-paid player in the NFL and not just ahead of the highest paid offensive tackles."" Russell Okung could start a new trend with him making a ton of money off of Bitcoin. Okung said this about how he continues to accumulate Bitcoin over time.

375,What are Bitcoin Trust Funds and how do they work?,techgenyz,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 13:16:08,"With a number of pros and cons of Bitcoins, its also essential for you to know what are Bitcoin Trust Funds and how it works Bitcoin Sharing | Image credit: Freepik What are Bitcoin Trust Funds and how do they work? Bitcoin Apr 16, 2021, 6:46 pm Bitcoins rise to fame was triggered by the bull market phase, which had a great impact on Bitcoin price. Namely, the price of Bitcoin had recently surpassed $60,000, while it has a continual growth since 2020, with many notable records including a price of $20,000 in December. This has resulted in an ever-rising number of retail and institutional investors. In fact, the demand from institutional investors that include crypto and Bitcoin trust investment funds only moved the price further. If you also want to get BTC, here we explain what the advantages of investing through investment trust funds are. Bitcoin investment trust funds Before we dive in, we will explain what Bitcoin and Bitcoin investmenttrust funds are. Bitcoin is a completely virtual cryptocurrency that is used as a decentralized medium to exchange funds over a peer-to-peer blockchain network. Its value is based on the demand and supply in the market, and hence, as the demand is increasing on a global scale, the price is also rising. Bitcoin investment trust fund works like other investment trust funds. Generally, a crypto trust fund is a publicly listed financial institution that invests in financial assets on behalf of its investors. When youre investing in BTC through investment trust funds, you are essentially buying Bitcoins share. As an investor, you dont need to bother with researching about crypto or finding secure means of storage. All aspects of the trading and the storage of your funds are entrusted to the trust funds. Of course, that comes with a price based on the size of your investment and the politics of the crypto trust fund. For example, Grayscale Investment Trust, which is a well-known Bitcoin trust fund, charges an annual fee of 2% of the funds assets. In other words, this means if you have invested in 1 Bitcoin, over time, the value will decrease to 0.092 because there are fees associated with the services offered by the crypto trust fund. If you want to invest in BTC directly, there is an abundance of trading sites like Bitqs, for example, which is a top automated trading site. You can sign up for freeto find out more about the automated system, how it works, and how you can register on the site. Otherwise, the platform utilizes high-end AI technology which conducts all trading automatically for you. In terms of trading, the environment is fully safe and transparent, so you can rest assured that your data is safe here. Pros and cons of investment trust funds The main advantage is that it is much more convenient to invest through an investment trust fund, especially for institutional investors. For individual investors, it might be too expensive, especially if they want to make long-term investments. The main advantage is that the value of Bitcoin tends to rise in Bitcoin Trust Funds when the price of Bitcoin increases. For example, in 2018, the share of the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust was trading at a price of $7.95, which was over 20% higher than the general price of Bitcoin. But, whether the price of the shares declines or rises higher than the general price of Bitcoin it is mainly affected by the number of investors that are buying BTC through the fund. In other words, it is possible for a Bitcoin trust fund to sell shares at a price 42% higher than the current Bitcoins worth. But, when the price decreases, the trust might close with a much lower price than the value of Bitcoin. So, its up to you to make a cost-effective analysis when it comes to investing in BTC, whether through an online trading site or investment trust funds. Make sure to take into consideration the fees you will need to pay, the reputability of the institutions, and other factors that are relevant to your financial goals",https://www.techgenyz.com/2021/04/16/what-are-bitcoin-trust-funds-and-how-do-they-work/

With BTC's volatile price swinging high and low, experts have discussed whether the token could hit 50,800 ($70,000) before the year is over. As of 10.45am BST on April 16, bitcoin appears to have hit a stumbling block and is trending downwards. The virtual token is trading for 44,067.43 ($60,623.03) - down three percent on the last 24 hours. The drop may have been caused by a sell-off triggered by Turkey's decision to ban cryptocurrencies. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) said on Friday cryptos and crypto-based assets would be banned as a form of payment from April 30.

(Image: GETTY) Bitcoin price: The token has hit an all-time high price this week (Image: COINDESK) Dogecoin price skyrockets to all-time high as Elon Musk drives frenzy According to the CBRT, the decision was motivated by bitcoin's lack of centralisation and regulation - a key feature of the digital currency. Veteran crypto adopters, however, are likely to be unfazed by the decision even if short-term investors are deterred. And after prices shot past the 46,600 ($64,000) mark on Wednesday, April 14, many are now left wondering whether the token can still go from strength to strength. According to Pankaj Balani, the CEO of Delta Exchange, there is some possibility of the token rising even higher as we go into the summer. Martin Lewis issues warning about Bitcoin scams However, there is also the possibility the market is due a correction and BTC prices could drop to more stable levels. Mr Balani said: ""With BTC around the $63,000 level, the options market is pricing in a 40 percent chance of $70,000 and 31 percent of $58,000 by the end of May. ""Post the recent spike in bitcoin, the shorter dated implied volatility (April, May) has started to trade higher and is only a tad bit short of that of June and September expiries.

379,Bitcoin And Cryptocurrencies Retrace After Another Leg Up,usethebitcoin,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 06:46:56,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other virtual currencies have now retraced after the large gains registered in recent days. Bitcoin (BTC) and other virtual currencies have now retraced after the large gains registered in recent days. It is worth mentioning that Ethereum (ETH) has registered new all-time highs after surpassing $2,500. Nevertheless, the second-largest virtual currency is now 7% down from this high registered a few hours ago. Cryptocurrencies Make a Pause After Massive Growth Bitcoin continues to be the leader in the market with a market valuation of over $1.1 trillion and a dominance of 52%. During a conversation with UseTheBitcoin, Nick Spanos, the co-founder of Zap.org, explained that the run in the price of Bitcoin is currently fueled by two core events. The first one is related to the Coinbase listing. This is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. In recent years the company was able to attract millions of users from different countries offering them the possibility to trade digital assets. The second thing that Spanos takes into consideration is an Exchange-Traded product (ETF). There are several companies involved in offering a Bitcoin ETF product. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should make a decision on whether to approve it or not. On the matter, Spanos mentioned: The count of companies seeking an ETF is also on the rise as investors press on the SEC for its first approval. All these factors are poised to push Bitcoin to a new high of $70,000 by the end of April. We are getting closer to the end of the month and we could see Bitcoin moving higher even further. Nevertheless, the virtual currency has recently retraced from $64,800 to $61,300. Other digital assets have also experienced large growth rates in recent days and a retracement in the last hours. Some of the coins that are now correcting include Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and Uniswap (UNI). The coins that are still operating positively include Litecoin(LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE). It is worth mentioning that Dogecoin and Litecoin tend to operate in similar ways considering they are both using Scrypt. This requires less power than traditional ASIC mining for Bitcoin (BTC) and makes it easier for Litecoin users to mine not only LTC but also DOGE at the same time. The cryptocurrency market is accelerating and we could see prices that only the most bullish analysts could predict. Nevertheless, we should also be prepared to reach a top and start to reverse the gains.",https://usethebitcoin.com/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies-retrace/
380,The South Korean Government Sells a Large Number of Confiscated Bitcoins,releasewire,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 01:45:00,"In March 2021, according to relevant news from ZB, the South Korean government sold a confiscated bitcoin. The money was valued at more than 10.8 million U.S. dollars at the time of sale. It was confiscated from a criminal who engaged in pornographic websites in 2017. The profits have been deposited into the South Korean treasury. In March 2021, according to relevant news from ZB, the South Korean government sold a confiscated bitcoin. The money was valued at more than 10.8 million U.S. dollars at the time of sale. It was confiscated from a criminal who engaged in pornographic websites in 2017. The profits have been deposited into the South Korean treasury. In the inquiry of relevant information, it was found that the bitcoin was confiscated by the South Korean government from an unhealthy website operator named Ahn, with a total of 191.32333418 pieces. According to the relevant report of Yonhap in 2018, the South Korean procuratorate will hand over the proceeds from the sale of the bitcoin to the Ministry of finance.Onbid, an online property trading system owned by Kamco, is responsible for the auction of the bitcoin.In early 2018, the bitcoin was worth 28 million won, or about $28000, while the proceeds from the sale of the bitcoin in March 2021 exceeded $10 million. Bitcoin's ""a slap in the face"" behavior In the Internet era, people describe that they don't want something, but their bodies honestly accept it, which is called ""Zhenxiang"". In the relevant policies of some rights institutions on digital assets, ""Zhenxiang"" still applies. On the one hand, digital assets represented by bitcoin are inherently monetary, which has set the tone when Nakamoto founded bitcoin and bitcoin network.Blockchain itself is to solve the ""point-to-point"" non trust ""value exchange"" in the Internet. It is a trust based ""currency"" in the Internet. It is the unique ""currency"" attribute of bitcoin, rather than the decentralized mode of trust, that makes governments around the world very resistant to it.Because it has the property of currency, it may threaten the status of legal currency, and decentralization makes it impossible for the government to carry out thorough supervision over special currency. For example, the current Federal Reserve has been releasing more dollars to promote trade and stabilize the domestic economy.We need to know that currency is equivalent to the certificate of all the labor achievements of the people of the country endorsed by the authority.Only when the productivity is improved or the people's labor achievements are accumulated, can there be a reasonable space for issuing more money.Too much money or deliberately less money will lead to the rise or fall of prices, and the rise and fall of prices will ultimately be borne by all citizens of the country. The Fed's excessive ""throwing money"" behavior of issuing additional currency is not based on the economic growth and productivity improvement of the U.S. citizens, but purely printing money, which will inevitably lead to the dilution of the value of the U.S. dollar, and the diluted value of the U.S. dollar will also affect the original U.S. dollar.Then, all those who originally held dollars would suffer visible or invisible losses due to the Fed's over issuance of money. Only when the American people bear this kind of loss, can the government manage smoothly.However, if people generally no longer use US dollars but use bitcoin instead, they will not be able to issue additional bitcoin, nor will they be able to supervise and control the value of bitcoin. Under this situation, the U.S. authorities will not be able to obtain benefits from the additional issuance of bitcoin, and naturally they will no longer be able to carry out ""smooth governance"". Of course, the United States and the Federal Reserve are just one example, and the South Korean government is also considering the same. Therefore, the authority will hardly allow bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to flow into the market in large quantities without its full control.However, the value represented by digital assets is what these centralized institutions are not willing to give up. Therefore, there is the ""truth"" behavior of the South Korean government in the face of ""all kinds of bans"" on cryptocurrency, while selling the bitcoin to fill the Treasury. Opportunities behind Behind the sale of the bitcoin by the South Korean government is a thought-provoking problem, that is, from the perspective of centralized institutions, bitcoin and other digital assets are valuable, or more generally, valuable. Since the government can participate in the transaction of decentralized digital assets, it indirectly shows the applicability and cognitive breadth of digital assets.This represents that more and more government actions in the future will be inextricably linked with digital assets.The ""value"" of digital assets will also be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. As long as there is a ""consensus"" on behalf of the ""value"" of digital assets, it is precisely this common understanding of the ""value"" of digital assets that will make digital assets more widely used in everyone's life. Although some commentators believe that South Korea's selling of BTC will cause some fluctuations in the currency market and lead to a drop in the currency price.But in the long run, this is exactly the key to further enhance the value of bitcoin. At the same time, it is also the beginning of the real participation of digital assets in the circulation of social value. Almost predictably, there will be more and more digital asset transactions involving the government, and more and more digital asset transactions led by bitcoin will be put on the table.

Heath Streak has been banned for eight years by the ICC for breaching their anti-corruption code.  AFP Former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak's shocking admission of cricket corruption has also shone a light on cryptocurrency finding a place in the bookies' list of enticements -- a brand new challenge for the ICC's Anti-Corruption Unit, which claims to be ready for the battle. Streak was on Wednesday banned by the ICC for eight years after admitting to disclose inside information to a suspected Indian bookie during his coaching stints in Zimbabwe, Bangladesh as well as the IPL, Afghanistan Premier League and the Bangladesh Premier League. Till date, cash has been the most preferred mode of payment for bookies, who also pay in kind with cars, jewellery and high-end phones. However, Streak's case has thrown up the use of bitcoin in corrupt payments. The ICC's detailed judgement in the case has revealed that Streak once received two ""bitcoins"" from a corruptor in 2018, valued at $35,000 at that time. ""It is a new phenomenon for us, but we have staff capable of investigating it. Corrupters try to use all modes including cash and 'hawala', which are not easy to trace either. Bitcoins pose a similar challenge,"" ICC ACU General Manager Alex Marshall said in an email reply to PTI's query on Thursday. So what is cryptocurrency? In layman's language, ""Cryptocurrency"" is virtual money. It is the purchase of a digital asset based on an algorithm. The bitcoins that are generated aren't regulated by any central banking authority in any country (like the Reserve Bank of India) and in many countries like India, it is still an illegal tender. In simpler words, it is a ""Blockchain Industry"" where a financial transaction between two people sitting in two different parts of the world will not have any intermediaries. The valuation of one bitcoin is staggering. One bitcoin's INR value currently stands at Rs 46.83 lakh or $62,453. However, the bigger challenge is that coding of ""cryptocurrency"" is believed to be watertight. There are elaborately programmed vaults (digital) and the tracking can be infinitely more difficult when compared to paper tenders like INR, USD or GBP. Marshall said that ICC is up for the challenge in the coming days now that a new method of corruption has emerged. ""Tracking bitcoin transactions may not be easy but we have the right people with the right expertise, understanding and network needed to ensure we stay ahead of the corruptors,"" Marshall said. Even BCCI's new head of Anti Corruption Unit (ACU) Shabbir Hussain Shekhadam Khandwawala said that he heard of payment through bitcoins for the first time. ""Yes, I was going through the details of the Heath Streak case. I have also heard about bitcoin transaction for the first time,"" the former DGP of Gujarat Police told PTI. However, Hussain feels that tracking of corrupt people is not always about the keeping a vigil on the mode of transactions. ""We always catch the people not by the amount or how the money is paid (bitcoins in this case). Our clues are different. We keep a watch on them and their activities and telephonic calls,"" Hussain said. ""Some things happen underground also,"" he said, adding ""Everything has to be on the basis of the solid information received from sources. ""So if someone has accepted money or been involved in graft in any form, once you start investigation, you are able to reach that,"" he said.

In 2013, Bitcoin was crowned ""word of the year"" by the Australian National Dictionary Centre, it crossed the $1,200 threshold but halved in value in just a split second, it raised eyebrows among regulators and world-class economists, while its ""rebellious nature"" allured Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

Throughout 2013 and as the Bitcoin craze begun to gather pace, the number of new users skyrocketed to nearly one million.

At the time, it was the second most popular website after WordPress to accept Bitcoin as a payment option.

On Wednesday morning, the leading crypto set a new all-time high of $64,863.10 after a week-long bullish momentum. Over the last seven days, BTC is up by almost 12%, [] Bitcoin Builds Momentum To $75k: Hits New All-Time High (BTC) has been building momentum over the last week, heading toward a possible new high above $70k. On Wednesday morning, the leading crypto set a new all-time high of $64,863.10 after a week-long bullish momentum. Over the last seven days, BTC is up by almost 12%, confirming the bullish momentum. Many analysts have linked the market uptrend of Bitcoin and other altcoins to Coinbases Nasdaq debut. Bitcoin is continuing its brilliant run of form in 2021, breaking new records with the prospect of breaking even more. One of the prospects, which many investors and enthusiasts would love, would be seeing Bitcoin trade at $75k. Bitcoin Sets A New All-Time High Following a good run of form, Bitcoin (BTC) broke past $63k to set a new ATH at $64,863.10. The run that began on April 7, with BTC trading at $58,186.51, peaked on Wednesday, April 14, when the leading crypto set a new ATH at nearly $65k. Bitcoins run has defied all odds and those critics who have been waiting since the start of the year for the Bitcoin bubble to burst. While they continue to wait, BTC is building even more momentum, looking at higher targets in the coming weeks. Building Momentum For $75k At the start of this year, talk of Bitcoin at $60k would have been considered crazy by many. However, today, BTC currently trades above $62k while aiming higher, and the charts are in its favor. Breaking above the $62,000 zone means that BTC has formed an ascending triangle pattern on the four-hour chart. Remaining above $62k could see BTC soar above $65k or possibly even higher in the short term. The only thing that could negate this trend is if BTC falls under $59,000. If Bitcoin, and the entire crypto market, holds on to the bullish momentum, Bitcoin is bound to break out even higher. The first major mark it would reach would be $70k before moving higher to $75k. Even if the uptrend plays out, we should expect a short-lived pullback or two as Bitcoin journeys to new highs. The crypto market joined Bitcoin for the bullish run as it climbed into uncharted territory on Wednesday morning, surpassing $2.23 trillion in market capitalization. The momentum builds as Coinbase makes its debut on Nasdaq. On the Flipside Bitcoin is witnessing a pullback after breaking its previous all-time high of $62k. In the early hours of Wednesday, Bitcoin peaked at $64,863.10 before the drop began. A 24-hour chart of the biggest cryptocurrency shows a 2% price drop, meaning BTC now changes hands for around $61,918. Coinbase Is Now Live On Nasdaq Coinbase, the most valuable crypto exchange with a market valuation of about $100 billion and 56 million verified retail customers, has opened on Nasdaq. Surprising many, Coinbase has avoided taking the initial public offering (IPO) route. Instead of an IPO, Coinbase has opted for a direct listing. Direct listings are known for being cost-efficient and give existing shareholders the option of selling their shares right away. Coinbase opened on Nasdaq on Wednesday morning with a starting reference price of $250. Coinbases debut on Nasdaq makes it the first major crypto business to list on the US stock market. Many analysts have attributed Bitcoins uptrend to Coinbases listing on Nasdaq.

397,Bitcoin (BTC) Reaches All-Time High Amid Strengthened Bullish Trend,yahoo,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 07:28:00,"Despite the drop, bitcoin validated the previous breakout level and has now begun to move upwards. Its currently increasing towards the closest resistance... The approval comes just over two months after Canada approved its first bitcoin ETF. 21h ago Huarong Debacle Highlights Problems at Hundreds of Chinese Banks (Bloomberg) -- Lai Xiaomin, former chairman of China Huarong Asset Management Co., was found guilty of accepting $277 million in bribes, as well as bigamy, crimes serious enough to see him summarily executed in January.Such extreme behavior -- and consequences -- are rare in any country. But in China, more modest but still flagrant mismanagement is common in the $54 trillion financial industry.In 2020 alone, the countrys top banking regulator issued almost 3,200 violations against institutions and 4,554 against individuals ranging from senior executives to rank-and-file staff; it levied fines totaling 2.3 billion yuan ($352.2 million). In the U.S., which has a much longer history of bank regulation, the Federal Reserve took 58 enforcement actions in total.Among the infractions, Chinese investigators found fabricated financial statements, executives nannies and chauffeurs installed as controlling shareholders, and favorable rates and sweetheart deals for investors and relatives.The state has also bailed out three poorly-run small lenders and merged dozens more since its first crackdown three years ago. Still, out of 4,400 financial institutions, 12.4% are designated at high risk for failure by the central bank. Now, the government is rewriting the commercial banking law and will have zero tolerance for transgressions.Poor governance is obviously a risk for financial stability, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia economist of Natixis SA. If its contained within the countrys smallest institutions, the potential for damage is minimal, she added.The issue is that we dont really know whether governance problems are really contained and this is the big risk.The past week offered a fuller picture of the costs of mismanagement and unchecked corruption. Huarong, which has around $42 billion in outstanding debt at home and abroad, delayed its earnings report in early April, beginning a spiral thats seen its bonds fall to a record low of about 52 cents on the dollar. Its shares are down 67% since the 2015 debut and currently suspended.A China Huarong spokesperson said Thursday the company learned the lesson from Lai Xiaomins case, firmly implemented central government policies, continued to eliminate the toxic influence, restored our corporate governance, accelerated business transformation and management reform, and enhanced corporate governance to move toward stable and better development.Its the second time in two years that creditors have been left at the mercy of bad actors. In 2019, China jolted global markets with a surprise seizure of Baoshang Bank Co., once seen as a model for funding regional economies. Triggered by the misappropriation of funds by its controlling shareholder, the takeover and eventual bankruptcy of Baoshang also called into question long-held assumptions of a perpetual government backstop.In general, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has placed the blame for problems in the financial system on bank directors, shareholders and executives, saying in a December statement that ineffective corporate governance is the root cause.In one example, a rural bank lent the equivalent of 95% of its net capital to its shareholders and affiliates, according to the CBIRC, which didnt name the bank. Most of those loans defaulted or are non-performing.The largest shareholder at one bank inflated revenues by 80 million yuan to make the institution look profitable. Elsewhere, one person and 22 of what the regulator described as his shadow affiliates held stakes in 17 banks, far exceeding the limits on banking ownership.The regulator has also identified bad behavior in its own ranks, putting its official in charge of oversight of the rural banks under investigation for severe disciplinary and law violations.Social media, too, has allowed employees to air grievances and reports of wrongdoing. Earlier this year, a whistle-blower at China Life Insurance Co. claimed on the social network Sina Weibo that the branch head fabricated client signatures and pocketed millions of dollars of non-existent marketing expenses. Following a CBIRC investigation, the company said in a statement that it was fined 510,000 yuan for inadequate internal controls broadly and pledged to enhance compliance education.In response to the rising risks, the central bank is revising its commercial bank law. The proposed changes include a new chapter on corporate governance, which for the first time specifies the responsibilities of shareholders and the key role of the board of directors. It also bars entities from using borrowed money to invest in banks and prohibits directors from holding posts at more than one affiliated institution.Unlike in the U.S. and Europe where misconduct and mismanagement often lead to public outcry, regulatory probes, and even high-profile firings, top leaders have been so far insulated in China. Senior executives are rarely held responsible for branch-level violations, and the financial penalties pale compared with the 1.9 trillion yuan of profit the industry earned last year.This is work in progress, said James Stent, author of Chinas Banking Transformation and a former banker whos spent more than a decade on the boards of two Chinese lenders. Governance is generally good at priority large banks, but problems remain at lower level financial institutions. Addressing them will take time, and governance will always be imperfect.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 2d ago",http://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-btc-reaches-time-high-072800080.html
398,This Nigerian Peer Brings Crypto and Art Together,paxful,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 07:16:42,"Joseph Ebuka is a Peer from Nigeria that incorporated Bitcoin into his art and freelance business. Read on and find out how he did it. Joseph Ebuka , a Peer from Lagos City in Nigeria whos not only an active crypto trader and blockchain enthusiast but an art curator and freelancer as well. Instead of focusing on one thing to achieve his creative and financial goals, he brought together his love for art and Bitcoin (BTC) and made them work for him. Want to know how? Learn as Joseph shares how hes able to enjoy the best of both worlds. The beginning of his art journey Joseph started to have a keen interest in art when one of his friends shared rewarding opportunities with him. My love for art and the creative energy of the artists around me made me join the art business. We then decided to create a community of artists and creatives under a brand umbrella called Cokespice, he said. He started earning money from art when his group hosted their first traditional art exhibition in Abuja back in 2017. This exhibit became an avenue for featured local artists to showcase their incredible crafts, connect with art collectors, and make money from commissioned works. Ive just started my journey into the art collection and I have about four artworks in my gallery already. Right now, my most preferred medium of art is oil paintings on canvas, but Im also interested in graphics and pencil art, Joseph added. Navigating creative opportunities with Bitcoin It was only less than a year ago when Joseph started crypto trading. Hes using the Paxful mobile application to trade and manage his crypto funds anytime and anywhere. Since hes an active trader and his savings are mostly in crypto, Joseph found it easy to use Bitcoin in his freelance art business. But how smooth are crypto transactions on Paxful? He told us, It was a pretty swift process. My recent purchase was a physical painting, so I went to the artists studio. He also owns a Paxful Wallet, which made the transaction easier and faster. All I did was ask for his wallet address and send him my BTC payment. Since it was an internal transfer, I was charged with 0 fees and the artist received my payment instantly. According to Joseph, Bitcoin will add more value to both the art and the artist since they can withdraw money in the currency they prefer, and their artworks can be exchanged as a token for value. I actually buy artwork based on its perceived valueits not just a painting, its also an investment based on value exchange, he stated. Is blockchain the future of art? Joseph deems that blockchain technology can create a significant shift in the art world soon. I believe that blockchain is the future of art, and that future is now. Hes also looking forward to the growth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)digital tokens tied to unique tradable assetsin the African scene. Based on the recognition of talents and crafts, the art and paint industry in Nigeria has done well enough to be recognized. Im excited to see a major shift in the art industry in the near future, especially with the rise of crypto in the art market. Theres so much potential, he stated. Joseph also attends art auctions on Telegram, where he connects with international and local artists selling their works on blockchain platforms. He spreads the word about Bitcoin and blockchain technology with others who arent very familiar with it, whenever possible. Are you an art enthusiast with a passion for Bitcoin?

399,Nigerian Blockchain Educator Says Uncertain Regulations and Scams Slow Adoption of Cryptocurrencies  Interview Bitcoin News,bitcoin,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 06:40:12,"With a population of over 200 million, Nigeria is widely regarded as one the biggest crypto markets in the world. 3 hours ago Nigerian Blockchain Educator Says Uncertain Regulations and Scams Slow Adoption of Cryptocurrencies With a population of over 200 million, Nigeria is widely regarded as one the biggest crypto markets in the world. Some in the crypto world believe Nigeria is one of the few countries better placed to see a greater acceptance of digital currencies. However, despite this optimism, the Nigerian crypto industry continues to be plagued by constant hurdles that then complicate mass adoption efforts. Some of the problems faced include an uncertain regulatory environment as well as the proliferation of bitcoin-related scams which often taint the image of cryptocurrencies. However, according to Tony Emeka, the founder and CEO of Cryptotvplusa Nigerian crypto-focused media organization, some of these challenges can be overcome through education. Nigeria is very active when it comes to digital currencies and is one of the top countries in Africa in terms of cryptocurrency trade volumes. However, Nigerias blockchain and cryptocurrency industry has been dealing with regulatory uncertainty. In a question and answer session with Bitcoin.com News, Emeka discusses his latest education project Earnathonand why believes it will make a difference. The CEO also shares his views on the current impasse between the Central Bank of Nigeria and the crypto industry. To kick things off, Terence Zimwara (TZ) of Bitcoin.com News asked Emeka to share the background and experiences that motivated him to focus his efforts on crypto education? Tony Emeka (TE): The Nigerian crypto industry is noted to be one of the largest in the world considering market data. This growth has been due to the bad state of affairs of the nation and a strong enthusiasm by Nigerians to break free and make something for themselves. However, this celebrated growth has only been possible because of education. However, it has not been easy considering negative sentiments towards cryptocurrency as a tool for scams. Still, with the help of many individuals and business organisations, including Cryptotvplus, the industry has grown considerably. For instance, Cryptotvplus, through its education platform the Campus Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Awareness Tour (BCAT), has helped to raise awareness of blockchain and cryptocurrency across Nigeria since 2019. At one point, Cryptotvplus helped to organize one of the largest crypto-focused gatherings in West Africa. The education platform also helped to expose tens of thousands of individuals mostly students to crypto. On seeing the success of the BCAT campaign across Nigerian universities, it occurred to the team that there was a need to do more. For mass adoption to be achieved, it was imperative to automate the process and have millions of people learning crypto all at once. We also observed how incentivizing attendees via airdrops helped bring a lot of people to crypto. These experiences and ideas were the basis of Earnathon. To bring crypto education to millions of people globally. TZ: What is your impression on what is currently happening in the Nigerian crypto space, education-wise? TE: Education plays a unique role in shaping any (emerging) industry. Globally, there has been an increase in crypto education as well as greater awareness. This is reflected in the trackable search trends and user adoptions. But more has to be done. For mass adoption to be achieved, education efforts need to go to the grassroots. This is one thing that has been missing and now it is one of the things we are looking to do through Earnathon. TZ: I know crypto scams are a problem in Nigeria. Are you specifically dealing with this issue as well? TE: While scams cannot be eradicated totally they can be reduced to very low numbers. In Nigeria and around the world, crypto-related scams have risen and continue to rise, but quality crypto education is the key, the only potent weapon to fight fraudulent actors. Regulators can issue warnings and enforcement agencies will arrest bad actors. However, since these organizations are mostly reactive, education presents a fascinating solution. When people are proactive as a result of sound crypto knowledge, they can easily beat bad actors. Education is thus key. TZ: Now as someone who is trying to help raise awareness on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, how do you rate the ignorance levels in Government and the CBN? TE: The CBN stated in a circular published on February 7, 2021, that financial institutions could no longer facilitate crypto-related transactions. Surprisingly, the CBN position has been supported by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a few months after the same regulator classified cryptocurrencies as securities. This shows that the CBN and the govt still lack a good understanding of cryptocurrencies and money. TZ: So in your view, did the CBN fully understand (cryptocurrencies) or it just rushed its directive back in February? TE: The Circular on February 7th was somewhat from a position of fear. It was reactive. The apex bank ought to be proactive. The government had earlier noted it wanted to explore blockchain technology. This is only possible by creating a good environment for existing businesses to grow. But the circular was a setback for many businesses and thus, it seems rushed. TZ: How can this impasse between the crypto industry and the CBN be ended? TE: The position of the CBN on cryptocurrency seems to be on a faulty foundation. But progress can only come by engaging the regulator, showing them the possibilities, the importance of cryptocurrency and blockchain. No organization wants an intruder. Educating the CBN will enable it to see cryptocurrencies as tools for economic growth. Do you agree with Emekas assertion that education is a key step that will guarantee a greater acceptance of cryptos?

Despite a decline in whale addresses, Bitcoin whale transactions have increased while the cryptocurrencyreached record highs Market sentiment toward Bitcoin has also skyrocketed in the past 24 hours, shifting from relatively bearish to overwhelmingly bullish for the first time in two months. However, according to historical data, extremely bullish sentiment led to corrections in the past. Santiments data suggests that Bitcoin is approaching peak hype, which could mean that further consolidation could be coming. Bitcoin's perpetual contract funding rate also rose in tandem with its price, reaching as high as 0.1% on Binance. In the recent rally, Bitcoin longs are paying shorts, as sentiment is extremely bullish. However, high funding rates have marked each Bitcoin cycle top, indicating fast-rising bullish bias and a market full of overleveraged longs, according to Santiment. Bitcoin could be aiming for further price appreciation After reaching its record high, the recent Bitcoin correctionwas also likely due to a spike in Bitcoins Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL), suggesting that investors are increasingly taking profit. The pioneer digital currencys inability to surpass $65,000 was likely due to sell-offs and profit-taking. Bitcoin NPL However, Bitcoin price could still be aiming for further growth, as both Bitcoins short-term and long-term MVRV ratios remain relatively low. The higher the MVRV ratio, the more unrealized profits  the higher the chance Bitcoin holders could begin to take profit and reduce their exposure. Santiment further suggests that although overall trends point to further Bitcoin price appreciation a short-term correction may be needed for the market to properly normalize.

Bitcoin (BTC) Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitcoin? Balances - block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions - private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing - mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.

And I'm partially to blame -- my previous bitcoin article was about places where you can spend the virtual currency. Many people have no idea how to acquire bitcoins. With this in mind, here is a quick guide on how to get some bitcoins of your own to spend or to hold. Two ways to get them When it comes to acquiring bitcoins, there are two main ways to do it: mining or buying. Mining involves buying expensive computing equipment that solves complex mathematical problems in the bitcoin network, for which the ""miner"" is rewarded with newly created coins. The problem with mining is that as more coins are mined and as more people join in, the process gets exponentially more difficult, diminishing both returns and the value of the hardware itself. At this point, being profitable in bitcoin mining is a very speculative venture, and is probably best left to professionals. That brings us to buying bitcoins, however it's not quite as easy as it sounds. Here is a quick guide to buying bitcoins for your own ""wallet."" Buying from an exchange There are a few bitcoin exchanges out there, such as Coinbase, where people can create their own bitcoin ""wallet"" and purchase their own bitcoins. All you need to do is set up an account, link and verify your bank account, and buy your bitcoins at the current exchange rate. Buying on Coinbase takes a few days before your bitcoins are available in your wallet, but you pay the price shown at the time you place your order. And there is an ""instant buy"" feature with lower daily limits that requires you to link a Visa credit card to your account. While Coinbase is the biggest and most reputable place to buy bitcoins, there are several other exchanges, and a good list is available here Be careful of scams, however, and make sure you verify the authenticity of any exchange before making a purchase. Just a hint: the prices should be close to each other on all legitimate exchanges. If Coinbase is selling bitcoins for $400 and a small exchange lists the price as $320, it should be a big red flag. Can I use my credit card or buy with cash? Not really. I mentioned that Coinbase allows you to link a credit card, but this is a backup payment method only. In other words, if your bank declines a purchase transaction, Coinbase can charge your credit card. As far as cash goes, you can buy with cash, but it's a little tough to do right now for most people. The good news is that it's getting easier. The new concept of a bitcoin ATM has really caught on, and in just a few months, a pretty good network of ATMs has been built up, as you can see on this map Using a bitcoin ATM, you can use cash to purchase bitcoins, and some machines allow you to exchange your own bitcoins for cash. Check out these examplesfrom Genesis Coin to see what they look like. As bitcoin becomes more and more mainstream, this network should continue to expand. Coming soon While it's not the most complicated act in the world to buy bitcoins today, it's definitely not as mainstream-friendly as it could be. For instance, if there were a bitcoin ATM in every American town, or if bitcoins could be easily acquired with a credit card, I'd be willing to bet a lot more people would get involved. And, that may be coming sooner than you think, thanks to the rapid expansion of the bitcoin ATM network, and PayPal's recent first step toward bitcoin integration by allowing its merchants to accept bitcoin payments. While it may be some time away, if PayPal's 100 million active users are able to buy, hold, and transfer bitcoins in their accounts, it could be the big push bitcoin needs to really break into the mainstream. In the meantime, unless you happen to live near one of the ATMs, an online exchange (specifically Coinbase) linked to your bank account is the best way to get your hands on some of the virtual currency.

414,Bitcoin (BTC) almost reaches $65K high ahead of Coinbase direct listing,shacknews,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 14:31:00,"As Coinbase prepares to go public in the stock market, it has boded well for the valuation of various cryptocurrencies. 1 Coinbase has much of the eyes of the stock market on cryptocurrency today. After quite a period of teasing and preparation the cryptocurrency trader is set to go public with an direct listing on the Nasdaq expected today. Its a huge moment for the legitimacy of cryptocurrency as Coinbase represents one of the most notable platforms in cryptocurrency exchange. It can be seen throughout the valuation of various crypto today, such as Bitcoin, which reached nearly $65,000 in valuation just ahead of Coinbases direct listing. Coinbases listing day on the Nasdaq takes place on April 14, 2021, as reported by the company itself This follows about a month after Coinbase was valued at around $68 billion in mid-March for its upcoming listing. While some experts in the financial sector claim that Coinbase may be overvalued due to the constant volatility and nature of cryptocurrency as a whole, many agree this a watershed moment for cryptocurrency, as reported by MarketWatch Nowhere can this be seen as more apparent than in the valuation of Bitcoin, which topped out at a high of $64,895 in valuation today ahead of Coinbases listing. Bitcoin value has been on the rise for a while, but it took another steep jump leading into Coinbase's direct listing on the Nasdaq on April 14. Now Bitcoins rising valuation isnt simply the work of Coinbase going public. The popular cryptocurrency has been rising in value for a while on a number of factors, not the least of which was Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musks public support of it as well as the Tesla companys move to invest in Bitcoinand begin allowing it as an acceptable currency for transactions. With these things considered, Bitcoin has actually been on the rise for quite a while. However, other cryptocurrencies are also experiencing growth which seem to coincide with Coinbases listing. Dogecoinin particular, long considered to be a meme currency, found its way to valuation of around $.10 a unitthis last week, which is notable to say the least. As Coinbase arrives on the Nasdaq today, it and all cryptocurrency values will be well worth watching. For major news and updates on the matter, stay tuned right here at Shacknews.

415,Latest Bitcoin price and analysis (BTC to USD),yahoo,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 13:49:42,"Bitcoin is currently trading at record highs of $64,500 as cryptocurrency fever spreads amid the listing of Coinbase on Nasdaq. Deutschlands grtes, kostenloses Online Casino. 200+ kostenlose Automatenspiele Benzinga J&J Covid Vaccine Pause Appears To Weigh On Airline, Casino, Hotel Stocks Early After a dull Monday, investors awake this morning to a couple of big news items. That being said, both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnsons (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. Well get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal, but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March, up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that its up isnt too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately, but its good to see its only a little above expectations. Thats in contrast to last Fridays producer price index, which came in way, way, above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJs Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isnt great news, obviously, but its nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer, and this might slow the momentum, but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also, people shouldnt think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine, but it isnt surprising that a complication got reported, simply because vaccines arent widgets. Like any medical product, theyre complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. Its a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted out of an abundance of caution. Its unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this, but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S., and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back, but in a worst-case scenario its off the market for an extended period, putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the reopening stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning were seeing shares of airlines, casinos, and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Streets attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure, a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear, but its nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile, volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62,000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up, but still below 17.5, which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless theres big news out of the FDA press conference, trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrows onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope, youre not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this years reopening darlings like airlines, energy companies, and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before todays JNJ vaccine news, remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news, with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products, which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday, but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while, the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industrys efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago, so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that, trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS), and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always, investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading, where theres often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season, FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1, so things are definitely looking up. In fact, the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will, 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called cyclicals like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop Theres always a caveat, and heres one: The Covid situation isnt really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend, telling 60 Minutes that hes concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course, there was todays bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing, watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators, and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment, FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1, led by Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Materials, and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results, and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue, too. Typically, analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season, so FactSet factors that in and says its more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end, FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6%",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/latest-bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-134942898.html

""Investing in cryptoassets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors' money,"" the FCA said. ""If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money."" It also means people should make sure they understand what they're investing in, the risks associated with investing, and any regulatory protections that apply, the FCA added. That's doubly true when most investments in Bitcoin take place in a way that mean Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) can't protect you in the way they can with normal savings and investments. A Bitcoin ATM at a shop (Image: SWNS) People should be particularly concerned about cold callers, the FCA said.

But that doesn't mean you can't buy Bitcoin safely. Since 10 January 2021, real UK cryptoasset firms have been registered with the FCA under regulations to tackle money laundering. That means there is a way to check they're legitimate. To help, the FCA produced a quick guide to the risks of investing as well as the ways to check you're buying from a legitimate provider. ""Consumers should be aware of the risks and fully consider whether investing in high-return investments based on cryptoassets is appropriate for them,"" the FCA said. ""They should check and carefully consider the cryptoasset business involved."" How to check a crypto firm is legitimate Step 1: Consumers should check if the firm they're using is on the Financial Services Register or list of firms with Temporary Registration (Note: appearing on the Temporary Registration Register does not mean that the FCA has assessed them as fit and proper, nor that the FCA has determined their application for the purposes of the Money Laundering Regulations). Step 2: If they're not on the register, consumers should ask the firm whether they are entitled to carry on business without being registered with the FCA. Step 3: If they're not registered, the FCA suggests that consumers should withdraw their cryptoassets and/or money. This is because the firm is operating illegally if it has not ceased trading by 9 January 2021.

417,Bitcoin Hits Record $1.2 Trillion Market Cap: Much Faster Than All Top Tech Giants,dazeinfo,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 12:12:09,"Fueled by consumers' rising interest in cryptocurrencies and institutional buyers, bitcoin has touched an all-time high value of a whopping $64,000 on Read more Fueled by consumers rising interest in cryptocurrencies and institutional buyers, bitcoin has touched an all-time high value of a whopping $64,000 on Wednesday, ahead of Coinbases IPO debut. Data from Coinmarketcap.comshows that an unprecedented rally of Bitcoin value has propelled its market cap over a whopping $1.2 trillion. What makes the achievement more significant is the duration it has taken to touch $1 trillion market cap. Bitcoins outstanding performance made the cryptocurrency taking far lesser timethan other mainstream financial assets to hit the $1 trillion milestone. Advertisements According to a study conducted by CryptoParrot, Bitcoin, the worlds most popular cryptocurrency, was able to reach this record peak in the span of mere 12 years only, while other large-cap U.S tech companies took way longer. Source: visualcapitalist.com Microsoft was 3.6x slower than BTC, as it took close to 44 years to get to $1 trillion. The Cupertino-based tech giant Apple took 42 years to achieve the same milestone while the U.S e-commerce behemoth Amazon Inc took 24 years and Alphabet-owned Google took 21 years. CryptoParrots report further highlights that even though the technology stocks have surged to a big extent from last year, none of them was able to match or outperform bitcoins growth trajectory. Thus, it is very much possible that in the near future, BTCs market cap will surpass that of other mainstream assets as well, given it has already sped past that of Tesla. Another research report by Glassnode, a blockchain data provider, said that bitcoin has held the $1 trillion market cap for more than a week. Therefore, it displays a strong vote of confidence for bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency asset class as a whole. It is important to note that bitcoin, at the beginning of 2021, had a more modest market cap of only $500 billion, but from thereon, it went to gain another $500 billion. Advertisements So, which were the key events that contributed to BTCs viral growth? Both Elon Muskand Jack Dorseymade sizable investments in bitcoin via Tesla and Square. Teslas 1.5 billion bitcoin investment is pegged to have reaped the company bigger profits than what it earned from its entire business in 2020. Canadian government regulators approvedmultiple bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds, aka ETF. Several ETFs were launched on the Toronto Stock Exchange, aka TSX. For many years, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBT) was the only investment vehicle accessible to investors. Last but not least, major payment processors such as MasterCardand Visa along with Bank of New York Mellon, made announcements about making it easier for their customers to use cryptocurrencies for making purchases. The skyrocketing value of Bitcoin has boosted the confidence of investors as well as traders despite possible backslash it may face in some of the largest markets. India, one of the largest markets, is reportedlylevying a heavy tax on Bitcoin exchanges and trading as well. Few either countries are also closely monitoring the market conditions before making their final move. It now remains to be seen how further and at what speed bitcoins market cap grows from here onward. We will keep you updated. Until then, stay tuned.

Do you think that the digital currency has a future, after all? Dec 21, 2013 at 11:14AM Dear readers, Let me tell you a little story. Once upon a time there was Bitcoin, a virtual currency that many people thought would change the way we think about money. But one day, China forced BTC, one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges worldwide, to stop accepting new fiat deposits. That was, more or less, the end of Bitcoin. And we lived happily ever after. Or not? Do you have another ending to this story? The December 2013 Meltdown Earlier this month, Bitcoin topped out at around $1,200, a move triggered mainly by all the hype that surrounded the recent Congressional hearing on virtual currencies. In a letter addressed to senators, Ben Bernanke gave his cautious blessing to Bitcoin, saying that virtual currencies may hold long-term promise. Instantly, this love-it-or-hate-it digital cash went through the roof. But when China's central bank scored a bull's eye on the crypto-currency by barring financial institutions and payment companies from handling Bitcoin transactions, a cloud on the horizon appeared. The oldest and largest Bitcoin exchange in the country was forced to stop accepting new yuan deposits. Bitcoin dropped like a rock and lost around 50% of its value. Frankly, I don't think this meltdown is that big of a deal. As Business Insider contributor Mark Williams aptly points out, ""in Bitcoin world, a week can be the equivalent of a decade."" I can't enumerate exactly how many times over the past four years Bitcoin took traders on a roller coaster ride by tripling in value, only to plummet a couple of weeks or even days later. Even so, this time is different because China  a global economic superpower  is standing up to it. And BTC China accounted for nearly one-third of the world's transactions denominated in Bitcoins. So, is this the beginning of the end for the world's most controversial digital cash? Bitcoin 'opponents' around the globe China is not the only country to frown on this decentralized crypto-currency. Regulators in Europe seem very keen on drafting new rules aiming at preventing virtual currencies from making their way into the mainstream. Last week, the European Banking Authority raised a red flag over the risks that stem from virtual currencies' extreme volatility and urged consumers to steer clear of them.

421,This Top Tech Investor Believes Bitcoins Will Beat Apple Pay -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 08:50:00,"Marc Andreessen believes bitcoins will eventually win out over Apple Pay in the next 20 years. But is he comparing apples to oranges? Mike Cauldwell Bitcoin is also the antithesis of fiat currencies, which have values set by the government, instead of being pinned to underlying assets like gold. Like a natural resource, there is a finite amount of bitcoins that can be digitally ""mined"" with an algorithm. This means bitcoins could become more dependable than even major currencies like the Russian ruble. Apple Pay is also ultimately limited to a single platform, iOS, while bitcoins can be transferred from nearly any Internet-connected device. Apple Pay is also fenced in by the legal boundaries of financial institutions and retailers, but bitcoin can cross international borders with ease. Why Andreessen might be wrong As of this writing, a single bitcoin is worth $216 -- down from over $1,100 in December 2013 but sharply up from around $4 in December 2011. That level of volatility makes it impossible to gauge their true value. Back in 2010, a Florida programmer paid for two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoins -- that would be worth a whopping $2.16 million today. Licensed exchanges like Coinbase might stabilize the price, but unless the annual gains or losses cool down to the single digits, it is hard to see businesses accepting bitcoin as readily as Apple Pay. Moreover, since retailers need to eventually convert bitcoin to local currencies, bitcoin ends up pinned to local currencies anyway. Apple Pay, while not as ""entirely new"" as Cook claims, still advances mobile payments to the next level by replacing cumbersome PIN codes with Touch ID on iPhones. On the upcoming Apple Watch, the PIN code only needs to be entered once, then remains active as long as the watch is worn by a single user. That big difference, along with a rising market share and the 220,000 stores that have adopted Apple Pay, ensure that it will fare better than earlier effortslike Google Wallet or Softcard. Apple Pay on the iPhone and Apple Watch. Source: Apple Apple Pay also offers a similar layer of anonymity as bitcoin, sending a token and dynamic number through the merchant network, instead of revealing credit card details. Add that to its Touch ID security, and Apple Pay arguably addresses data breach concerns just as well as bitcoin transfers. Why Apple wins by playing by the rules The ideology of bitcoin -- to declare independence from fiat currencies as a cryptocurrency without borders -- sounds revolutionary. Unfortunately, it is also prone to devastating hacks like Mt. Gox remains extremely volatile, and ignores user habits and retailer needs. By comparison, Apple Pay works by simplifying and securing mobile payments for users, addressing retailer needs, and inking partnerships with financial institutions. In my opinion, those steps will turn Apple Pay into a mainstream payment system as bitcoin remains a niche concept for hackers, programmers, and retailers seeking publicity Leo Sun owns shares of Apple and Facebook.

422,5 Factors That Could Cause Bitcoin's Bubble to Burst -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 07:38:00,"After more than quadrupling year to date, bitcoin's fun in the sun may be running out. ) Sep 14, 2017 at 8:38AM Traditionally, no investment has been able to hold a candle to the stock market when it comes to real wealth creation. However, cryptocurrencies aren't your traditional investment. This year alone, the aggregate market value of cryptocurrencies has soared by more than 800% surpassing $160 billion at one point, with bitcoin, the most consumer- and investor-facing digital currency of the group, nearly touching $5,000 per coin at the beginning of September after beginning the year below $1,000 a coin. While bitcoin's near quintupling might seem impressive, other cryptocurrencies, like primary rival ethereum, have risen by more than 3,500% year to date. Image source: Getty Images. Why digital currencies have been unstoppable in 2017 What's lit a fire under cryptocurrencies in 2017? Potentially the biggest catalyst has been the plummeting U.S. dollar, which recently hit a two-and-a-half year low. Generally, the dollar falls when uncertainty rises with regard to the U.S. economy. A lack of progress from the Trump administration in getting major legislation passed clearly has investors concerned that U.S. GDP growth forecasts may be a bit overzealous. When the dollar falls, the usual response from investors is to seek the safety of gold. Gold has been used as a currency for centuries, and it's a finite resource, which allows it to be a presumed store of value when the dollar is falling. However, in recent months, we've likely seen some investors choosing bitcoin as opposed to gold as their safe-haven investment. Bitcoin's protocol limits the number of coins that can be mined to 21 million, which itself makes bitcoin somewhat of a finite resource. The blockchain that a number of cryptocurrencies are based on, including bitcoin, could be another fundamental reason for this ferocious rally. Blockchain is a digital decentralized ledger that keeps track of all transactions. It's considered to be exceptionally secure, and some pundits believe it could be the future of peer-to-peer, client-to-business, and business-to-business transactions. In fact, more than 150 organizationsare currently testing versions of ethereum's blockchain in various pilot and small-scale programs in the financial and energy sectors, to name a few. Image source: Getty Images. If the bitcoin bubble bursts, one of these factors will likely be the culprit While the run higher in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has been game-changing, it's also feasible that bitcoin could be in bubble territory. After all, bitcoin's market cap has surged from roughly $3 billion in 2015 to nearly $69 billion as of Sept. 9, 2017. Though it's impossible to pinpoint what, if anything, could cause bitcoin's bubble to burst, the following five factors appear to be its most likely downside catalysts. 1. The emotional trading tide turns Perhaps the biggest risk for bitcoin is that the upside momentum wanes among retail investors and they lock in their gains. Because bitcoin is considered a nontraditional asset, most institutional investors have avoided taking a position in the digital currency. Thus, retail investors have been determining bitcoin's price -- and retail investors are considerably more prone to make decisions based on emotions rather than logic. It wouldn't take much to strike fear into bitcoin investors and send them scurrying for the exit. 2. Brand-name businesses ditch digital currencies, including bitcoin Another way bitcoin's bubble could burst is if brand-name and high-profile businesses suddenly decide that they don't want to accept the digital currency. Five brand-name businesses have accepted bitcoin since 2014 but if volatility in the currency grows, or if bitcoin's price were to suddenly falter, it's not out of the question that businesses could stop accepting bitcoin altogether. The fact that dozens of businesses accept bitcoin as payment adds to its legitimacy, so if businesses were to renege on their pledge to accept bitcoin, it could devastate what's often been described as a libertarian's dream currency. Image source: Getty Images. 3. Bitcoin's blockchain loses out to a competitor The bitcoin bubble could also burst if its blockchain turns out to be far less popular than envisioned by investors. As noted, ethereum already has an alliance of more than 150 organizations that believe its blockchain could be the next big thing. For what it's worth, bitcoin recently completed its SegWit2X upgrade that's designed to reduce transaction fees, improve transaction speeds, and increase capacity within its network (this upgrade is what precipitated the split of bitcoin into two currencies bitcoin and bitcoin cash). Will that be enough to attract businesses? It remains to be seen. 4. Bitfinex is hit by a major cyberattack If the largest bitcoin exchange were hit by a cyberattack, bitcoin could be in deep trouble. Currently, that title goes to Bitfinex, which, according to trading volume data found on WorldCoinIndex.com, shows it handles about half of all of bitcoin's volume in a given day. For those who may not recall, Mt. Gox at one time handled about 70% of bitcoin's trading volume before a cyberattack completely decimated the exchange. After bitcoin and cash were allegedly stolen by hackers, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy. This doesn't in any way suggest that Bitfinex is susceptible to cyberattacks to the same extent Mt. Gox was, but a debilitating cyberattack on Bitfinex, which could seriously hurt bitcoin's liquidity, can't be discounted. Image source: Getty Images. 5. Regulators crack down on bitcoin Finally, it's always possible that increased regulatory action could cause bitcoin's price to plunge. Unlike the other factors, this last point could potentially be a double-edged sword. You could rightly argue that increased regulation is a good thing since it would validate bitcoin as a currency and help keep bad folks from tarnishing the digital currency's reputation. Then again, increased regulation would be a major blow to libertarians who want zero government involvement in bitcoin. In other words, it could reduce interest in bitcoin, thus hurting its price. As noted, it's impossible to know with certainty if bitcoin is in a bubble. However, if my arm were twisted, I would indeed suggest the criteria for a bubble exists, and that buyers of bitcoin be fully aware of the major risks they're taking.

430,2021s top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest By BTC Peers,investing,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 00:00:00,"2021s top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest 2021s top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest The crypto derivatives market has grown by leaps and bounds in 2021, with digital assets exchange platforms reporting record-high trading activities. Notably, the growth of the derivatives market is exemplified by the growing demand for Bitcoin futures contracts. The global open contract, which was worth $3 billion back in January 2020, has surpassed the $22 billion mark, according to skew.com. With this in mind, it has become necessary to evaluate the explosiveness of the crypto derivatives market by analyzing the shares of digital asset exchanges using open interest as the standard measure. Note that we have opted for open interest metrics because it paints a clearer picture of trading activities and it provides an accurate means of measuring the flow of money into a derivatives market. Here are the top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest. OKExLaunched in 2017, OKEx remains one of the oldest and most reputable crypto exchanges. Over the years, OKEx has adapted to emerging trends and has continued to feature prominently in the top echelon of the crypto exchange market. The exchange offers traders a variety of ways to engage with the crypto market, including a budding derivatives market, and other crypto finance offerings. For the better part of 2020, OKEx emerged as the largest crypto derivatives exchange as a result of its competitive derivatives products and fees. With OKEx, traders can access perpetual contracts, futures, and options all on one platform. As a result, OKEx has maintained its high-flying status, regardless of the emergence of formidable competitors in 2021. According to data from The Block, OKEx accounts for 13.79% of global open interest for BTC futures worth over $3 billion and averages 24-hour futures open interest worth $4 billion. As such, it is currently the 3rd biggest Bitcoin futures exchange globally. BinanceBinance is popularly known for its strategic listings and relatively low fees. Remarkably, the exchange has managed to replicate this formula in its derivatives market to great effects. Earlier this year, Binance stamped its dominance in the BTC futures market by accounting for over $4 billion worth of open interest equivalent to 18.22% of the global tally. The 24-hour open interest of Binances futures is currently above $9 billion. One of the compelling selling points of Binance is its low trading fees set at 0.02% and 0.04% for maker and taker fees respectively. Also, traders get to access up to 125X leverage, depending on their affinity for risks. These features, combined with the established status of Binance in the spot trading market, have propelled its derivatives products to success. BybitBybit has carved a name for itself in the crypto derivatives market in just under 3 years of operations. The exchange currently averages 24-hour trading volume worth $20 billion and accounts for 15.66%, or $3.59 billion, of the global tally of open interest for BTC futures. At the time of writing, the 24-hour open interest of its futures market is around $4.3 billion. The rise of the Asia-based exchange in the global rankings indicates the growth of retail participation in the crypto derivatives market. 70% of Bybits clientele are reportedly retail traders while the other 30% are institutional accounts. Another propelling factor might be its referral program launched in January 2021. Bybit pays a $10 bonus to new and existing users participating in the referral scheme as part of its ongoing growth inducement strategies. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)Dubbed the ideal option for institutional investors interested in crypto derivative products, CME remains one of the contributing factors to crypto mainstream adoption. Its existing status in the traditional finance terrain has played a pivotal role in its growing dominance in the crypto derivatives market. The exchange momentarily emerged as the largest bitcoin futures exchange in December only to slip to 4th place following the explosive rise of the market shares of OKEx, Binance, and Bybit. It is also worth mentioning that the crypto derivatives trading activities recorded on CME reflect the demand for crypto products by institutional traders. However, this notion might become redundant in the coming months as CME plans to launch Micro Bitcoin futures suitable for retail clients. Huobi GlobalMuch like the exchanges listed above, Huobi delivers a wide array of trading options that are available globally. Huobis growing appeal boils down to its capacity to process high volumes of trades without worrying about slippages. It has ensured that this same high level of liquidity reflects in its derivatives market as the exchange records an average trading volume of $22 billion. Also, it has its standard maker and taker fees set at 0.02% and 0.04% respectively. In terms of open interest, Huobi ranks as the 5th largest Bitcoin futures exchange, according to the data from skew.com. The exchange currently boasts an open interest of $2.4 billion for BTC futures, representing 10.79% of the global Bitcoin futures market. DeribitDeribit is another high flyer in the emerging crypto derivatives market. Like Bybit, Deribit is one of the few prominent exchanges that focus solely on providing crypto derivatives products. Note that Deribit features just 33 Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives products. Nonetheless, it remains one of the most prominent options for both retail and institutional traders. Besides, the possibility of opening anonymous accounts makes it appealing to privacy-focused traders. According to Coingecko, Deribit processes over $1 billion worth of trading volume daily, thereby cementing its place in the top 10 list of crypto derivatives exchanges by volume. More importantly, it accounts for $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin-futures open interest and averages $1.8 billion 24-hour open interest. Therefore, Deribit is the 7th on the list of the top 10 bitcoin futures market and top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by open interest. FTXWith its 24-hour open interest averaging $5.2 billion, FTX provides sophisticated trading tools for over 150 perpetual and quarterly futures markets. Although it is a relatively new exchange, it has positioned itself for unprecedented growth by delivering consumer-centric and innovative products ranging from the basic to the highly technical. For example, Move, one of its derivative products, allows users to speculate on the daily, weekly, or even quarterly changes in the price of cryptocurrencies. As a result of FTXs penchant for innovation, the exchange has emerged as the 6th largest Bitcoin futures exchange globally, accounting for over 10% of the global bitcoin-futures open interest of $22 billion. BitmexOnce the largest crypto derivative exchange, Bitmex excelled as one of the long-standing privacy-focused crypto derivatives markets available globally. However, due to the increased regulatory scrutiny, Bitmex has begun to enforce KYC require",http://investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/2021s-top-10-crypto-derivatives-exchanges-by-open-interest-2473837

438,"Nothing meaningful: Niche ISP bashes Cable, BTC offers",tribune242,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 19:15:11,"The Bahamas Telecommunications Company (BTC) and Cable Bahamas have been accused of doing nothing substantial or meaningful to lower charges levied on niche providers for using their networks. Tribune Business Editor nhartnell@tribunemedia.net The Bahamas Telecommunications Company (BTC) and Cable Bahamas have been accused of doing nothing substantial or meaningful to lower charges levied on niche providers for using their networks. Theofanis Cochinamogulos, chief executive of Wicom Bahamas, responding to a consultation on the pricing and commercial terms the two communications giants must offer to small, niche Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as himself, alleged that their respective failures to undertake the necessary technology upgrades is a cost now being carried by the Bahamian economy. Signalling that he was unimpressed with both companies opening Direct Internet Access (DIA) offers, Mr Cochinamogulos said: We are of the view that nothing substantial or meaningful was done by either BTC or Cable [Bahamas] to reduce prices. The suggested prices can not be profitably sold by WISPs (wireless Internet service providers) or ISPs. The profit withdrawals by owners over the years, and poor quality of investments by BTC and Cable, while failing to upgrade obsolete technology, is now a cost being carried by residential and commercial operations in The Bahamas. It would be unfair for URCA not to use best competition price modelling to allow small ISPs better prices given the history of declining DIA prices and the significant contribution to GDP of internet penetration. Mr Cochinamogulos previously argued that wholesale direct Internet access rates charged by the BTC and Cable Bahamas are in excess of 150 times greater than comparable US prices and squeezing out competition, suggesting there was little rationale for these elevated costs with prices not having changed for ten to 15 years. The Utilities Regulation and Competition Authority (URCA) launched the consultation in a bid to ensure BTC and Cable Bahamas provide truly competitive access to small ISPs, who want to use the duos networks to offer wholesale Internet services to their own customers, but otherwise fear being squeezed out by pricing and practices that have already been criticised for being anti-competitive. BTC says it is offering a 21 percent discount to what it charges its own retail customers for using its network infrastructure, while Cable Bahamas has also unveiled its own offer based on the megabits per second desired by smaller ISPs. In unveiling the BTC and Cable Bahamas offers, URCA said BTC planned to levy both non-recurring and recurring charges on niche ISPs wanting to use its network to provide wholesale broadband Direct Internet Access for their own clients. The monthly recurring charges (MRC) are based on the retail minus approach, representing a 21 percent discount on the monthly price of BTCs retail DIA product, URCA said. The non-recurring charges (NRC) for all wholesale DIA products include installation and equipment charges, and are determined on a case-by-case basis. Cable Bahamas, too, is offering a structure involving recurring and non-recurring charges. The monthly recurring charges (MRC) are based on Cable Bahamas costing analysis of wholesale DIA services, URCA added. The non-recurring charges (NRC) for all wholesale DIA products include installation charges. They are determined on a case-by-case basis (based on a field survey). Comparisons between the two offers are difficult based on the information made available by URCA, as BTCs figures are based an all-in price that includes installation and equipment costs whereas Cable Bahamas only breaks out the monthly recurring charge. For niche ISPs seeking a speed of 500 Mbps, BTCs all-in cost is $18,466 per months while Cable Bahamas recurring monthly cost is $11,853. For one GigaByte per second (Gbps), BTCs all-in monthly cost is just under $37,000, while for Cable Bahamas it is $23,514. However, the latters figures do not include installation and equipment costs, making comparisons somewhat meaningless. URCA has moved to regulate the wholesale DIA market after finding that both Cable Bahamas and BTC have what it refers to as significant market power in this segment. Left unchecked and to their own devices, the fear is that the duo could use the dominance created by their national network infrastructure and stronger balance sheets to squeeze out weaker rivals via anti-competitive practices. Such a development could harm the interests of Bahamian business and individual consumers, especially since Internet access at competitive prices has become vital in the modern economy even before COVID-19.

He was approved by the U.S. Senate with a final tally of 53-45. Gensler did not face much opposition throughout the proceedings. Although Republicans made comments concerning the US capital markets as part of general objections to President Bidens plans to include issues like climate change under the SECs purview, Genslers credentials were well acknowledged. Back in March, he received a 124-10 committee vote. Speaking of his credentials, Gensler served as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during Obamas era. As head of the agency, he spearheaded the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. Subsequently, he taught classes on blockchain technology and digital assets at MIT. In the wake of his confirmation, the existing commissioners of the agency congratulated Gensler. A warm congratulations to Gary Gensler on his Senate confirmation to become Chair of the SEC. He will be joining a dedicated staff that works tirelessly day in and day out on behalf of investors and our markets. We welcome him back to public service and look forward to working together to execute our vital mission.
