That will impact its price obviously. Mining could be banned too in western countries. But bitcoin won't disappear. Its attractiveness will be diminished tho.

2021-03-12 10:50:16,@jonathanmoskal @francispouliot_ The cash flow isn't the problem. It's the purchase price of the asset itself that's the problem. It has a store of value premium that increases It's price.  As those assets on the margin get sold to redeploy to bitcoin it will put downward pressure on the price.
