World oil consumption  Graph showing the WTI crude price over the past 3 years (from March 2018-2021) (Source:OilPrice.com) By Robert Downey| Guest columnist March 14, 2021 at 3:41 p.m. Crude oil prices are rising again, as OPEC+ has kept their production constrained, while U.S. oil production has been declining, and world oil consumption is steadily rising. World oil consumption is back up to 95 million bbls/day and is projected to get to 99 million bbls/day over the next 12 months. WTI crude price is now about $65/bbl, up from $36/bbl on Oct. 25, 2020. OPEC+ will likely moderate the price to keep it in the $70-$75/bbl range over the next 2-3 years. Our domestic oil industry has two large segments, public and private companies; public company stocks have been taking a beating for the past several years and they will get stronger but will exercise capital spending discipline and focus on debt reduction and improving dividends. Private companies in the big shale oil plays are dominated by PE (private equity) backed firms that have for the most part either lost money or have very poor returns, so the PEs wont be providing any more capital to drill more wells until they can recover and finally capture good returns on their earlier investments  there are some exceptions to this in the Permian Basin, but places like the Denver-Julesburg Basin likely wont see development. Democrats almost always do things that cause oil and gas prices to rise, and Biden is already doing things like restricting oil and gas leasing of federal minerals, stopping pipelines, etc. They are planning a bill to raise the mineral royalty on federal oil and gas leases by 50%, from 12.5% to 18.75%. Biden will likely ban fracking on federal lands, too. It costs about $200,000 per well to get a permit to drill a well on federal minerals, and about two years for the permit to issue. Every affected federal agency reviews the permit, and NEPA requires either an EA (Environmental Assessment) or and EIS (Environmental Impact Statement) approval to issue permits to drill. The process requires several public hearings, and public notices, that attract all types of environmental groups and leftist activists that dont have a clue about energy, but hate oil and gas. SB 181, and the COGCC having been turned into an environmental group by Governor Polis, have made the Colorado oil and gas industry radioactive for private equity investors. They wont invest here, and those that did several years ago are stuck with underperforming assets. Weve seen consolidations, like HighPoint and Bonanza Creek, two publicly traded companies; others go into bankruptcy, like Extraction; and some private company mergers. There is not much new drilling activity, and where it has occurred is in Weld County. None of the other DJ Basin counties are friendly to oil and gas  Boulder, Adams, Jefferson, Larimer, Broomfield, even Arapahoe. This isnt going to change. The oil industry had several opportunities to get legislation passed to prohibit surface development from encroaching on oil and gas production, but didnt. Now they are stuck with a regulatory agency that wants to shut them down by regulating them to death and slowing or stopping the permitting of new wells; and public sentiment based on poor understanding of the inherent value of oil and gas minerals and impacts on their development. The 2,500-foot setback rule that COGCC recently passed is a good example, and it is going to prevent a lot of oil and gas from being developed. The Colorado oil and gas industry, API and COGA failed to lobby for an amendment to that setback, to prevent surface development within 2500 feet of an existing oil or gas well, when they had the opportunity. About the only thing that might slow down the continual addition of more and more regulations preventing development is mineral owners suing governments for illegal taking. John and Valerie Wells, represented by the Public Trust Institute, are suing the city of Boulder for taking their minerals by continually slapping moratorium after moratorium on oil and gas well permitting (Scott Weiser, Complete Colorado 2/13/2021) If other mineral owners would join them in a class action suit, and perhaps expand the suit to include Boulder County, who has been doing the same thing, they might help responsible oil and gas development to occur. However, the leftists that control our state and county, and some city governments, as well as ignorant people who dont understand oil and gas or other forms of energy, will use their government control and social media pressure to keep oil and gas development to a minimum, and the companies that are here will continue to have an increasingly difficult time. Those companies that have acreage in less populated areas of Weld County may fare better, but those having leases in other counties are going to have a hard time. If Weld County could leave Colorado to join Wyoming, it would make a huge difference to oil and gas development, as Wyoming supports and encourages responsible minerals development. Wyoming would benefit immensely, not only from oil and gas but also from agriculture; people forget Weld County leads Colorado in agriculture, too. Wyoming has no state income tax, so Weld County citizens would benefit from lower taxes, and a state government that is friendly to minerals and agriculture development.

Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujn both urged the Biden administration not to make its pause on new oil and gas leases on federal lands permanent. Work continues to preserve NM's oil and gas industry Dale Janway View Comments We have received several updates related to concerns over President Bidens Executive Orders enacting a temporary moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal land. According to a March 10 Politico article, New Mexico Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujn both urged the Biden administration not to make its pause on new oil and gas leases on federal lands permanent. The Senators wrote that ""an extended and indefinite suspension would have significant impacts on our workforce and state funding for education and creates unnecessary uncertainty for New Mexico's state and local tax revenues and made similar comments during the confirmation hearing for Secretary of Energy Sec. Granholm, when they pointed out the thousands of New Mexican jobs on the line. Senator Lujn also sent a similar letter to the City of Carlsbad and reached out to me directly. While we certainly will continue to have differences of opinion, we do sincerely appreciate his direct outreach. We also met with Representative Yvette Herrell several weeks ago to discuss this issue. Representative Herrell has issued a number of letters to both the U.S. Department of Interior and the State of New Mexico, expressing a number of concerns, including many over the suspension on the approval of derail oil and gas permits, leases and rights-of-way, among other things. This order has created great uncertainty and made day-to-day operations much more difficult for oil and gas producers operating on federal lands, Herrell wrote. Both Senators have also pushed for additional clarity on the executive orders as well. Additionally, New Mexico Gov. Lujan Grisham recently joined a group of governors from western, oil-producing states in voicing their concerns with a March 1 letter calling on the Biden administration to consider the specific issues in oil-producing states when enacting energy policies. Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies that rely on federal land disproportionately affect western states, given the high percentage of federal lands in western states, the governors wrote. We do not want to see a shift of jobs and energy activity to other states or nations that may not have enacted the strong environmental standards adopted by many western states. We were also informed that the governor made similar statements to the Department of Interior in a conversation on March 11. Rep. Herrell has also proposed the Protecting Our Wealth and Energy Resources bill, which would prevent the President from prohibiting leases on federal lands without the approval of Congress and withdrawing federal lands from mineral development without the approval of Congress. She has urged other elected officials to work to convince President Biden that such moratoriums are harmful. Our state is facing an economic and financial crisis if we do not act, Herrell wrote. We are glad to see elected officials from all western states pushing back against these unhelpful executive orders.",https://www.currentargus.com/story/opinion/columnists/2021/03/14/work-continues-preserve-nms-oil-and-gas-industry/4680665001/
2,Oil and gas industry touts value of Permian Basin production,currentargus,"Mar 14, 2021",2021-03-14 12:21:00,"Activists worried all that economic opportunity in the Permian Basin could come at a high environmental price New Mexico could be unable to address. View Comments The Permian Basin in southeast New Mexico could be one of the most prolific oilfields in the world and see some of the direst environmental threats throughout the Land of Enchantment. A recent study from the Permian Strategic Partnership(PSP)  a group comprising of oil and gas industry leaders and local stakeholders in the region  reported the basin contains more than 92 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and enough natural gas to meet U.S. household energy needs for the next 60 years. Operations in the region could contribute more than 18 percent of New Mexicos gross domestic product (GDP), the study read, and 11 percent of Texas GDP. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. Chairman of the PSP Don Evans, who also served as U.S. commerce secretary under former-President George W. Bush, said the Permians viability was always known and increased investments in infrastructure were needed to fully capitalize. The regions vast reserves solidify the Permian Basin as a global leader in energy and will ensure Americas energy security for decades to come, Evans said. Proper infrastructure investments are critical to the future productivity of the Permian and the extraordinary economic benefits it provides. The study released on Sept. 11 used new data from the Texas A&M University System finding that despite market volatility brought on by the COVID-19 public health crisis  which led to an historic decline in oil prices and industry operations  the Permian could still provide benefits to New Mexico and Texas. More: Joe Biden plan to end federal oil and gas leasing could 'devastate' New Mexico, study says PSP Chief Executive Officer Tracee Bentley said that as the pandemic subsides, the regions oil and gas industry will continue to sit as a major economic driver, pointing to $4 billion in tax revenues and royalties contributed by the industry toward state education funds in 2019. The Permian Basin has positively impacted every community in Texas and New Mexico, she said. The regions energy industry provides good-paying jobs with salaries well above the state average that support thousands of American families. Is it worth it? Activists worried all that economic opportunity could come at a high environmental price, and New Mexico regulators could be ill equipped to address the challenge amid increases in production. More: Permian Basin crude oil pipeline cancelled as market struggles to recover from COVID-19 Southeast New Mexico, per NMED data, reported some of the highest ground level ozone which is caused when volatile organic compounds  often released by oil and gas operations  interact with sunlight. A Wednesday study from environmental group Earthworksshowed the New Mexico Environment Department did not respond to 60 of 108 regulatory complaints filed by the organization in the last three years in response to perceived pollution caused by oil and gas operations in the Permian. NMED did recently begin issuing multi-million fines to oil and gas companies for air quality violations, with the most recent an about $7 million penalty filed against DCP Midstream and Energy Transfer Partners. More: BLM offers New Mexico public land for oil and gas, reports no impact on environment But Earthworks Field Advocate Nathalie Eddy said the recent commitments by New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state regulators to crack down on pollution would be impeded by a lack of staffing and resources. She said the state only had four environmental inspectors for oil and gas facilities in the Permian Basin and lacked a thermographer that could actively seek out sources of pollution in the oilfield. Earthworks uses forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras to create thermal imagining of possible excessive emissions by oil and gas operations that could be invisible to the naked eye. More: New Mexico finalizes oil and gas wastewater regulations, lawmakers hear testimony Eddy said the FLIR camera work done by Earthworks showed widespread air pollution throughout New Mexico and the Permian. That could be from leaking storage tanks or malfunctioning flares or valves. Eddy said only nine of the 108 complaints Earthworks filed resulted in emissions reductions. Where we go without cameras is driven by complaints and concerns from communities on the front line, she said. New Mexico communities are not protected from health concerns created by oil and gas. More: Oil and gas company opposed to nuke site near Carlsbad excluded from federal proceedings In total, the state in recent years under Lujan Grishams administration issued four letters of possible violations to operators in the Chaco Canyon area in northwest New Mexico and three in southeast region which contains the Permian Basin. But more work is needed to address the issue, Eddy said, as the basin holds up to 40,000 oil and gas rigs. Thats a significant step in the right direction, but a lot more needs to be done, Eddy said. A lot of it is because of the volume. The regulator isnt in the position to address the problem. NMED doesnt have the resources. I think there are some real commitments coming from the governor but how that plays out in the field, a disconnect remains. That disconnect exposes communities to harm on a daily basis. More: New Mexico researchers seek to map Delaware Basin aquifers, inform oil and gas permitting The alleged lack of government resources to address pollution put the onus on advocacy groups and local residents to hold the industry accountable, said Nadia Steinzor, manager of Earthworks community empowerment project and co-author of the study. Earthworks should not have to do the work of regulators in New Mexico, she said. NMED and the Oil Conservation Division both need far more resources to oversee the industry and live up to the current Administration's promises. Groups act against rollback of federal emissions rules Earthworks joined a group of 10 environmental groups in a recent lawsuit against the administration of President Donald Trump, protesting recent changes to the Environmental Protection Agencys regulation of oil and gas emissions. More: XTO Energy cancels plans for Eddy County oil and gas plant, group points to air pollution The changes were estimated by the groups to result in 3.3 million metric tons of methane pollution each year. The groups sought judicial review of two changes the EPA made to its rules that would limit the kinds of facilities to be monitored for excess emissions and limit the agencys ability to directly regulate methane  a major component of extracted natural gas. We see right through this appalling effort to hamstring future regulation of the oil and gas industrys methane pollution, said Liz Jones, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, a member of the coalition. As the world suffers record heatwaves, fires and storms, the last thing we need is deregulation of this super-pollutant to make our climate crisis worse.""

PTI March 14, 2021, 16:44 IST New Delhi: State-owned ONGC, which is often perceived as a drag on the crude oiland natural gasproduced in the country, has actually seen its contribution to the national production jump to over 70 per cent from under 53 per cent a decade back, petroleum ministrydata showed. While Oil and Natural Gas Corporation(ONGC) maintained production levels, output by other operators has dropped, leading to an overall fall in India's output and a sharp rise in import dependency. Its standalone production at 47.51 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gasin 2010-11 was 52.8 per cent of a total of 89.91 million tonnes of oil and gas produced in the country that year, the data showed. Despite having majority of fields where natural decline has set after being in operations for more than four decades, ONGC maintained production throughout the last decade thereafter and had an output of 44.57 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2019-20, which was 70.3 per cent of India's total production of 63.353 million tonnes. ONGC's output dropped to 43.54 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2015-16 (62.9 per cent of India's total production) but new discoveries as well as massive investment in extracting last drop from the ageing fields arrested further fall and even led to a marginal increase. Even when its production dropped when compared to previous year, ONGC's share in total production of crude oil and natural gas in the country continued to rise, the data which formed part of the review taken by the ministry a couple of weeks back, showed. ONGC is focused on finding oil and gas reserves in Category II and III Basins, which do not have established hydrocarbon proficiency. This helped accrete inplace reserves of 2,246 million tonnes of oil between 2002 and 2015 and ultimate accretion of 1,014 million tonnes, the data presented at the review showed. Of this, ONGC realised 830 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas as production. It has approved 14 schemes for developing 135 million tonnes of reserves. ONGC's share in national production rose from 52.8 per cent in 2010-11 to 54.9 per cent in the following year and to 58.7 per cent in 2012-13, 62.2 per cent in 2013-14, 62.3 per cent in 2014-15, 62.9 per cent in 2015-16 and 65.3 per cent in 2016-17. In subsequent years it was 67 per cent, 68.4 per cent and 70.3 per cent in 2019-20 -- the latest year for which data was presented at the review. During this 10-year period, India's dependence on imported crude oil to meet its demand rose from about two-third to 85 per cent. ONGC discovered and put to production seven out of the eight producing basins of India covering 83 per cent of established oil and gas reserves. In December last year, it opened India's eighth hydrocarbon producing basin when it started oil flow from a well in the Bengal basin.

4,Your turn: Oil and gas production ban could hurt New Mexico,demingheadlight,"Mar 14, 2021",2021-03-14 11:02:00,"""Your turn"" is a guest column format View Comments With election season in full swing, some politicians, notably presidential hopeful Joe Biden, think calling for a ban on future oil and gas leasing on federal lands will score points with some voters. But thats a losing approach for America's long-term energy security that puts customers and our economy in peril. In the early 1970s, Americans suffered from an oil embargo imposed on the U.S. by the Oil Producing Exporting Countries, commonly known as OPEC, because of the U.S.'s unwavering support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Americans of every rank and file were forced to wait in lines on designated days for hours on end just to fill their cars with gas. Five years later, Americans faced the same lines at the gas pump resulting from the dramatic decrease in oil production due to the Iranian Revolution. Because of these costly oil shortages, policymakers implemented measures to put the U.S. on the road to energy independence. Those measures included a 1975 ban on the export of crude oil, a diversification of the U.S energy portfolio (with even a Democratic president calling for coal use), and the implementation of a federal maximum speed limit of 55. Perhaps less known are the advancements in oil and natural gas exploration that were pushed to the forefront due to the Disco-Era oil scarcity. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, advances in such techniques as bidirectional drilling and hydraulic fracturing led to a doubling of U.S. oil production between 2011-2020. Despite these remarkable steps toward energy security, some are seeking to undermine this progress by banning the extraction of oil and natural gas on federal lands. What would this mean for the supply of affordable and reliable energy to American customers? One needs only to look to the fifth largest oil and natural gas-producing state  New Mexico  to answer that question. Unlike Texas, its massive oil-producing neighbor to the east, New Mexico extracts nearly half of its oil and 67% of its natural gas from leases on federal lands. Before the pandemic, tax revenue generated from oil and production overall comprised 20% of the states budget. That money is crucial to New Mexicos future, which is why Joe Bidens call for a ban on energy leases on federal land is so troubling. Its just one reason the Albuquerque Journal recently posed the question to Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Joe Biden ally, ""So is the Governor in favor of this (Federal leasing ban)? If it does happen, does she have a plan?"" The stakes are extremely high for New Mexico, which has one of the highest poverty rates in the country. Bidens potential ban could make that even worse. According to a recent American Petroleum Institute study, if the federal leasing ban were implemented, 62,000 jobs in New Mexico would be lost, accounting for over 5% of all jobs in the state. When coupled with the $1.1 billion loss in oil and gas revenue used to fund New Mexico's education and environmental stewardship programs, the threat of a federal leasing ban is economically cataclysmic. The evidence is clear. A ban on future federal oil and gas leases would be a dramatic step backward for the U.S. march towards more sustained energy security. It would also be deeply damaging to New Mexico. Its time for Joe Biden and others to abandon this bad idea and focus instead on using Americas abundant energy to recover from this pandemic.

5,"Industry, environmentalists criticize of state oil and gas methane rules",currentargus,"Mar 14, 2021",2021-03-14 09:45:00,"NMED and EMNRD were tasked with devising new rules to mitigate pollution and the effects of climate change under and executive order. View Comments New Mexicos proposed regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas facilities continue to meet criticism from environmentalists and industry leaders alike as the public comment period for the drafted rules ended last week. The State of New Mexico was working to create separate new rules on emissions within the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) and the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED). EMRNDs rules focused on eliminating waste from the emissions, particularly related to methane which is a valuable component of natural gas, while NMEDs rulemaking targeted specific reductions in pollution. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. The two agencies were tasked with devising new rules to mitigate pollution and the effects of climate change as part of the efforts of the Climate Change Task Force created by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham via executive orders in January 2019. But environmental groups argued the rules as drafted did not go far enough. A study commissioned by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) pointed to two categories of wells that would be exempt from the new rules, which for both agencies increased reporting and mitigation requirements for emissions from extraction facilities throughout the state. Sites with low-performing or stripper wells which produce less than 10 barrels per day or less than 60,000 cubic feet of gas per day, would be exempt from the rules along with sites with wells that have the potential to emit less than 50 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) per year. State officials asserted the exemptions were made to protect less economical wells and operations from prohibitive economic burdens that could be caused by the new rules. The EDFs analysis found 95 percent of producing wells in New Mexico fell into either of the two categories, so its cost analysis was conducted as if no exemptions were made to study if removing the exemptions would have an impact on New Mexico. The study conducted by Synapse Energy Economics evaluated the cost to the industry of implemented the proposed rules against the savings resulting from increased methane capture. It argued for the human health benefits of capturing more methane air reducing air pollution which could cause respiratory disease, heart disease and premature death, the study read. Such illnesses could from air pollution could also result in medical costs and lost wages, read the study Exposure to air pollution from fossil-fuel production and combustion can exacerbate human respiratory disease, cause heart attacks, and lead to premature death, the study read. Illnesses from air pollution can also result in other costs to society, such as medical costs and lost wages to treat and recover from the illness. When VOCs interact with sunlight, ground-level ozone can be created. Southeast New Mexico and the Carlsbad and Hobbs areas were recently reported as having some of the highest ozone levels in the state, far above the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of an average of 70 parts per billion ppb based on a three year average. The study estimated that with the expected levels of growth in Eddy and Lea counties, the areas could rise to more than 85 ppb and about 74 ppb respectively by 2021. Sustained exceedance of the NAAQS can result in increased federal intervention and oversight and can add additional requirements to permitting for oil and gas facilities. The study argued that NAAQS exceedance could stymie economic development, which could have a negative impact on the economy. If emissions are not brought down quickly, further measures may be imposed. These measures can impede economic development by requiring greater investment in pollution controls for expanded or new facilities, the study read. This process creates localized costs of doing business that could encourage development to happen elsewherein a different county of New Mexico or in another state entirely. Removing the exemptions would reportedly cause a reduction of 3 million tonnes of VOCs from 2020 to 2030, the study read, at a savings of $575 per tonne, and achieve at least $126 million in human health benefits. Avoiding an exceedance of the NAAQS would save up to $1.2 billion, per the study. If the exemptions were removed from the states methane regulations, $730 million worth of gas would be captured from 2020 to 2030, generating up to $99 million in revenue, the study read. The study also reported Such reductions in methane emissions would cause $12.3 billion in global climate benefits in the next decade. This study illustrates that, regardless of the perspective of benefits, the proposed oil and gas emissions rules are cost-effective without the exemptions for sites with stripper wells or wells with a potential to emit less than 15 tons per year of VOCs, the report read. But oil and gas industry leaders said the drafted rules as written went too far in restricting oil and gas operations and creating burdensome regulations. In comments submitted by the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA), the trade group argued the current draft of the rules would cost up to $4 billion, per a report NMOGA commissioned by economist firm John Dunham and Associates. In a letter to state regulators accompanying the group's public comments , NMOGA Executive Director Ryan Flynn argued the rules were too broad, and the industry should be allowed to develop its own emissions mitigation methods based on the unique characteristics of individual production sites. He said since 2011, the industry was able to reduce emissions by 50 percent while oil and gas production in New Mexico increased by 70 percent, relying on market-driven solutions. Flynn expressed some concern over stricter reporting requirements, which he argued could be costly and duplicative. Allowing flexible and efficient approaches will allow individual companies to assess their operations and prioritize projects, as necessary, for compliance, Flynn wrote. While NMED should have sufficient information to perform their responsibilities, including monitoring progress towards an established standard, the record keeping and reporting requirements must be reasonable and balance the cost of additional record keeping and reporting with the need to cost-effectively reduce emissions. NMOGA estimated that the rules, as written, would cause 4 percent of New Mexicos oil wells and 40 percent of the states natural gas laws to become uneconomical at a cost of more than $40,000 per well. The next phase of this process will offer regulators an opportunity to better align the rules with existing industry practices, technologies, and innovations, Flynn said. The performance-based standard could be enhanced by reducing prescriptive measures and promoting greater creativity and flexibility to allow operators to adapt and tailor their operations to the targets established by NMED and EMNRD.

6,Alberta inquiry into oil and gas foes could face legal challenge from Ecojustice,nationalpost,"Mar 14, 2021",2021-03-14 08:40:00,"CALGARY  An environmental law group is threatening legal action if the Alberta governments inquiry into foreign funding of oil and gas industry foes Alberta inquiry into oil and gas foes could face legal challenge from Ecojustice Back to video It is Ecojustices submission that the inquiry is ill-conceived, promulgated for purely political purposes and does not meet the test of expediency or being in the public interest, lawyers Barry Robinson and Kurt Stilwell write in the letter dated Tuesday. The $2.5-million inquiry in its current form is unlawful and potentially unconstitutional, they argue. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, often citing the work of Vancouver writer Vivian Krause, has repeatedly accused U.S. charities of bankrolling efforts to block Canadian energy in a concerted campaign of lies and defamation. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The inquiry is one plank of the United Conservative governments strategy to fight back against critics of Albertas oil and gas industry, which has struggled to get its product to markets as new pipelines are mired in delays. Ecojustice says in the letter theres a reasonable apprehension that the inquiry will be biased against the groups its investigating. It says Kenneys public comments  as well as the wording of the inquirys terms of reference  prejudge the outcome and label environmental campaigns as anti-Alberta. The group also says the inquiry risks violating rights to freedom of expression and association protected under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Ecojustice adds that the inquiry must be procedurally fair, meaning anyone called before it must be able to cross-examine witnesses and receive copies of documents submitted as evidence, among other things. Its proposing amendments to the inquirys terms of reference that would fix some of those issues. The public inquiry is meant to shed a spotlight on the foreign-funded campaign to landlock Alberta energy, Kenney said Wednesday. Why are these groups so agitated by that? What are they afraid of? What are they trying to hide? he said during a teleconference call from New York City, where he is promoting Alberta to U.S. investors. He said he hadnt read the Ecojustice letter, but added that it sounded like a regurgitation of the laughable letter from Amnesty International last week, in which the global human rights groups Canadian branch said it was deeply concerned with Albertas fight-back strategy. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content I understand why these groups are hyperventilating. They have been able, for over a decade, to engage in a systematic campaign to defame Albertas responsible energy production without transparency, without any pushback. The sort of letters were getting now  confirm that we are on exactly the right track. Kenneys press secretary later sent media a link to Ecojustices tax returns filed with the Canada Revenue Agency in which it discloses how much of its revenue comes from foreign sources. Last year, it received just over $1 million from outside Canada  about 14 per cent of its total annual revenue during the period. Allan, the commissioner, is a forensic and restructuring accountant with more than 40 years of experience. His ability to compel witness testimony and records is limited to Alberta, but Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer has said much of the information Allan needs is publicly available. Hell be able to travel outside Alberta to gather more. The inquirys first phase is to focus on fact-finding. Public hearings are to follow if necessary.

7,Group wants new agency to oversee oil and gas industry in British Columbia,nationalpost,"Mar 14, 2021",2021-03-14 08:06:00,"VANCOUVER  British Columbias Oil and Gas Commission isnt taking action that would protect the environment in the public interest, favouring instead the Group wants new agency to oversee oil and gas industry in British Columbia Back to video What we have seen over the more recent years is that the commissions job to ensure environmental protection and to ensure public health and safety and to ensure companies are following the rules, there is abundant evidence that the commission is failing to do that, he said in an interview. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources said in an email that its staff are in the process of reviewing the report. We have a strong provincial regulator in the BC Oil and Gas Commission and it, along with government, is always looking for continuous improvement for our regulatory framework, the email statement said. The commission didnt respond to requests for comment on the report released Wednesday by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. The centre is a think tank that does not take corporate donations. It describes itself as a source of progressive policy ideas and says its values are rooted in social justice and environmental sustainability.

Article content The report says that before the commissions genesis, companies had to apply to numerous provincial ministries and branches to obtain authorizations before drilling for natural gas could begin. These included the Forests Ministry, which issued permits to log forests for roads, pipeline corridors, well pads and more; the Ministry of Lands, which approved the occupation of Crown or public lands; the Heritage Conservation Branch, which issued archaeological permits; and the Environment Ministry, which handed out water permits and approvals governing industrial activities in sensitive fish and wildlife habitats, it says. Parfitt said after the commission was established in 1998 the review and approval of industry development applications accelerated. The very first reports showed the Oil and Gas Commission was speeding up the approval process but not the compliance process, he said. The report looks at three significant indications of where the agency has failed to be tough on the companies that it regulates. The report highlights examples of when the commission didnt penalize companies to the fullest extent for the construction of unlicensed dams, leaking gas wells, contaminating water and violations of rules to protect endangered species, Parfitt said. Those examples show there is an extreme reluctance on the part of the industry regulator to hold the companies it regulates to account, he said.

Article content There will be a significant ramp up in oil and gas industry activities once liquefied natural gas plants are built on the B.C. coast, which will lead to an increase in drilling and fracking, Parfitt said. He said theres been a reluctance on the part of one provincial government after another to deal with the Oil and Gas Commission. A different set of rules seems to apply for the fossil fuel industry, Parfitt said. To ensure compliance, the report recommends the creation of an arms length agency to oversee regulatory compliance and enforcement and that a single water authority be reinstated to regulate all water users in the province. The amount of drilling and fracking that is going to occur to supply those plants is going to result in a huge, huge increase in gas industry activities in the northeast of the province, Parfitt said. So, this is a time that we need to get things right in terms of regulating the industry. The report also says the provincial government should remove the commissions powers to change regulations and compel it to release all information that is in the public interest. At the end of the day, we still have to confront the fact that we still have a climate crisis in the world right now and we need to be finding a way to rapidly ramp down fossil fuel production in B.C. and around the world, Parfitt said.

9,Why $4-a-gallon gas may be coming your way this summer,seattletimes,"Mar 14, 2021",2021-03-14 06:35:00,"Energy prices could keep moving up as the economy recovers into the summer because oil and gasoline industry executives are resisting their usual impulse to pump more oil out of... *For a gallon of regular gasoline Source: AAA While overall inflation remains subdued, some economists are worried that prices, especially for fuel, could rise faster this year than they have in some time. That would hurt working-class families more because they tend to drive older, less efficient vehicles and spend a higher share of their income on fuel. In recent weeks oil prices have surged to more than $65 a barrel, a level that would have seemed impossible only a year ago, when some traders were forced to pay buyers to take oil off their hands. Oil prices fell by more than $50 a barrel in a single day last April, to less than zero. That bizarre day seems to have become seared into the memories of oil executives. The industry was forced to idle hundreds of rigs and throttle many wells shut, some for good. About 120,000 American oil and gas workers lost their jobs over the last year or so, and companies are expected to lay off 10,000 workers this year, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Yet even as they are making more money thanks to the higher prices, industry executives pledged at a recent energy conference that they would not expand production significantly. They also promised to pay down debt and hand out more of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. I think the worst thing that could happen right now is U.S. producers start growing rapidly again, Ryan Lance, chair and chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said at the IHS CERAWeek conference, an annual gathering that was virtual this year. Scott Sheffield, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas producer, predicted that U.S. production would remain flat at 11 million barrels a day this year, compared with 12.8 million barrels immediately before the pandemic took hold. Even OPEC and allied producers like Russia surprised many analysts this month by keeping several million barrels of oil off the market. OPECs 13 members and nine partners are pumping about 780,000 barrels of oil a day less than at the beginning of the year, even though prices have risen by 30% in recent months. The discipline to support higher prices is needed for the recovery of their economies, said Ren Ortiz, a former secretary-general of OPEC who is now Ecuadors energy minister, adding that many of the groups members needed higher oil prices to balance their budgets and service their debts. Their reserves have been drained. The decision to keep production restrained was principally the work of Saudi Arabia and its closest Persian Gulf allies and was a reversal of their position from just a few years ago. In late 2014, as oil prices began to sag as U.S. oil production surged, Saudi Arabia and OPEC cranked up production, sending prices plummeting. The cartel seemed to want to undercut drilling in U.S. shale fields, particularly in Texas and North Dakota. But the U.S. oil industry was far more resilient than Saudi officials expected, and U.S. production continued to rise as companies cut costs. While many shale companies were hurt by OPECs move and oil prices never completely recovered, the economies of Saudi Arabia and other oil-dependent nations were damaged far more than the United States. But the temptation to produce more when prices rise has not disappeared completely, especially for countries, like Colombia and Guyana, that want to pump as much oil as they can before rising concerns about climate change reduce the demand for fossil fuels in favor of electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Russia has been pressing Saudi Arabia to loosen production caps, while Kazakhstan, Iraq and several other countries are exporting more. Even Iran and Venezuela, which have struggled to sell oil because of U.S. sanctions, are beginning to export more. Some analysts expect that when OPEC and its allies meet again next month, they will allow more production, which could drive down prices. But for now, petroleum stockpiles are dwindling around the world as energy demand begins to recover. As always, tensions in the Middle East could determine what happens to oil prices. In recent weeks, drone attacks on energy facilities in Saudi Arabia sent shudders through oil markets. While Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed credit for the operation, the drones may well have been launched by Iran, which is allied with the rebels, according to Saudi security officials. The heating up of whats commonly understood as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Yemen is just adding to the bullish oil price fever, said Louise Dickson, a Rystad Energy oil markets analyst. Iraqi militias believed to be allied with Iran have also attacked U.S. military forces. Some tensions in the region could ease if the Biden administration and Iranian officials restart negotiations on a new nuclear agreement to replace the one that was negotiated by the Obama administration and abandoned by the Trump administration. Iran would then most likely export more oil. Of course, U.S. oil executives have little control over those geopolitical matters and say they are doing what they can to avoid another abrupt reversal. Were not betting on higher prices to bail us out, Michael Wirth, Chevrons chief executive, told investors last Tuesday. Chevron said recently that it would spend $14 billion to $16 billion a year on capital projects and exploration through 2025. That is several billion dollars less than the company spent in the years before the pandemic as the company focuses on producing the lowest-cost barrels. So far, these guys are refusing to take the bait, said Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at IHS Markit, a research and consulting firm. But he added that the investment decisions of American executives could change if oil prices climb much higher. Its far, far too early to say that this discipline will last.

Oil and gas industry leaders sought to allay economic concerns stemming from a historic decline in the market driven by the COVID-19 pandemic in addressing the Carlsbad community at the city's annual Energy Summit held Thursday at the Pecos River Village Conference Center. Before the pandemic, the Permian Basin led the nation in oil and gas production and activity in southeast New Mexico and West Texas. But in April, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a grade of crude oil used as a benchmark for domestic pricing, fell to about -$40 per barrel  the first time in history prices plummeted below $0 per barrel. The result was a collapse in Permian Basin activity as rig counts fell, wells were shut in and workers were laid off. Amid the downward trend, Private Equity Investment Manager at Chase Energy Billy Munn said companies in the Permian need to find new ways to operate during the lower-price market rather than waiting for a recovery that could be years away. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. He pointed to increases in the price of oil and gas leases up to $80,000 per acre as a driving force behind the industry becoming more and more expensive to operate. Its not that you dont have oil in the Permian, the question is what does it cost to extract it. More so now than any downturn Ive ever witnessed, this one is different, Munn said. Youve elevated the cost of acreage and the expense of extraction so high. Im cautious about shale. We throw around numbers that are enormous. Its not about pessimism or optimism out here. Its about what does it cost to do it. Munn said that when confronted with a lower-price market  as WTI was presently reported at about $40 per barrel per data from Nasdaq compared with more than $60 per barrel last year before the pandemic hit  companies must find new ways to profit. MORE: Permian Basin crude oil pipeline cancelled as market struggles to recover from COVID-19 That could mean capturing more natural gas as opposed to flaring it, and sending that resource to market to be sold, or seeking to use market produced water as research shows operators can generate up 10 barrels of water per barrel of oil in the Permian. Make something out of it, he said of excess natural gas. I have no doubt the people out here are tough. But sitting around hoping for $80 is not what you need to do. You need to work with what you have. Its not that we should be fearful of the future, but we should be looking at what do with what you have. We need to be responsible for our own economics of extraction, not advertise to the rest of the world how many barrels youve got. MORE: Joe Biden plan to end federal oil and gas leasing could 'devastate' New Mexico, study says Rick Cannon, manager of Delaware Basin production for XTO Energy said he was optimistic about the major oil producers position in the Permian both in New Mexico and Texas. Despite XTOs parent company ExxonMobil announcing in April that it had reduced its capital spending by 30 percent and lower operating expenses by 15 percent in response to the pandemic and market collapse, Cannon said the company plans to continue operations in the region and efforts to curb its environmental footprint through efforts such as emission reductions. He said ongoing operations in the region could allow XTO to capitalize on the markets recovery. 2020 has not gone according to anyones plans, Cannon said. While overall activities have reduced, were still very busy in the basin. Weve continued to maximize long-term value to put us in a strong position when the market recovers. MORE: Oil and gas industry, environmentalists voice criticism of New Mexico's methane rules President of Occidental Petroleums New Mexico operations Babatunde Cole said the company would continue to focus on projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions, touting a 96 percent reduction in flaring in the last two years. He said the company embraced new storage technologies designed to capture more carbon dioxide while also working to recycling more water with 25 million barrels of water recycled in 2019. In February, Occidental was the first U.S.  oil company to join the World Banks initiative to end routine flaring by 2030, a move Cole said typified the companys efforts at protecting the environment alongside profitable fossil fuel production. We have a lot of passion on low carbon projects. Were working to reduce our emissions, and help others reduced their emissions, Cole said. As with other companies, flaring is really important to Oxy. Weve taken steps to reduce our flaring. MORE: Oil and gas waste facility coming to Permian Basin; New Mexico continues work on produced water And during the uncertain economics plaguing the oil and gas industry during the pandemic and subsequent financial depression, Cole said Occident remained committed to the Permian Basin as its largest acreage holder and to the Carlsbad community. We are committed to the city of Carlsbad. We have invested in the city for a long time and intend to continue to do so, he said. We know there is a lot of uncertainty in the world right now, but one thing you can count on is Oxys commitment to the city of Carlsbad.

11,"Outlook: Oil and gas recovering after dark 2020, but it will take time",tulsaworld,"Mar 14, 2021",2021-03-14 06:30:00,"""Due to the incredible success the industry had through the drilling of horizontal wells ... when the COVID hit, it couldnt have been at a worse time,"" Dewey Bartlett Jr. At the onset of 2020, state officials and oil and gas company leaders were cautiously optimistic about the coming year for the industry. Then the pandemic hit. As lockdowns began and people started working from home and ending daily commutes in the collective millions of miles, the demand for oil and gas plummeted. Oil prices, which had already been declining at the start of the year, dropped to unprecedented lows  falling to a staggering minus $37 per barrel April 20  the first time prices had actually gone below zero and the worst day for the industry, perhaps in history. But since then, prices have steadily risen to more than $60 per barrel. The recovery, however, has just begun. Ive experienced some bad years, and Id say each one of the experiences has been precipitated by an outside problem. Certainly, COVID took the place of the outside problem, said Dewey Bartlett Jr., former mayor of Tulsa, president of Keener Oil and Gas and head of the Oklahoma Energy Producers Alliance. Due to the incredible success the industry had through the drilling of horizontal wells ... putting this country in a position to sell oil and natural gas  a position we had not been in in many many decades  when the COVID hit, it couldnt have been at a worse time. Its something that has never happened before, and it certainly was never anticipated, and hopefully, it will never happen again. Weve now seen tens of thousands of people lose their jobs. The horizontal (drilling) industry has stopped. Smaller companies have declared bankruptcy and have had to shut down. Even some of the large companies have had to declare bankruptcy. Theres been all kinds of terrible problems, Bartlett said. He said that even though the price of oil has come back up, policies by the new Biden administration  including halting construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and putting a moratorium on drilling on federal lands and offshore areas  could hamper recovery efforts. By simply getting rid of the supply, that does not mean youre getting rid of demand, Bartlett said. You have to buy from somewhere if we want to maintain our lifestyle. Driving cars, driving trucks ... and making plastics, clothes ... drugs  all of those things come from oil and natural gas in a processed way. However, Bartlett said that with other oil and gas drilling areas becoming off limits, it could actually benefit Oklahomas producers. It could be that there could be an increased demand for Oklahoma crude oil. Some places will be off limits for new drilling, so ... Oklahomas a great place to continue that opportunity, he said. Bartlett said three things have to happen for the industry to fully recover: People need to start driving like they were before the pandemic; the transportation industry, particularly trucking, needs to return to normal; and airline flights will need to approach returning to normal to allow the airline industry to recover. All three of those activities are going to have to have very significant improvement, he said. It will be a while. Were now beginning to see the market reflect the optimism that we are seeing a recovery, Bartlett said. He said $60 per barrel for oil is not a price that is going to make everybody extremely happy. But at least its at a level where oil and gas companies can operate their wells somewhat profitably. Bartlett said that even if oil continues to climb to say, $80 per barrel, it will depend on how long prices remain at that level to have a significant effect on the industry and the return of many jobs that were lost. It depends on how long it stays there, he said. But if it drops into the $40s again, its stagnant city. Here we go again. According to a U.S. Energy Information Administration report in February, a return to 2019 levels of U.S. energy consumption will take years. The ups and downs  its not necessarily a new experience, Bartlett said. Its not a fun experience. But its something the older companies are prepared for. I think it will get back eventually. Tom Seng is professor of energy business and director of the School of Energy Economics, Policy & Commerce at the University of Tulsa. He said Tulsa is in a relatively stable position because most energy companies here specialize in transporting and storing oil and gas and that many companies who produce it have relocated years ago. Exploration and production companies, he said, they have 100% commodity exposure. With all of the midstream and downstream (storage and transportation) companies here, its much more stable in the long run. While 2020 was an unprecedented year for the industry, it still remains a significant part of the local and regional economy, Seng said. Youre still talking about thousands of employees. These have always been very good-paying jobs. Tags",https://tulsaworld.com/outlook-oil-and-gas-recovering-after-dark-2020-but-it-will-take-time/article_97d438f4-7234-11eb-bb56-af8d58292a59.html
12,Oil and gas permits challenged as Permian Basin ozone levels rise,currentargus,"Mar 14, 2021",2021-03-14 04:46:00,"From 2017 to 2019 Eddy County recorded an average of about 79 parts per billion (ppb) of ozone, records show, while the NAAQS was set at 70 ppb. View Comments Environmentalists argued that no new permits for oil and gas facilities in southeast New Mexico that could contribute to ozone concentrations in the region should be issued by the State of New Mexico during a two-day hearing with state environmental officials. The States Environmental Improvement Board  an arm of the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED)  heard arguments from WildEarth Guardians (WEG) appealing the issuance of general construction permits (GCPs) for facilities in the area to 3 Bear Delaware Operating, XTO Energy and Spur Energy. No decision was made by the Board, which would open a 30-day period for post-hearing submissions after a transcript of the hearing was made available before making a final ruling. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. WEG argued that air monitoring in Eddy County showed ground level ozone levels in exceedance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) that could lead to a federal designation by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an area of non-attainment of the standard. From 2017 to 2019 Eddy County recorded an average of about 79 parts per billion (ppb) of ozone, records show, while the NAAQS was set at 70 ppb. The alleged violation WEG argued, should broadly prevent NMED from issuing permits for facilities that could contribute to continued ozone increases in the area. More: New Mexico Environment Department's ozone air monitor in Carlsbad shut down for most of July During the hearing the Board entertained two separate appeals made by WEG: one for 3 Bears Libby Gas Plant, and a second for three facilities owned by Spur and XTO. All four facilities were in Eddy and Lea counties. In his opening remarks, WEG attorney Daniel Timmons questioned NMEDs actions in continuing to issue air quality permits to facilities he said would continue to add to southeast New Mexicos ozone problems. State officials argued that the facilities at issue were deemed minor emitters of ozone precursors under the permits and thus could not by definition be considered as contributors to violations of air quality standards. More: Oil and gas industry, environmentalists voice criticism of New Mexico's methane rules Industry representatives argued that the EPA had not yet designated the area as non-attainment and it was outside of the NMEDs authority to do so and deny oil and gas permits on that basis. In a statement from XTO Energy, the company argued that the area where it was permitted to build the facility in Eddy County was not designated as a non-attainment area by the EPA so the limitations suggested by WEGs appeal did not apply. The general construction permit allows construction except in non-attainment areas. The XTO permitted facilities will be located in Eddy County, which is currently designated by U.S. EPA to be in attainment with the 2015 Ozone NAAQS, the statement read. So, the limitation in the permit does not apply at this time. WEGs issues are and will be addressed in rulemaking required by the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act. NMED has initiated that process. Should ozone readings block oil and gas? The monitoring data for Carlsbad, Hobbs, and Carlsbad Caverns is all very clear on this point, and neither the Department nor any of the intervenors dispute this, Timmons said. Yet despite acknowledging the regions ozone problem, the Department continues to issue new permits allowing more and more emissions of ozone precursor pollutants, making the situation worse. At the 3 Bear facility, Timmons contended that its expected emissions of 72 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 21 tons of nitrous oxide (NOx) per year would contribute to ozone levels already exceeding federal standards. More: XTO Energy cancels plans for Eddy County oil and gas plant, group points to air pollution Ground-level ozone is a pollutant that can be formed when VOCs interact with sunlight, known to cause respiratory illness and other health concerns in humans. The emission levels permitted at the 3 Bear facility, Timmons argued, were an example of NMED continuing to allow air pollution in violation of federal standards and state law which he said precludes the NMED from issuing any permit that will cause or contribute to an exceedance of the federal NAAQS. He said the 3 Bear permit was illegal and should be vacated. More: BLM offers New Mexico public land for oil and gas, reports no impact on environment Despite a lot of hand-waving, Department (NMED) does not dispute that these emissions are likely to increase ambient ozone levels in the area, he said. While the Departments excuses continue to shift, it has not disputed the basic fact that adding new emissions of VOCs and NOx increases ozone levels. Allowing new emissions undoubtedly makes this problem worse. Timmons said the NMED should address the regions ozone problem by rescinding the questioned permits and refusing to issue any new permits for facilities in the area. More: New Mexico fines DCP Operating Co., Energy Transfer Partners $7 million for air pollution At core, theres no dispute that ozone pollution is a serious problem and public health threat in southeastern New Mexico, and the Departments continued issuance of new permits and registrations is making this problem worse, he said. Instead of addressing this problem head-on, the Department points to scientific complexities, legal technicalities, and possible future rules that are not yet on the books. Lara Kats, NMED assistant general counsel said the Department did not have the authority to deem an area as non-attainment despite the monitor readings. More: New Mexico oil and gas methane regulations criticized for 'loop holes' She said NMED did not have the right to deny permits based on the readings alone, and that to do so would upend the departments permitting policy and it could face litigation if the Board ruled in favor of WEG. Wildearth guardians approach would upend the departments air quality permitting program and leave New Mexico alone in uncharted waters when it comes to determining what constitutes a non-attainment area for ozone and what consequences flow from that determination in terms of whether and in what circumstances combustion sources in those areas can be permitted, Katz said during the hearing. If the board decides in WEGs favor it will have major ramifications for the departments programs and resources. More: Trump admin. curbs federal oil and gas emissions standards. Here's where New Mexico stands NMED Air Quality Bureau Chief Elizabeth Bisbey-Kuehn pointed to NMEDs recently enacted ozone attainment initiative aimed at reducing ozone concentrations in areas with high levels of the pollutant through rulemaking processes and public outreach. She said the permits were property evaluated and issued per state law, and that many sources of ozone precursors in New Mexico were located in Texas which the NMED has no authority to regulate.

More: Joe Biden plan to end federal oil and gas leasing could 'devastate' New Mexico, study says U.S. oil exports up, fossil fuel market creeps upward The investment comes months after a recent historic decline in the oil and gas market brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and slumping fuel demands, as oil and gas companies seek to put themselves in strong positions to capitalize on the prolific Permian Basin as global fuel demand gradually recovers. In April, the health crisis led to the price per barrel of domestic crude to plummet to about -$40 per barrel, the first time prices had fallen below $0 per barrel in history. The price per barrel of domestic crude was reported at about $39 per barrel, per data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and was expected to rise above $41 per barrel by March 2021.

But the market did see some support through exportation as U.S. crude oil exports averaged 3.2 million barrels per day in the first half of 2020, the EIA reports, up from 2.9 billion in the first half of 2019. This increase was led by exports to China, read the report, which grew by 213,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2019 to an average of 361,000 barrels per day in first half of 2020. More: Oil and gas waste facility coming to Permian Basin; New Mexico continues work on produced water Exports to China continued to increase in the spring and early summer with 1.3 million barrels per day in May and another 700,000 in June, read the report, making China the largest destination for American crude during those months. Meanwhile, the U.S. oil imports saw declines this year as more oil was produced domestically as fuel demands declined. During the first half of 2020, U.S. crude oil imports averaged 6.2 million barrels per day, the report read, down 12 percent compared with the first half of 2019. More: Oil and gas waste facility coming to Permian Basin; New Mexico continues work on produced water Monthly imports declined significantly in April, when prices saw the biggest decline, but increased in May and June, read the report led by imports from Saudi Arabia which increased from 400,000 barrels per day in April to 1.2 million barrels per day in both May and June. The increased imports from Saudi Arabia followed a spike in its oil production, the report read, due to the expiration of production cut agreements from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The countrys crude oil production rose to 11.6 million barrels per day in April, the highest level reported by the EIAs monthly data since 1993. More: BLM offers New Mexico public land for oil and gas, reports no impact on environment But as OPECs new production cuts went into effect, U.S. oil imports from Saudi Arabia fell to 513,000 barrels per day in July and 311,000 barrels per day in August as the countrys output declined. Robert McEntyre, spokesman for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association said investments during the low price environment experienced by the oil and gas industry would better prepare operators for the markets ultimate recovery. Prices seem to be responding to some of the production curtailments since early spring.

14,Jon Mark Hogg: Trump no friend of oil and gas,gosanangelo,"Mar 14, 2021",2021-03-14 01:19:00,"Jon Mark Hogg is the Democratic Party candidate for Texas 11th Congressional District. August Pfluger: Texas energy needs Trump. He needs us too President Trump is no friend of oil and gas.  He had no concern for it before the pandemic and has no plan to help it now. During his recent Odessa visit, he took credit for stopping the free fall into negative territory of the price of oil. He acted like that was all there was to it and expected every company to just start up again. He hasnt said one word about addressing commodity prices since.  In his speech in Odessa, he also forgot the crash was in large part a result of his long standing policy of keeping oil prices artificially low. Stewart Doreen detailed the Presidents low oil price policy in the Midland Reporter Telegram on March 9, 2020.  In that short article he documented the Presidents comments and tweets going back to April 2018 pressuring Saudi Arabia and OPEC to increase production and keep the price of oil low. At one point the President even complained that $54 bbl was too high and that the Saudis should bring it lower. Doreen also highlighted the Presidents discounting of the threat posed by a global pandemic on the demand for oil.  Five weeks later, oil went negative for the first time in history.  Belatedly, and only under intense pressure from the oil industry, Trump became interested in helping prop up the price of oil because he knew it could cost him re-election if he didnt.  With friends like that, who needs enemies? Throughout his presidency President Trump has shown a complete disregard for the implications of his disastrous economic, foreign and public health policies on the price of oil and the energy industry.  Trump and his followers like to throw around the phrase energy independence while at the same time consistently failing to take the basic steps we need to achieve and maintain it. Steps like advocating for higher commodity prices. In fact, they pursue policies that have the exact opposite effect. It is time for a new course. Millions have been spent trying to convince us the election of a Democratic President would be the end of the oil and gas industry.  Nothing is further from the truth.  History has consistently shown that oil and gas commodity prices do better under Democratic administrations than Republican ones  and you dont have to go that far back to see it.  Oil prices have gone negative only once in the history of the industry, and Joe Biden was not even a nominee when that happened.  West Texas should deny Donald Trump a second term for this reason alone. What we need is not platitudes and empty words but a vision for the future of energyone that proactively seeks to keep the price of oil high enough and stable enough to maintain reasonable production levels, incentivizes new developments and technology to use oil and gas cleaner and more efficiently, and that actively promotes development of new technologies and cleaner renewable sources of energy, all at the same time. The argument that we are limited to choosing between oil and gas and preserving and improving our natural environment is a false choice. Do not accept it. Oil and natural gas are essential resources we need to fuel our economy today. This includes using all production technology at our disposal, including fracking. It has been my privilege to represent the interests of oil and gas companies, as well as land and royalty owners in West Texas throughout my legal career.  It is in the interest of all that this industry thrive  not just for our present needs  but for tomorrow. Natural gas in particular is what enables us to power our nation cleaner than we ever have before.  It also provides the energy we need to develop new technologies and renewable sources of energy. Texas already leads the nation in both oil and gas and renewable energy production.  Who better than Texas to lead in creating a long term national energy policy that includes both?  We support todays oil and gas industry, promote its health and the jobs it provides. At the same time, we must also envision the future of the industry and our role in that future. For example, renewable energy production and battery storage facilities are developing in the Permian Basin to provide energy for electric drilling operations.  The oil and gas industry is contributing to the demand for renewable energy. These sort of developments help diversify energy sources used by our urban power grid, and provide needed economic development and income in rural areas.  Counties, school districts and property owners often prefer the steady predictable income from wind and solar production than the ups and downs of oil and gas.  Infrastructure investments such as solar farms and renewable battery storage are also spreading into our small counties with no oil and gas production.  Mason County is a prime example. The advances in technology taking place today are staggering    improved solar panels, increased battery storage capacity for solar and wind energy, experiments in alternative bio fuels and chemical sources of energy, technologies to capture and use previously flared natural gas locally or on site.  We cannot avoid the future.  It is already here.  Joe Biden is the only candidate who has proposed any energy plan for the future.  We should look at it and talk about it seriously, not dismissively. It is Texas spirit of innovation and exploration that made us a world leader in energy production. We can do it again. It is time we accept this new challenge  for today and tomorrow.

17,Oil and Gas Firms Are Saddling States with Billions in Cleanup Costs  Mother Jones,motherjones,"Mar 13, 2021",2021-03-13 11:00:59,"It's like a game of hot potato. Climate Desk collaboration. When an oil or gas well reaches the end of its lifespan, it must be plugged. If it isnt, the well might leak toxic chemicals into groundwater and spew methane, carbon dioxide, and other pollutants into the atmosphere for years on end. But plugging a well is no simple task: Cement must be pumped down into it to block the opening, and the tubes connecting it to tanks or pipelines must be removed, along with all the other onsite equipment. Then the top of the well has to be chopped off near the surface and plugged again, and the area around the rig must be cleaned up. There are nearly 60,000 unplugged wells in Colorado in need of this treatmenteach costing $140,000 on average, according to the Carbon Tracker, a climate think tank, in a new report that analyzes oil and gas permitting data. Plugging this many wells will cost a lot more than $8 billion, the report found. The system has put the state at risk, and it needs to change. Companies that drill wells in Colorado are legally required to pay for plugging them. They do so in the form of bonds, which the state can call on to pay for the plugging. But as it stands today, Colorado has only about $185 million from industryjust 2 percent of the estimated cleanup bill, according to the new study. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) assumes an average cost of $82,500 per welllower than the Carbon Trackers figure, which factors in issues like well depth. But even using the states more conservative number, the overall cleanup would cost nearly $5 billion, of which the money currently available from energy companies would cover less than 5 percent. This situation is the product of more than 150 years of energy extraction. Now, with the oil and gas industry looking less robust every year and reeling in the wake of the pandemic, the state of Colorado and its people could be on the hook for billions in cleanup costs. Meanwhile, unplugged wells persist as environmental hazards. This spring, Colorado will try to tackle the problem; state energy regulators have been tasked with reforming the policies governing well cleanup and financial commitments from industry. The system has put the state at risk, and it needs to change, said Josh Joswick, an organizer with the environmental group Earthworks. Now we have a government that wants to do something about it. Some states are worse off than Colorado. Data was not collected for Texas cleanup funds. Carbon Tracker Initiative The first western oil well broke ground in Colorado in 1860. Drilling has been an important part of the states economy ever since; as of 2019, Colorado ranked in the sixth and seventh in the nation for oil and natural gas production, respectively. When it comes to cleanup, Colorado uses a tiered system known as blanket bonding. Small operators can pay ahead with bonds on single wells. Drillers with more than 100 wells statewide pay a fixed reclamation fee of $100,000, regardless of the number of wells. A similar system also applies to wells on federal public land in the state. Large companies pay a single $150,000 bond, which covers unlimited federal public land wells throughout the country. There are about 7,400 public-land wells capable of producing oil or gas in Colorado, according to the Bureau of Land Management. Nearly half of the states unplugged wells are stripper wellslow-producing operations with small profit margins. When a driller walks away or cannot pay for cleanup, the well enters the states Orphan Well Program, which works to identify and plug these wells. There are about 200 wells in the program right now, according to the state. But a closer look at state data reveals a large number of wells at risk. Nearly half of the states unplugged wells are stripper wellslow-producing operations with small profit margins often at the end of their lifespans. These wells are particularly vulnerable to shifts in oil prices. That means they change hands often. This is a common tactic in the oil and gas industry: Spinning off liabilities to progressively weaker companies, until the final owner goes bankrupt and none of the previous owners are on the hook for cleanup, said Clark Williams-Derry, a finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. There are also inactive wells: Nearly 10 percent of the states wells have not produced oil or gas in at least two years, according to a Carbon Tracker analysis of state permitting data. Unlike some of the neighboring oil states, Colorado requires that companies pay a single bond on each inactive well of this sort. This costs either $10,000 or $20,000, depending on the depth of the well. In theory, these payments protect the state, in case the well owner goes bankrupt. But in Colorado, its still far cheaper for energy companies to pay the cost of that single, unused welland the small annual premium payments on the bondthan to actually plug it. Colorado clearly makes it cheaper to idle a well than to clean it up, Williams-Derry said. In Colorado, just two companies are responsible for nearly 70 percent of the bonds for currently inactive wells. One is Noble Energy Inc., which was purchased by the global oil giant Chevron in October 2020. The other is Kerr-McGee, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. Kerr-McGee was responsible for the 2017 home explosion in Firestone, Colorado, that killed two people. Last year, the COGCC fined the company more than $18 million for the accident, by far the largest fine in state history. Both companies still own large numbers of wells in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, the prolific oil and gas formation beneath central and eastern Colorado. And the mass desertion of wells is not hypothetical: In fall of 2019, a small company called Petroshare Corporation went bankrupt and left about 90 wells for the state to cleanup. That alone will cost Colorado millions of dollars. Last summer, when Californias largest oil driller filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, it left billions in debt and more than 17,000 unplugged wells. The oil and gas industry is already mired in a years-long decline that raises doubts about its ability to meet cleanup costs. In six out of the past seven years, energy has been either the worst- or second-worst-performing sector on the S&P 500. And the economic fallout from COVID-19 has only accelerated the decline. Oil prices hit record lows in 2020. The industrys debt approached record levels, and thousands of oilfield workers lost their jobs, . Many companies went bankrupt, including 12 drilling companies and six oilfield service companies in Colorado, according to Haynes and Boone LLP, a law firm that tracks industry trends. In 2019, a new law completely overhauled the states relationship to oil and gas. This spring, Colorado oil and gas regulators are tasked with reforming the financial requirements for well plugging. Its a big deal, especially in an oil state like Colorado: The law gives local governments more con",https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/03/oil-and-gas-firms-saddling-colorado-and-others-with-billions-in-cleanup-costs/

View Comments The Bureau of Land Management is preparing to lease more federal public land to the oil and gas industry in southeast New Mexico, seeking public input for an auction next spring. The BLMs April 14, 2021 lease sale was scheduled to offer six parcels on about 536 acres  four in Lea County and one and Chaves County, along with another in Dewey County, Oklahoma. The public scoping period was planned for Oct. 5 to Oct. 19, per a BLM news release. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. Details on the offered parcels were forthcoming, and anyone interested in providing input on potential impacts of the sale on the environment or potential alternatives can comment online at the BLMs website. The BLM will consider all substantive comments received during the public scoping period to ensure that the potential environmental consequences are analyzed in a manner that allows the BLM to make an informed decision about the proposed competitive lease sale, the release read. The proposed parcels were identified as available for possible oil and gas leasing under current BLM land-use plans. More: Oil and gas leaders discuss industry's struggles amid COVID-19 at Energy Summit But some activist groups have already raised opposition to the federal governments continued leasing of federal land amid the COVID-19 pandemic and health crisis. The Coalition to Protect National Parks in a Sept. 28 letter to U.S. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt called for a halt on any new lease sales during the pandemic. The group, made up of directors, superintendents, rangers and other staff at the National Park Service, argued the oil and gas industry was experiencing historic declines and the sale of public land during the bust could result in lower payments from the industry while encouraging more oil and gas development during a time when environmental oversight could be strained. More: Oil and gas industry, New Mexico works to curb greenhouse gas emissions, fight climate change Over the last few months, the oil and gas market has sunk to historic lows. At the same time, our national parks and public lands have taken on an even greater importance in the lives of people across the country during the global pandemic, said Phil Francis, chair of the Coalition. It just makes no sense for any leasing to move forward on public lands right now, and especially on the doorstep of our national parks. They also wrote that limits on public gatherings to slow the spread of the virus could impede public participation in the parcel nomination and leasing process. More: New Mexico oil and gas permits challenged as Permian Basin ozone levels rise Continuing to lease public lands in this environment not only prevents taxpayers from getting fair market value, but it also hinders efforts to manage those lands for other values that benefit the American people and local communities, including outdoor recreation, wildlife conservation, and cultural resources preservation, the letter read. Leasing land to oil and gas development near Carlsbad Caverns National Park was especially concerning, the letter read, by risking sensitive habitats, water supplies and night sky views at the parks. Connected to the Caverns intricate cave system are numerous karstic aquifers that supply drinking water to the Carlsbad area and other parts of southeast New Mexico. More: Investments grow in the Permian Basin as oil and gas market shows signs of recovery Drilling in the region, the Coalition warned, could pose a threat to such a critical resource. Caves have a fragile ecosystem, the letter read. Oil and gas drilling on nearby lands could leak gas or fluids into the caves passages, destroying the delicate balance that exists within the walls of the cave. Oil and gas industry leaders argued such a ban on federal oil and gas leasing could be damaging to New Mexicos economy which relies heavily on oil and gas development which, in New Mexico, mostly occurs on federally-owned land. More: Permian Basin crude oil pipeline cancelled as market struggles to recover from COVID-19 In a study earlier this month, conducted by the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA) and the American Petroleum Institute, the trade groups that represent thousands of oil and gas companies and operators reported New Mexico would lose 62,000 jobs by 2022 if oil and gas leasing on federal land was banned. Such a ban could also cost New Mexico more than $1 billion of federal revenue, the report read, and risk $2.5 million in funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund which is paid into by the oil and gas industry. Restricting oil and gas development on federal lands will rob New Mexico of opportunities for economic growth and hollow our schools of critical resources that put teachers in classrooms and help our young children learn, said NMOGA Executive Director Ryan Flynn. New Mexico has enjoyed economic success in recent years because of investments and responsible development on federally managed lands but changing course now will only ensure that jobs and capital stops at our state border.

19,"Oil and gas industry, New Mexico works to curb greenhouse gas emissions",currentargus,"Mar 13, 2021",2021-03-13 09:35:00,"Danie Droog, vice president of energy transition at Chevron said the use of data was essential in devising strategies to reducing emissions. View Comments A Colorado-based non-profit environmental organization teamed up with multiple leaders in the Permian Basin oil and gas industry to better track emissions from fossil fuel facilities to curb pollution and its impact on climate change. The Rocky Mountain Institute partnered with Spherical Analytics to create the Climate Action Engine (CAE), a digital platform that will offer emissions data in the Permian intended to inform the planning process as oil and gas companies seek to reduce their environmental impacts. Production, transportation or use of oil and gas products account for about half of global energy-related emissions, read a news release from the Institute, and about 84 million tons per year of methane emissions can be directly attributed to fossil fuel production. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. Thats why tracking such emissions became more important in recent years, the release read, and the CAE was intended to help companies meet reduction targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and invest more in efforts to curb the effects of climate change. It would use data from satellites, aircraft, monitoring station and industry reports to track emissions in the region, and would be gradually developed to operate across industry sectors, the release read. By bringing data, intelligence and people together onto one, single platform (Rocky Mountain Institute) is enabling climate solutions for the oil and gas industry that work for the benefit of the climate, companies, countries, and people, said Taku Ide, principal at the Institute. More: Former oil and gas well pad becomes campground south of Carlsbad With extensive connections into a comprehensive and growing ecosystem of climate-relevant data and partners, our hope is that the CAE will grow to be the go-to for high-value insights across all human-made GHG emissions sources, across all geographies. Operators participating in the CAEs pilot program included Shell Energy, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Origin Energy who will use the system and provide feedback while identifying ways to reduce emissions. Danie Droog, vice president of energy transition at Chevron said the use of data was essential in devising strategies to reducing emissions and the industrys impact on pollution. More: Oil and gas leaders discuss industry's struggles amid COVID-19 at Energy Summit Droog said the company already cut its emissions in its U.S. operations using data-driven initiatives, and the CAE could help further the companys emission priorities using real-time data as the industry continues to operate. By using data to inform priorities and decisions, Chevron has reduced methane emissions in our US onshore production operations by 85 percent since 2013, he said. As we continue our journey to actively address emissions, we are excited about the opportunity to partner with CAE to understand the potential for real-time emissions intelligence. Bart Cahir, senior vice president of unconventionals at ExxonMobil said climate change driven by oil and gas emissions must be curbed to protect the environment from climate change, and the information on the CAE could help industry and regulators alike in efforts to do so. More: Investments grow in the Permian Basin as oil and gas market shows signs of recovery Climate change risks posed by methane and other greenhouse gas emissions are serious and warrant action, said Bart Cahir, senior vice president of unconventionals at ExxonMobil. The Climate Action Engine developed by RMI uses advanced science to provide enhanced, more comprehensive information to industry, regulators, and investors to help deliver actionable results to reduce methane emissions. Shell Vice President of U.S. Shales Frits Klap said the company was able to reduce flaring in the Permian by about 80 percent since 2017, crediting the reduction to using new technologies such as the CAE. He said the company hoped to reduce its carbon emissions to zero by 2050. More: Permian Basin crude oil pipeline cancelled as market struggles to recover from COVID-19 Combining data and (artificial intelligence) on a single platform is an innovation that could enhance our methane emissions management and supports Shells ambition to become a net zero emissions energy business by 2050 or sooner, Klap said. We look forward to the potential additional benefits from participating in this CAE pilot. Shell recently expanded its use of drones in the Permian Basin to increase its methane leak detection and repair program in the region, partnering with Baker Hughes through its technological initiative Avitas, embarking on a two-year program to inspect more than 500 sites from the air. The issue of methane and other emissions from oil and gas recently became controversial in New Mexico after Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham established the Climate Change Task Force and called on her administration to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout New Mexico. More: New Mexico oil and gas permits challenged as Permian Basin ozone levels rise The New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) and Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) began devising stricter methane regulations for oil and gas operations while industry leaders worried the new requirements could be overly burdensome and send more business to Texas. Environmentalists maligned the recently released draft rules as not going far enough as they included exceptions for low-performing or stripper wells that opponents argued account for up to 95 percent of active wells in New Mexico. Meanwhile, state officials criticized the administration of President Donald Trump for rolling back federal regulations in August at the Environmental Protection Agency. New Mexico is well on the way to putting in place our own robust and innovative regulations to curb methane emissions in the oil and gas industry, which will yield improved air quality and fewer climate change-inducing emissions, Lujan Grisham said.

Brent crude futures for May slipped 11 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $69.52 a barrel by 0403 GMT while U.S. West TexasIntermediate crude for April was at $65.83 a barrel, down 19 cents, or 0.3 per cent. Front-month Brent is on track to post weekly gains for the eighth week after touching a 13-month high on Monday following attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. Sentiment was also buoyed by the decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, earlier this month to largely hold production cuts in April. Investors have been pumping funds into commodities such as oil on expectations of a demand recovery in the second half of the year as the global economy grows, while a wider rollout of vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic allows more people to travel this summer. ""Assuming vaccination programmes are successful, we expect pent-up demand for gasoline to be released this summer during the U.S. and European driving season,"" FGE analysts said in a note. RBC Capital analysts said the fundamentals for summer gasoline is the most bullish in nearly a decade. ""We think this will support the entire oil complex this summer and beyond."" OPEC said on Thursday a recovery in oil demand will be focused on the second half of the year. The United States, world's largest oil consumer, saw a massive draw on U.S. gasoline stocks last week as the winter storm in Texas disrupted refining output Oil prices sustained at higher levels are expected to draw U.S. producers to increase output, JP Morgananalysts said in their weekly note.

ExxonMobil is scheduled to start drilling in one of 13 blocks inside Cyprus exclusive economic zone by years end. Turkey doesnt recognize Cyprus as a state and opposes its gas search, which it says infringes on its rights to oil and gas reserves and ignores the rights of breakaway Turkish Cypriots to the ethnically split islands natural resources. Turkey also says that its continental shelf overlaps part of Cyprus exclusive economic zone. Cyprus was divided in 1974 when Turkey invaded in response to a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a declaration of independence by Turkish Cypriots in the islands north, where it maintains more than 35,000 troops.

Article content We would protect until the end our and the Republic of Northern Cyprus rightsagainst those attempting to take unilateral, illegitimate steps that are unfair to Turkey, said Turkeys Energy and Natural Resources Minister Fatih Donmez during a tour of the Conquerer on Tuesday. In February, Turkish warships prevented a drillship from carrying out exploratory drilling southeast of Cyprus, where Italian company Eni is licensed to search for gas. Days earlier, Eni had announced a significant find southwest of Cyprus. Tiny Cyprus, with a population of just over a million people, rejects Turkeys claims. It says its gas search is fully in line with international law and says Turkey is trying to create a crisis to undermine Cyprus energy program. Cypriot government spokesman Prodromos Prodromou said any potential wealth from newly discovered gas deposits belongs to all Cypriots  both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot  and will be shared once a peace accord reunifying the island is reached. Whatever is found in the exclusive economic zone of the Cypriot state is the property of the Cypriot people, meaning all legal citizens of Cyprus, which includes Turkish Cypriots but not necessarily Turkey, said Prodromou. Frances Total is also licensed to drill off Cyprus southern coast. In 2011, Texas-based Noble Energy discovered a field estimated to hold 4.5 trillion cubic feet (130 billion cubic meters) of gas.

Bernhardt attributed the revenue boost to Trump-era policy changes that aim to open up more federal land to drilling and other energy development. Democrats contend Bernhardt  who is a Washington veteran with lobbying ties to U.S. energy companies  is vulnerable to conflicts of interest as head of the department. Environmental groups have accused him of making regulatory decisions on the countrys natural resources to benefit industries. This was a historic year for oil and gas, and clearly illustrates what is possible when public lands are put to work using innovation, best science, and best practices, said Brian Steed, BLM Deputy Director for Policy and Programs. Our sound energy policy continues to ensure reliable, safe, abundant, and affordable energy for all Americans, without putting unnecessary burdens on industry. The Hobbs News-Sun reported that Bernhardt briefly toured a plant owned by rig manufacturer Watson Hopper and told employees there that Trump had asked him to visit the region a day after his State of the Union Address in Washington.

23,Energy companies have left Colorado with billions of dollars in oil and gas cleanup,sentinelcolorado,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 18:29:24,"As the state tries to reform its relationship to drilling, an expensive task awaits. High Country News W hen an oil or gas well reaches the end of its lifespan, it must be plugged. If it isnt, the well might leak toxic chemicals into groundwater and spew methane, carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere for years on end. But plugging a well is no simple task: Cement must be pumped down into it to block the opening, and the tubes connecting it to tanks or pipelines must be removed, along with all the other onsite equipment. Then the top of the well has to be chopped off near the surface and plugged again, and the area around the rig must be cleaned up. There are nearly 60,000 unplugged wells in Colorado in need of this treatment  each costing $140,000 on average, according to the Carbon Tracker, a climate think tank, in a new report that analyzes oil and gas permitting data. Plugging this many wells will cost a lot more than $8 billion, the report found. Companies that drill wells in Colorado are legally required to pay for plugging them. They do so in the form of bonds, which the state can call on to pay for the plugging. But as it stands today, Colorado has only about $185 million from industry  just 2% of the estimated cleanup bill, according to the new study. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) assumes a cost of $82,500 per each well  lower than the Carbon Trackers figure, which factors in issues like well depth. But even using the states more conservative number, the overall cleanup would cost nearly $5 billion, of which the money currently available from energy companies would cover less than 5%. This is the product of more than 150 years of energy extraction. Now, with the oil and gas industry looking less robust every year and reeling in the wake of the pandemic, the state of Colorado and its people could be on the hook for billions in cleanup costs. Meanwhile, unplugged wells persist as environmental hazards. This spring, Colorado will tackle the problem; state energy regulators have been tasked with reforming the policies governing well cleanup and financial commitments from industry. The system has put the state at risk, and it needs to change, said Josh Joswick, an organizer with the environmental group Earthworks. Now we have a government that wants to do something about it. T he first Western oil well broke ground in Colorado in 1860. Drilling has been an important part of the states economy ever since; as of 2019, Colorado ranked in the sixth and seventh in the nation for oil and natural gas production, respectively. When it comes to cleanup, Colorado uses a tiered system known as blanket bonding. Small operators can pay ahead on single wells. Drillers with more than 100 wells statewide pay a fixed reclamation fee of $100,000, regardless of the number of wells. A similar system also applies to wells on federal public land in the state. Large companies pay a single $150,000 bond, which covers unlimited federal public land wells throughout the country. There are about 7,400 public-land wells capable of producing oil or gas in Colorado, according to the Bureau of Land Management. When a driller walks away or cannot pay for cleanup, the well enters the states Orphan Well Program, which works to identify and plug these wells. There are about 200 wells in the program right now, according to the state. But a closer look at state data reveals a large number of wells at risk. Nearly half of the states unplugged wells are stripper wells low-producing operations with small profit margins often at the end of their lifespans. These wells are particularly vulnerable to shifts in oil prices. That means they change hands often. This is a common tactic in the oil and gas industry: Spinning off liabilities to progressively weaker companies, until the final owner goes bankrupt and none of the previous owners are on the hook for cleanup, said Clark Williams-Derry, a finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. There are also inactive wells: Nearly 10% of the states wells have not produced oil or gas in at least two years, according to a Carbon Tracker analysis of state permitting data. Unlike some of the neighboring oil states, Colorado requires that companies pay a single bond on each inactive well of this sort. This costs either $10,000 or $20,000, depending on the depth of the well. In theory, these payments protect the state, in case the well owner goes bankrupt. But in Colorado, its still far cheaper for energy companies to pay the cost of that single, unused well  and the small annual premium payments on the bond  than to actually plug it. Colorado clearly makes it cheaper to idle a well than to clean it up, Williams-Derry said. In Colorado, just two companies are responsible for nearly 70% of the bonds for currently inactive wells. One is Noble Energy Inc., which was purchased by the global oil giant Chevron in October 2020. The other is Kerr-McGee, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. Kerr-McGee was responsible for the 2017 home explosion in Firestone, Colorado, that killed two people. Last year, the COGCC fined the company more than $18 million for the accident, by far the largest fine in state history. Both companies still own large numbers of wells in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, the prolific oil and gas formation beneath central and eastern Colorado. And the mass desertion of wells is not hypothetical: In fall of 2019, a small company called Petroshare Corporation went bankrupt and left about 90 wells for the state to cleanup. That alone will cost Colorado millions of dollars. Last summer, when Californias largest oil driller filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, it left billions in debt and more than17,000 unplugged wells. The oil and gas industry is already mired in a years-long decline that raises doubts about its ability to meet cleanup costs. In six out of the past seven years, energy has been either the worst- or second-worst-performing sector on the S&P 500. And the economic fallout from COVID-19 has only accelerated the decline. Oil prices hit record lows in 2020. The industrys debt approached record levels, and thousands of oilfield workers lost their jobs, Colorado Public Radio reported Many companies went bankrupt, including 12 drilling companies and six oilfield service companies in Colorado, according to Haynes and Boone LLP, a law firm that tracks industry trends. I n 2019, a new law completely overhauled the states relationship to oil and gas. This spring, Colorado oil and gas regulators are tasked with reforming the financial requirements for well plugging. Its a big deal, especially in an oil state like Colorado: The law gives local governments more control over oil and gas development, and it rewrote the mission of the COGCC, the states energy regulator. The COGCC has subsequently banned the burning off or releasing of natural gas, a routine drilling practice, and instituted a broad range of wildlife and public health protection policies.

24,Can Carbon Capture Make Clean Oil Production A Reality?,oilprice,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 16:00:00,"Governments, oil majors, and eccentric billionaires are all attempting to create affordable and effective carbon capture technology as the world aims to reduce emissions As governments and regulators push for a lower carbon future, the race is on to develop carbon capture technology. Even Elon Musk has joined the race, launching a $100 million carbon capture competition.  Exxon Mobil has stated this week that there could be a $2 trillion market for carbon capture by 2040. This comes as the company announces a $3 billion investment in carbon capture as well as carbon storage projects over the next five years.  Recent investments in new carbon capture technologies by European majors, including BP and Shell, have gained praise from the media and environmental organizations who believe it is a step towards greater sustainability for the oil and gas sector.  Oil companies acknowledge that they will be pumping oil and gas for decades to come. However, they are looking for ways to reduce carbon emissions to ensure that production is less harmful to the environment, while also investing in renewable energy research and development.  Many of these aims go hand-in-hand with the goals of the Paris Agreement, which was signed by 194 states around the globe by November 2020. As governments attempt to bring their national policies in line with the agreement, the oil and gas industry must follow suit.  Carbon capture is positive news for everyone, as President Biden seeks to encourage greater efforts to manage climate change without hurting oil-dependent states. To this end, Congress recently approved legislation on the continued research and development of carbon capture through 2025 by the Department of Energy.  Related Video Fukushima's Radioactive Wastewater Disaster  Biden is not the only one encouraging carbon capture, use, and storage CCUS. This year, the UN announced the goal of net-zero emissions, calling on governments and companies to invest in capturing CO2 emissions from coal and gas power plants, and from heavy industry, for deep underground storage or re-use.  The UN has just produced a report on CCUS, outlining the current practices around the world as well as state-specific CCUS projects. The report aims to encourage other member states to invest in CCUS in order to reduce carbon emissions over the next decade.  However, investment in CCUS should not be taken lightly, with Europe needing an anticipated 320 billion to achieve successful CCUS deployment by 2050, as well as a further 50 billion for transport infrastructure.  At present, CCUS technologies do not have the capacity needed to remove enough CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality. This means that companies must look at other ways to become more carbon-friendly, as well as investing heavily in the improvement of CCUS mechanisms.  Related Iran Pushes Development Of Major Oil Region Under 25-Year China Deal  The UAE announced this week that it is seeking new partnerships in CCUS and emissions-cutting as oil prices soar after a difficult year. Brent hit $70 as the OPEC states refused to bring more oil production online.  Sultan Al Jaber, the Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company ADNOC stated, There is no credible way of reaching global climate goals without seriously advancing and ensuring the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage.  So far, ADNOC has partnered with Total to advance its CCUS technologies, as part of its aim to reduce its carbon intensity by 25 percent over the next decade. Its aim is to capture 800,000 tons of CO2 via its Al Reyadah facility, as oil production steadily increases. The UAE expects to capture 5 million tons annually by 2030.  Both oil majors and states around the world are in the race to produce the more effective carbon capture technologies to bring oil and gas production in line with net-zero aims over the next decade. Greater investment and collaboration between governments and industry could prove effective in making sustainable oil production a real possibility.

25,Investors call on oil and gas to address climate concerns in Permian,currentargus,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 11:49:00,"A trend emerged in the energy investment community of considering companies' commitments to environmental issues. View Comments Energy investors throughout the Permian Basin and the world are considering aspects beyond financial success and production levels, opting to also look at how companies react to environmental and social issues when choosing where to put their money. Initiatives in environmental, social and governance, known as ESG in the industry, came into prominence in recent years and were pushed into the foreground of the fossil fuel investment community with recent efforts by the new administration of President Joe Biden to address climate change along with a societal trend toward such issues. Nick Volkmer, vice president of ESG and renewables for energy industry analytics firm Enverus, formerly Drillinginfo, said the push for ESG initiatives is mostly driven by investor concerns that companies are addressing environmental and social issues along with producing oil and natural gas. More: New Mexico bill to diversify economy beyond oil and gas gains steam in State House He said a recent report showed 3,000 investment firms across the world representing up to $100 trillion in assets recently signed on to the Principles for Responsible Investment  a network supported by the United Nations seeking to increase responsibility in investment. This signaled, Volkmer said, that ESG considerations by investors must be shared by the companies that rely on them. We talk to investors every day and we talk to operators too. A lot of what were seeing in the ESG world is investor driven, Volkmer said. Its looking not just at a companys finances and economics but also adding another pillar to the investment as investors make sure their portfolios are optimized. More: Lujan Grisham joins state leaders voicing concerns for Biden's halt on oil and gas leases What this means on the ground in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and West Texas  one of the U.S. and the worlds most prolific oil plays  is operators like Diamondback Energy are looking to spend more on efforts to curb their carbon footprint and respond to government policies aimed at reducing pollution and climate change. During its 2020 Fourth Quarter Disclosure to investors, Diamondbackreported it installed air-driven pneumatic valves which are used to pressurize storage tanks. The valves are traditionally powered by natural gas, leading to emissions. The new valves will reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses at Diamondbacks facilities, and the company planned to spend up to $70 million to retrofit all of its tank batteries with similar, modernized devices. More: Permian Basin oil and gas companies continue to merge, as market recovers from COVID-19 Diamondback also reported it cut its flaring  the process of burning off excess gas from the wellhead  from 5.7 percent of produced gas in 2019 to 0.5 percent last year, a reduction of 87 percent. The company also sought to electrify its drilling and completion equipment to reduce the use and emission of natural gas while also conducting quarterly leak detection using flyover and infrared cameras, and minimizing the use of storage tanks on the surface. Overall, the company committed to reducing its greenhouse gas intensity from 2019 levels by at least 50 percent by 2024 and its methane intensity by 70 percent during the same time frame. More: Ozone problems continue to plague New Mexico. Enviros seek federal action, blame oil and gas Its companies agreeing that we need to take this into consideration, Volkmer said. Thats why its grown so much over the last few years. Investors are looking at this as a way to understand the resiliency of their investments. Before ESG came into prominence, Volkmer said investment was primarily based on a companys production levels and financial performance. What could 'peak oil' mean for climate change? Recently, market analysts suggested the world could be at peak demand for oil, meaning demand for fossil fuels might not continue to grow in the future, he said investors are finding more ways to distinguish between investments in a potentially shrinking market. More: Extreme winter weather in Permian Basin could cause spike in oil and gas emissions Theres a question on the long-term demand of hydrocarbons. Youre looking at how all these oil companies position themselves in the future, Volkmer said. Were going to need oil in foreseeable future but maybe not everybodys oil. I think everyone is in agreement that if you could get oil from a company with zero emissions or a company that has emissions and its the same price, youd want the company with zero emissions. For the Permian Basin, Volkmer said ESG is of higher concern than possibly anywhere else in the world as it's one of the most active regions for energy development. More: Permian Basin sees more oil investments, New Mexico rig count remains stagnant When you look at the Permian, its the epicenter of US oil and gas development. I think it gets a higher amount of scrutiny, he said. When you have so much investment going into one place and have so much production coming from it, there is a lot more scrutiny on various aspects, one of those is environmental performance. On the governance side, New Mexico state regulators under the administration of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham who took office in 2019, quickly began seeking ways to enact stricter regulations intended to curb the climate impact of the oil and gas industry. This also presented an issue for investors, Volkmer said, as they considered how much a company would have to spend to comply with tougher, upcoming requirements. More: Oil and gas prices climb on production cuts, supply declines. COVID-19 recovery continues A companys environmental performance has never been so visible. Now that its visible you can start seeing it impact decision making, he said. Investors have been asking for this. Further fueling the push for ESG investments, environmental and shareholder groups alike recently began calling on major energy companies to embrace a future of less carbon pollution. Major Permian and global producer Chevron recently shared its c limate change goals with investors in a March 9 presentation . Chevron reported spending more than $1 billion on carbon sequestration, while announcing it had reduced methane emissions from onshore operations by 85 percent since 2013 and planned to eliminate flaring by 2030.

View Comments President Joe Bidens administration announced it was moving forward with a national review of the U.S. federal oil and gas leasing program amid a temporary halt on new leases of federal land for fossil fuel development. The Department of the Interior announced it would hold a public meeting on March 25 including local stakeholders and environmental groups along with industry leaders to discuss the review and assist in creating a report to inform future decision making. New Mexico political leaders on both sides of the aisle expressed concern to the Biden administration of the unique impact two oil- and gas-related orders from the Biden camp could have on the state, with both the states administration and members of Congress calling for clarity on the specifics and echoing industry concerns. More: New Mexico regulators tangle over oil and gas pipeline authority via Senate bill Upon taking office, Acting Secretary of the Interior Scott de la Vega announced a suspension of bureau-level decision making within the DOI for activities like drilling permits and other approvals needed by oil and gas operators. Biden via executive order later placed an indefinite but expressly temporary pause on any new leases of federal land to the industry, vowing to conduct a review of the countrys federal oil and gas program. Both actions drew swift criticism from New Mexicos oil and gas industry and its supporters who feared the actions could disrupt operations as the industry recovers from an historic downturn in fossil fuel markets created by the COVID-19 pandemic. More: Lujan Grisham joins state leaders voicing concerns for Biden's halt on oil and gas leases Environmental groups in the state said the review was a chance to update an antiquated leasing program to address concerns for pollution and climate change along with fair returns to taxpayers for public lands. Despite industry claims, the Executive Order is a pause and will allow permits to be processed on existing valid leases, said Greg Peters, public lands and wildlife advocate at Conservation Voters New Mexico. The industry stockpiled leases during the (former-President Donald) Trump administration fire-sale on federal lands, resulting in nearly 14 million acres of unused and non-producing leases that remove that land from other uses, like outdoor recreation and wildlife protection. More: Ozone problems continue to plague New Mexico. Enviros seek federal action, blame oil and gas More than half of New Mexicos oil and gas operations  which the state relies on for about a third of its budget  occurs on federal land. Critics argued the restrictions on public land could cause oil and gas companies to move operations to neighboring Texas where about 90 percent of oil and gas land is private and would be unaffected by the orders. Companies could also shift to developing fossil fuels in foreign countries, opponents argued, with much less stringent environmental regulations. More: Energy secretary called on to consider impact on New Mexico, oil and gas of federal policy In recent letters to the Biden administration, New Mexico Democrat U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujan called on the Biden administration to provide federal relief to New Mexico as slowing oil and gas production could negatively impact the states economy. As the department considers longer term policies to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and limit climate change, we ask for your assistance in ensuring that states like New Mexico receive assistance in making the transition to a zero carbon economy, read a March 2 letter from the senators to de la Vega. Oil and as workers and communities they live in have helped build our nation for more than a century, and revenues from mineral production have supported New Mexicos educational system and state budget. More: Extreme winter weather in Permian Basin could cause spike in oil and gas emissions In another March 2 letter to Bidens National Climate Adviser Regina McCarthy, the senators wrote they intended to work closely with the administration to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels for states like New Mexico while ensuring local economies are not damaged amid the transition. We will be putting forward concrete solutions to help wean states like New Mexico off fossil fuels, including state revenue replacement and targeted, place-specific programs for career re-training, economic diversification and transition, read the letter. New Mexicos lone Republican U.S. Rep. Yvette Herrell joined a bipartisan group of congresspeople in penning a March 5 letter to de la Vega calling on the DOI to return approval authority to sub-agencies like Bureau of Land Management and its local field offices in oil-producing regions. More: Bills transitioning New Mexico away from oil and gas advance in the Senate, House The congresspeople argued de la Vegas actions created delays in important regulatory activities like rights of way needed for wells to tap into pipelines  delays that could lead to more natural gas being released into the atmosphere rather than being transported to market. New Mexico Democrat Reps. Teresa Leger Fernandez and Deb Haaland  Bidens nominee for Interior Secretary  did not sign onto the letter. We ask that you restore the decision-making authority to issue permits for rights of way to local agency experts, the letter read. An important process such as this cannot be bogged down by unnecessary bureaucracy, as the livelihoods of many of our constituents may well depend on a permit being approved in a timely manner. More: Permian Basin sees more oil investments, New Mexico rig count remains stagnant The DOI reported fossil fuel development accounted for about a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the industry stockpiled millions of acres of public lands and waters under the administration of former-President Donald Trump who pledged an American energy dominance agenda, seeking to open up more public lands to fossil fuels and increasing leasing during his four-year term. Of the 26 million acres of federal land leased to the industry, 13.9 million or 53 percent were unused, records show, while 77 percent of the 12 million acres of federal waters leased were also unused.

There are nearly 60,000 unplugged wells in Colorado in need of this treatment  each costing $140,000 on average, according to the Carbon Tracker, a climate think tank, in a new report that analyzes oil and gas permitting data. Plugging this many wells will cost a lot  more than $8 billion, the report found. Companies that drill wells in Colorado are legally required to pay for plugging them. They do so in the form of bonds, which the state can call on to pay for the plugging. But as it stands today, Colorado has only about $185 million from industry  just 2% of the estimated cleanup bill, according to the new study. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) assumes an average cost of $82,500 per well  lower than the Carbon Trackers figure, which factors in issues like well depth. But even using the states more conservative number, the overall cleanup would cost nearly $5 billion, of which the money currently available from energy companies would cover less than 5%. This situation is the product of more than 150 years of energy extraction. Now, with the oil and gas industry looking less robust every year and reeling in the wake of the pandemic, the state of Colorado and its people could be on the hook for billions in cleanup costs. Meanwhile, unplugged wells persist as environmental hazards. This spring, Colorado will try to tackle the problem; state energy regulators have been tasked with reforming the policies governing well cleanup and financial commitments from industry. The system has put the state at risk, and it needs to change, said Josh Joswick, an organizer with the environmental group Earthworks. Now we have a government that wants to do something about it. The first western oil well broke ground in Colorado in 1860. Drilling has been an important part of the states economy ever since; as of 2019, Colorado ranked in the sixth and seventh in the nation for oil and natural gas production, respectively. When it comes to cleanup, Colorado uses a tiered system known as blanket bonding. Small operators can pay ahead with bonds on single wells. Drillers with more than 100 wells statewide pay a fixed reclamation fee of $100,000, regardless of the number of wells. A similar system also applies to wells on federal public land in the state. Large companies pay a single $150,000 bond, which covers unlimited federal public land wells throughout the country. There are about 7,400 public-land wells capable of producing oil or gas in Colorado, according to the Bureau of Land Management. When a driller walks away or cannot pay for cleanup, the well enters the states Orphan Well Program, which works to identify and plug these wells. There are about 200 wells in the program right now, according to the state. But a closer look at state data reveals a large number of wells at risk. Nearly half of the states unplugged wells are stripper wells  low-producing operations with small profit margins often at the end of their lifespans. These wells are particularly vulnerable to shifts in oil prices. That means they change hands often. This is a common tactic in the oil and gas industry: Spinning off liabilities to progressively weaker companies, until the final owner goes bankrupt and none of the previous owners are on the hook for cleanup, said Clark Williams-Derry, a finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. There are also inactive wells: Nearly 10% of the states wells have not produced oil or gas in at least two years, according to a Carbon Tracker analysis of state permitting data. Unlike some of the neighboring oil states, Colorado requires that companies pay a single bond on each inactive well of this sort. This costs either $10,000 or $20,000, depending on the depth of the well. In theory, these payments protect the state, in case the well owner goes bankrupt. But in Colorado, its still far cheaper for energy companies to pay the cost of that single, unused well  and the small annual premium payments on the bond  than to actually plug it. Colorado clearly makes it cheaper to idle a well than to clean it up, Williams-Derry said. In Colorado, just two companies are responsible for nearly 70% of the bonds for currently inactive wells. One is Noble Energy Inc., which was purchased by the global oil giant Chevron in October 2020. The other is Kerr-McGee, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. Kerr-McGee was responsible for the 2017 home explosion in Firestone, Colorado, that killed two people. Last year, the COGCC fined the company more than $18 million for the accident, by far the largest fine in state history. Both companies still own large numbers of wells in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, the prolific oil and gas formation beneath central and eastern Colorado. And the mass desertion of wells is not hypothetical: In fall of 2019, a small company called Petroshare Corporation went bankrupt and left about 90 wells for the state to cleanup. That alone will cost Colorado millions of dollars. Last summer, when Californias largest oil driller filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, it left billions in debt and more than 17,000 unplugged wells. The oil and gas industry is already mired in a years-long decline that raises doubts about its ability to meet cleanup costs. In six out of the past seven years, energy has been either the worst- or second-worst-performing sector on the S&P 500. And the economic fallout from COVID-19 has only accelerated the decline. Oil prices hit record lows in 2020. The industrys debt approached record levels, and thousands of oilfield workers lost their jobs, Colorado Public Radio reported . Many companies went bankrupt, including 12 drilling companies and six oilfield service companies in Colorado, according to Haynes and Boone LLP, a law firm that tracks industry trends. In 2019, a new law completely overhauled the states relationship to oil and gas. This spring, Colorado oil and gas regulators are tasked with reforming the financial requirements for well plugging. Its a big deal,",https://energynews.us/2021/03/12/energy-companies-have-left-colorado-with-billions-of-dollars-in-oil-and-gas-cleanup/
28,Top Oil and Gas Themes in 2021 |Rigzone,rigzone,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 10:23:20,"Data and analytics company GlobalData has identified several themes that are 'set to have the most influence' on the oil and gas sector this year. Tweet Data and analytics company GlobalData has identified several themes that are 'set to have the most influence' on the oil and gas sector this year. Data and analytics company GlobalData has identified several themes that are set to have the most influence on the oil and gas sector this year. According to the company, Covid-19 and sustainability will continue to heavily impact the oil and gas industry. Other key themes that will shape the sector in 2021 include topics such as renewable energy, hydrogen, electric vehicles, energy storage, liquefied natural gas, and gas flaring, as well as others, the company outlined. Tech themes such as robotics, industrial internet, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, and cybersecurity will be of paramount importance as the industry looks to become more efficient, Ravindra Puranik, an oil and gas analyst at GlobalData, said in a statement sent to Rigzone. Oil and gas companies are likely to take a varied approach concerning different tech themes, depending upon their immediate requirements. Cloud computing and cybersecurity themes will come to the fore with the post-pandemic new normal of remote working, Puranik added. The GlobalData analyst noted that the pandemic brought a major oil and gas demand shock, delayed projects, and raised additional questions about the potential for future oil demand growth. Against this backdrop, the perceived shift towards new energies will affect new crude oil developments, especially ones requiring longer turnaround time, Puranik said. Themes such as shale or integrated refineries, which were flourishing until 2019, came under extreme pressure in 2020 due to the pandemic, Puranik stated. Prominent shale drillers such as Chesapeake Energy and Whiting Petroleum went through bankruptcy proceedings, while ace refiners such as Shell and Marathon Petroleum announced the permanent closure of some of their refineries to mitigate the downturn, the GlobalData analyst added. Oil majors such as Total, Shell, BP and Equinor will be at the forefront in implementing sustainability initiatives at their workplaces. Besides setting net-zero emission targets, these companies have initiated concrete steps to invest in low-carbon projects, including renewables, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage to show their commitment towards the environment, Puranik continued. In addition to the oil and gas sector, GlobalData covers several other industries, including mining, power, automotive, technology, construction, and packaging. The business was formed back in 2016 following the consolidation of several data and analytics providers.

29,Study: Billions in government relief went to oil and gas amid COVID-19,currentargus,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 08:09:00,"In total, 56 oil and gas companies issued the bonds, the report read, while the Federal Reserve purchased the debt of 19 companies. View Comments As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the United States, Americans were ordered to stay home and restricted from travel to stem the spread of the virus. The mandate weakened fuel demands as more cars sat idle and fewer planes took off, and led to an historic drop in price of oil never seen before. By April, about a month after the pandemic was in full force in the U.S., the price of domestic crude plummeted below $0 per barrel  the first time in history it had fallen into negative territory. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. The drop led to shut in wells, deactivated drilling rigs, bankruptcies and layoffs from northern North Dakota near the Canadian border to southeast New Mexico mere hours from the U.S. border to Mexico. The federal government, to save the U.S. economy began offering financial relief to some of its major industries including oil and gas. Since such relief began in March, oil and gas companies issued almost $100 billion in new bonds backed by the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury Department, per a report conducted by Friends of the Earth, Public Citizen and BailoutWatch. More: BLM seeking input on April 2021 oil and gas lease sale despite opposition amid COVID-19 The groups are all non-profit watchdog organizations focused on environmental and financial issues. In total, 56 oil and gas companies issued the bonds, the report read, while the Federal Reserve purchased the debt of 19 companies for about $60 billion in new bonds issued and about 60 percent of energy debt issued since March. Some of New Mexico's biggest producers received billions in relief funding, records show, with Chevron issuing $12 billion in bonds and ExxonMobil issuing $9.5 billion. More: Oil and gas contributes thousands of dollars to New Mexico politics in 2020 General Election Occidental Petroleum issued another $5 billion in bonds, per the report. So far this year, oil and gas companies issued a total of $129 billion in bonds, the report read, the highest since 2010. Co-author of the study Lukas Ross, program director at Friends of the Earth said the oil and gas industry was exploiting the COVID-19 crisis to make money. More: Oil and gas leaders discuss industry's struggles amid COVID-19 at Energy Summit He said the industry was provided with financial assistance that should have been afforded to the average, working American. Big Oil is exploiting COVID-19 to go on an unprecedented borrowing binge, and the Trump administration is to blame, Ross said. Polluters are getting a $100 billion lifeline while most Americans are being left behind. Alan Zibel, research director at Public Citizen said the government assistance for the industry represented a bailout for fossil fuel companies and that the money should be used to assist small businesses, local governments and people struggling to make ends meet amid the public health crisis. More: Oil and gas industry, New Mexico works to curb greenhouse gas emissions, fight climate change When consumers take on too much credit card debt, they can be forced into bankruptcy and face financial ruin. But when the oil and gas industry accumulates too much debt, it gets a bailout on the backs of taxpayers, Zibel said. Instead of bailing out climate-destroying fossil fuel companies we must assist small businesses, local governments and individuals facing dire financial straits. Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance said relief for the industry was warranted to protect one of the nations top economic drivers and to protect national security by maintaining Americas energy independence. More: Devon Energy merges with WPX Energy in $12 billion deal focused on Permian Basin oil She made her arguments during a Tuesday hearing before the U.S. House Natural Resources Subcommittee regarding royalty relief granted to oil and gas companies by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Sgamma said the relief granted amid the pandemic was a small reduction that could prevent the industry from slipping further into financial ruin brought on by the health crisis and subsequent recession. The targeted, temporary relief granted by the Interior Secretary, using the power given him by Congress, enabled some producers to ensure the solvency of their leases over a few months so that they can generate royalties years into the future, Sgamma said. More: New Mexico oil and gas permits challenged as Permian Basin ozone levels rise She also argued that the federal government gave more than a trillion dollars in COVID-19 relief to companies in all sectors and it would be unfair to exclude the oil and gas industry amid the pandemic. When over a trillion dollars of COVID relief was directly given to companies across all sectors of the economy in response to the global pandemic, why would Congress begrudge one industry a relatively tiny amount of temporary tax reduction? Sgamma said. Rather, Congress should recognize the contribution of the oil and natural gas industry responding to and providing solutions for this health crisis, rather than singling it out for exclusion. More: Investments grow in the Permian Basin as oil and gas market shows signs of recovery To congresspeople who support bans on fracking and oil and gas leasing on federal land, including former-Vice President and Democrat Presidential Candidate Joe Biden, Sgamma said such an action would generate no revenue for the nation while providing financial support to the industry would allow it to remain an economic leader for decades. Those in Congress who support efforts to ban leasing and development of oil and natural gas on federal lands, which would ensure no future royalty revenue at all, are worried about temporary, emergency royalty relief, she said. That relief, like CARES Act direct assistance, was a response to the unprecedented COVID pandemic lockdowns and ensuing economic collapse, not a nefarious giveaway.

View Comments As the oil and gas industry struggles to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in managing wastewater and other liquid byproducts in the Permian Basin continued to lead to investments in the water midstream sector. The need to manage oil and gas wastewater, often known as produced water by the industry, grew as extraction boomed in the desert regions of southeast New Mexico and West Texas where water is scarce. Companies continued to invest in water management facilities despite what many viewed as a temporary downturn in the value of crude oil and natural gas. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. Breakwater Energy Partners announced on Monday the construction of a produced water recycling facility between Howard and Martin counties in Texas near its border to New Mexico. Produced water is a combination of flow back from hydraulic fracturing and formation water brought up with oil and gas from underground shale. Its high in salt and other chemicals and typically disposed of through infection wells that send the water back underground. More: Oil and gas waste facility coming to Permian Basin; New Mexico continues work on produced water In recent years, many companies began recycling and reusing the water for subsequent fracking operations, either at their own facilities or through a midstream operator. At Breakwaters 80-acre facility, known as the Big Spring Recycling System, water is brought in from drilling facilities owned by numerous commercial operators for recycling and return to the oilfield. The new facility was built with a daily capacity of about 250,000 barrels of recycled produced water, and able to inject about 100,000 barrels of water per day. Jason Jennaro, chief executive officer at Breakwater said the company aims to respond to the industrys growing desire to recycle its waste. More: Devon Energy merges with WPX Energy in $12 billion deal focused on Permian Basin oil ""Operators tell us all the time that they want to recycle 100 percent of their wastewater. But they either lack the ability to aggregate enough recycled water when they need it, or they are unable to distribute their water to others when they have too much,"" he said. ""We call our approach collaborative recycling. We're saving our customers money by integrating their entire water supply chains into a single multi-customer connection point which includes last mile recycled water distribution to the wellsite. Operators don't want to pay twice for the same water: once for completions and a second time for disposal."" More: Study shows billions of government relief dollars to oil and gas amid COVID-19 In the third quarter of 2020, Breakwater reported it recycled up to 5 million barrels of produced water while holding 1.5 million barrels of storage capacity. Breakwater has adopted a 'recycle first' water midstream model at a time when most of the industry's water is still discarded into saltwater disposals,"" Jennaro said. ""Breakwater has invested heavily in its last mile delivery capability, which affords us the flexibility to transfer high quantities of recycled water directly to customer's wellsite. More: Meanwhile, a Houston-based water management company purchased the water infrastructure assets owned by Cimarex Energy near Whites City in Eddy County. The purchase included 65 miles of pipeline and 100,000 bpd of disposal capacity. Cimarex also agreed to dedicate 15 acres in the area for gathering, disposal and recycling of produced water. We are excited to establish long-term alignment with Cimarex, a company which continues to demonstrate and build on its strong reputation as a thought leader in our industry, said Justin Love, chief executive officer of Blackbuck.

Produced water management in New Mexico could be lacking oversight, exposing people and the environment to poisonous chemicals and pollutants, per a recent study from Washington, D.C.-based environmental group Earthworks. About 1.4 million gallons of produced water was spilled in 2020 as of August, per the study which cited data from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) and its subsidiary Oil Conservation Divisions (OCD). More: The spillage in the first eight months of 2020 came from 327 incidents and would cover about 4.4 acres in wastewater, read the study. In 2019, records show 4 million gallons were spilled in 800 incidents. Melissa Troutman, Earthworks research and policy analyst said New Mexico must adopt stricter rules regarding the management of oil and gas wastewater, and that spills should be considered a violation of state law along with failure to report such incidents. More: New Mexico oil and gas permits challenged as Permian Basin ozone levels rise The organization filed a petition with the State of New Mexico that the OCD adopt a rulemaking to crack down on produced water spills. Troutman pointed to major oil companies such as XTO Energy, Devon Energy and Occidental Petroleum as major contributors to the problem. There is significant risk to public health in New Mexico from the oil and gas industry under the status quo, she said. Many oil and gas waste problems are preventable with common sense policy changes. More: Investments grow in the Permian Basin as oil and gas market shows signs of recovery Earthworks advocated for a halt in oil and gas leasing until regulations could be strengthened regarding wastewater management. Further oil and gas extraction under the status quo guarantees more pollution and risk to the environment and public health. This is why the best policy option is to halt any further oil and gas permitting in New Mexico, read a statement from Earthworks. However, with the likelihood of more extraction in addition to the legacy of waste coming from existing wells, swift protective measures are required to be enacted through legislation and/or regulatory rulemaking.

31,Oil and gas spending drop linked to competitiveness gap with the United States,nationalpost,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 07:15:00,"CALGARY  Canadas competitive disadvantage with the United States is being reflected in lower spending plans by oil and gas producers, and Tuesdays budget Oil and gas spending drop linked to competitiveness gap with the United States Back to video Spending is expected to be about $33.2 billion, down 12 per cent from 2017, with the biggest declines in the oilsands sector where spending will fall by a fifth to $10.2 billion, the federal agency said, citing a survey of investment intentions. It said the largest spending decline is anticipated in Alberta, down 12 per cent to $22.5 billion, but spending will also fall off in Newfoundland and Labrador, by 31 per cent to $1.7 billion; in British Columbia, by 8.7 per cent to $4.6 billion; and in Saskatchewan, by just under one per cent to $3.9 billion. The numbers are falling because big projects are wrapping up and not being replaced, a trend that also points to Canadas failing competitiveness with the United States, said CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld in an interview. The bigger picture is some Canadian companies are looking south of the border, he said. Theyre seeing the bottlenecks in the ability to get product to the market, the lighter regulatory environment in the U.S. and the disadvantage in spreads between U.S. and Canadian oil benchmarks  all are reasons to devote capital elsewhere.

Article content In Tuesdays federal budget, the government said more analysis was necessary before considering tax cuts to match the U.S., which announced in December it would drop its federal corporate tax rate to 21 per cent from 35 per cent. The finance minister says he wants to see evidence that Canada is losing its share of the corporate investment dollar to the U.S. and, if these numbers pan out, that could be part of the evidence that Ottawa needs to think about a response, said Shenfeld. Canada had a tax advantage over the U.S. until recently but that has evaporated, said University of Calgary tax expert Jack Mintz, adding there was absolutely nothing in the budget to address the issue. The decline in spending is also being seen by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, which estimates the industry will spend $45 billion this year, down about one per cent from 2017, and representing the fourth year of decline after $81 billion was spent in 2014. (CAPPs numbers include spending on exploration lands and other costs that Statistics Canada doesnt measure.) The four-year decline in oilsands spending in particular is the worst since the early 2000s and can be linked to uncertainty related to market access, the regulatory burden and competitiveness with the rest of the world, said CAPP vice-president Ben Brunnen. There are jurisdictions around the world that are actively trying to attract capital. Canada is not one of those, he said. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Brunnen said U.S. tax reform includes allowing immediate 100 per cent deductibility for certain capital expenditures, a move expected to spur investment in oil and gas, liquefied natural gas facilities and refineries  high-cost projects that compete directly with the oilsands for funding. Canada allows 30 per cent deductions for similar investments, he said. Depressed Alberta natural gas prices and Canadian oil prices that havent kept up with increases in the U.S. are forcing Canadian producers to cut spending plans this year, said Jackie Forrest, senior director of research at ARC Financial Corp. in Calgary. She said adjustments made over the past several weeks mean that she is changing her spending forecast for 2018 from a decline of two per cent to a drop of five per cent compared with 2017. Patrick ORourke, managing director of institutional research at AltaCorp Capital in Calgary, said executives at the energy companies he covers are more frustrated with increased regulation, carbon taxes and delays in building pipelines than income taxes. He said Tuesdays do-nothing budget failed to address any of those concerns. Follow @HealingSlowly on Twitter.

Ecoflight/courtesy photo A natural gas well pad sticks out in a snowy landscape above the Colorado River during a previous winter. Ecoflight/courtesy photo Hide Captions The town of Basalt is adding its voice to the debate over President Joe Bidens decision to temporarily stop leasing public lands for oil and gas exploration to create time to review long-term policies. The Town Council unanimously directed the staff to prepare a resolution in support of the pause for consideration at its next meeting on March 23. The issue was raised by council members Bill Infante and Elyse Hottel. While theres no threat of drilling on public lands in Basalts backyard, town officials said supporting the pause goes hand-in-hand with other recent actions related to climate change. It is completely consistent and supportive of our Declaration of a Climate Emergency and underscores our role in helping protect federal lands, Infante said. Basalt was among numerous local governments across the country that declared a climate emergency and vowed to weigh climate change in all its decision. Basalt took declared the emergency in 2019. Similarly to that action, Basalt isnt supporting the pause on oil and gas leasing in a vacuum. It was invited to lend its support by The Mountain Pact. That conservation group was formed to give a collective voice to mountain communities in the western United States on issues related to climate change. The Mountain Pact follows an opt-in model. Members such as Aspen, Snowmass Village, Basalt and Carbondale dont automatically support its initiatives. They have to take action in support of a Mountain Pact initiative. Executive director Anna Peterson said the organization has just started working with members on the issue and Basalt is furthest along. It is anticipated that other members will express support for the Biden administrations direction. At Tuesdays meeting, Infante praised The Mountain Pact for its leadership on environmental issues. I would also point out that the Mountain Pact has been a particularly effective partner to the town of Basalt in prior initiatives that will protect federal lands, will protect biodiversity, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and they are an organization and institution that deserves our support, he said. The Mountain Pact materials presented to the Basalt council said reviewing lease regulations on federal public lands would help the country protect its public lands more effectively and create a sustainable economy. Mountain Pact cited U.S. Department of the Interior information that said extraction of fossil fuels on pubic lands accounts for almost one-quarter of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. By pausing oil and gas leasing for the first time in 40 years, the Biden Administration rightly recognized the federal oil and gas leasing program is fundamentally broken and must be overhauled to address the climate crisis, generate a fair return for taxpayers, respect local landowners, and support communities in the inevitable transition away from fossil fuels, Mountain Pacts materials said. Bidens pause does not affect existing leases on public lands and does affect leasing on private lands at all. The Interior Department says that oil companies have stockpiled onshore leases for possible extraction in the future. There are about 26 million acres of public lands onshore that are leased to oil and gas companies. Almost 14 million acres are unused and non-producing, according to information circulated by the department. The pause on leasing is opposed by Colorado and national associations for oil and gas producers. The Biden administrations pause for review of oil and gas leasing policies was also condemned by U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, whose 3rd Congressional District includes the Roaring Fork Valley. Boebert, a Silt Republican, introduced a bill called the Protecting American Energy Jobs Act that attempts to nullify what she labeled Joe Bidens job-killing anti-energy mandates that will crush our District. The Interior Department announced March 9 that it would start the comprehensive review of leasing regulations on March 25 with a virtual forum. The day-long forum will feature several panels to highlight perspectives from industry representatives, labor and environmental justice organizations, natural resource advocates, and other experts, said a news release. Information gathered at the forum will help create an interim report that will be completed by early summer. It will outline recommendations and next steps for the department and Congress.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/basalt-council-supports-bidens-pause-on-oil-and-gas-leases-on-public-lands/
35,Oil and gas price shocks make producers hedge their bets with forward contracts,nationalpost,"Mar 12, 2021",2021-03-12 03:02:00,"CALGARY  Like gamblers who have been burned too often, Canadian energy producers are lining up to hedge their bets on oil and gas by locking in price Oil and gas price shocks make producers hedge their bets with forward contracts Back to video Hedging is a tactic used by energy producers and consumers to limit future price volatility. Producers sell contracts called futures, which consist of an agreement to sell some portion of a commodity at a set price. They can also offset potential losses through taking financial positions in the options market that are equal and opposite to their own holdings. Futures allow both producers and consumers to limit risk linked to energy prices, giving them a stronger foundation on which to budget and plan for the future. Companies hedge to reduce their No. 1 risk, that their oil and gas will be worth less in future than it is now, said Andy McConn, a Houston-based analyst for the company. A lot of these companies have long-term objectives predicated on prices of $50 or $55, he said. So when prices get above that, it gives them an opportunity to say, OK, well lock this in, that will give us confidence to budget and plan to hit these strategic targets. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content He said producers want to make sure there will be money in the bank before signing deals with contractors and suppliers  and their bankers want the same assurance. I think producers in general for years in Canada shied away from hedging because it was never rewarded, said Martin King, a commodity analyst at GMP FirstEnergy of Calgary, in a recent interview. But I think the investment community and producers are starting to wrap their arms around the idea of hedging more barrels, or molecules of gas, simply because they have to. You have to show yourself as being more financially capable, guard the bottom line, guard cash flows, guard capital expenditure programs. A Wood Mackenzie analysis of hedging activity by 33 of the largest global upstream companies with active programs found that they had added about 900,000 barrels per day of new oil hedges in the third quarter of 2017, up 150 per cent from the previous quarter and the highest volume of hedges added in a single quarter since at least 2015. The simplest hedging contracts are for physical delivery and are struck between the producer and the consumer, an oil refinery or a natural gas utility company, for instance. The deals guarantee future supply at a set price. Other hedges are financial contracts where the commodity doesnt actually change hands and the deals are usually settled before their due date. After one of the most volatile years ever for natural gas pricing in 2017, CEO Darren Gee of Peyto Exploration and Development said his mid-sized Calgary gas company has become much more defensive. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Three or four years ago, we might have hedged 50 per cent. Now, were targeting closer to 80 to 85 per cent, he said. Were not trying to win or lose on the strategy. Its just smoothing out what we see to be more extreme volatility in the natural gas price. Other Calgary producers including Encana Corp. and Crescent Point Energy Corp. are also active hedgers. On the other hand, Suncor Energy Inc., Canadas largest oil, gas and refining company by market capitalization, doesnt hedge at all. Spokeswoman Erin Rees said the company is protected by its integrated business model  when oil prices are low, profit margins at its refineries tend to grow because of the cheap feedstock. Theres a lot at stake. In a recent report, RBC Capital Markets analyst Greg Pardy pointed out that because oilsands giant Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. doesnt hedge, a US$10 per barrel change in benchmark oil prices could make its 2018 cash flow  a key measure of its ability to fund future growth  rise or fall by 36 per cent or $3.3 billion. The Alberta government doesnt hedge, either, although the royalties it collects from producer companies are paid in kind, literally with the equivalent of barrels of oil and cubic feet of gas. Its royalty revenue from non-renewable resources (oil, gas and coal) has varied from $11.6 billion in 2011-12 to $2.8 billion in 2015-16. It is forecast to earn $3.85 billion in the current fiscal year. Alberta Finance spokesman Mike Berezowsky said the government instead accounts for the possibility of lower-than-projected resource revenue with a risk adjustment factor  it subtracts US$10 per barrel from the private sector oil price forecasts it uses when making assumptions for its annual budgets. Tim Pickering, founder of Auspice Capital in Calgary, said refusing to hedge prices has cost the Alberta government billions in lost revenue. Under Albertas sliding royalty model, it collects fewer barrels of oil when the price is low, which means it kinda gets hit twice when prices tank, he said. Follow @HealingSlowly on Twitter.

Oil & Gas Crude oil declines, but stays near $70 as demand recovery hopes lend support Front-month Brent is on track to post weekly gains for the eighth week after touching a 13-month high on Monday following attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. Reuters March 12, 2021, 08:05 IST SINGAPORE: Brent crudeprices eased on Friday but hovered near $70 a barrel as production cuts by major oil producers constrained supply, with optimism about a recovery in demand for the resource in the second half of the year also lending support. Brent crude futures for May slipped 17 cents, or 0.2%, to $69.46 a barrel by 0109 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for April was at $65.79 a barrel, down 23 cents, or 0.4%. Front-month Brent is on track to post weekly gains for the eighth week after touching a 13-month high on Monday following attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. Sentiment was also buoyed by the decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, earlier this month to largely hold production cuts in April. Investors have been pumping funds into commodities such as oil on expectations of a demand recovery in the second half of the year as the global economy grows while a wider rollout of vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic allows more people to travel this summer. ""Assuming vaccination programmes are successful, we expect pent-up demand for gasoline to be released this summer during the U.S. and European driving season,"" FGE analysts said in a note. RBC Capital analysts said the fundamentals for summer gasoline is the most bullish in nearly a decade. ""We think this will support the entire oil complex this summer and beyond."" The United States, world's largest oil consumer, saw a massive draw on U.S. gasoline stocks last week as the winter storm in Texas disrupted refining output.

In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said demandwill rise by 5.89 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2021, or 6.5%, up slightly from last month. But the group cut its forecasts for the first half. ""Total oil demand is foreseen to reach 96.3 million bpd with most consumption appearing in the second half,"" OPEC said in the report. ""This year's demand growth will not be able to compensate for the major shortfall from 2020 as mobility is forecast to remain impaired throughout 2021."" The latest forecasts could bolster cautious views among OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on how quickly to unwind more of last year's record oil output cuts. OPEC+ last week decided to mostly extend current cuts into April. OPEC raised its forecast of world economic growth this year to 5.1% from 4.8%, although it sees the pandemic's impact lingering in the first half. The report also showed lower OPEC oil output in February as most OPEC+ members returned to output restraint and Saudi Arabiapledged a voluntary cut of 1 million bpd in February and March, which last week was extended into April. OPEC said its output fell by 650,000 bpd to 24.85 million bpd, driven by the Saudi cut. Riyadh told OPEC it made almost all of the reduction, lowering production by 956,000 bpd to 8.147 million bpd.

View Comments New Mexicos oil and gas industry was poised to be a major influencer in the states politics going into the 2020 General Election and subsequent January 2021 Legislative Session. Even as the industry struggled to recover from historic losses brought on by the COVID-19 health crisis, records show oil and gas companies and associated groups contributed thousands of dollars during the 2020 election cycle to political campaigns and other activities throughout New Mexico. During the first campaign reporting period of the 2020 election, running from June 30 to Sept. 7, the industry spent about $900,000 on political activities in the state, per a recent study from New Mexico Ethics Watch. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. In those two months, 183 individuals associated with oil and gas made contributions, the study read, compared to about 500 the organization identified between 2017 and 2019. Of the contributions tied to the oil and gas sector, businesses made about $564,000 in direct contributions to New Mexico candidates, committees or political action committees (PACs), read the study. Another $211,000 came from individuals associated with the industry, while oil and gas PACs gave $86,000 and lobbying organizations tied to the industry gave about $31,000. More: Torres Small, Herrell clash ahead of election to New Mexico US House seat Chevron Energy made one of the highest contributions among oil and gas companies, the study showed, giving either directly or through Chevrons PACs about $388,000 to state politicians, combining with about $900,000 the company gave during the June Primary Election. Chevrons contributions dwarfed other major business contributors, the study showed, with other top donators Strata Production Company giving $36,000 and the Jalapeno Corporation give $24,000. Chevron mostly gave to Republicans, records show, donating $175,650 or 68 percent of its $258,000 in candidate contributions to the party.

Industry-wide, about $456,000 or 76 percent of oil and gas $603,000 donated to candidates went to GOP candidates, the study read. Kathleen Sabo, executive director of New Mexico Ethics Watch said it was clear that oil and gas had continued to be a strong influence of New Mexico politics even as the state grappled with an economic downturn brought on by the pandemic. More: Report: New Mexico oil and gas industry spends millions to influence state politics At a time when so many New Mexicans are struggling financially, its amazing to see industries, such as oil and gas, still pumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into political campaigns, Sabo said. Though the pandemic has seriously slowed New Mexicos economy, it appears that COVID-19 hasnt slowed the flow of money from the oil industry into the coffers of our politicians. But State Sen. Gay Kernan (R-42) said the industry deserves to have a voice in the states decision making as it is a key economic driver in New Mexico. More: BLM seeking input on April 2021 oil and gas lease sale despite opposition amid COVID-19 Kernan, who is running unopposed for the seat shes held since 2002, was listed in the study as one of top five candidates receiving oil and gas contributions at $17,000 in donations during the first reporting time frame for the 2020 General Election. She was joined on the list by Isabella Solis, a Republican from Dona Ana County running for the New Mexico Houses District 37 at $27,000, Republican Robert Godshall running for House District 27 who received $25,000, Crystal Diamond who won the GOP nomination to the Senates and received $22,325 and Giovanni Coppola who is running for the Houses District 68 and received $20,500 from the oil and gas industry. Kernan pointed to more than 40 percent of the states budget coming from oil and gas, and argued the industrys needs should be considered by lawmakers to keep such revenue strong in New Mexico. More: Oil and gas leaders discuss industry's struggles amid COVID-19 at Energy Summit Its important for them to have a voice because we need to continue the oil and gas industry in New New Mexico, Kernan said. Everyone understands the revenue that comes in. That affects all of New Mexico. Representing southeast New Mexico counties such as Eddy and Lea where the states oil and gas operations are mostly focused, Kernan said, means telling the story of extractions contributions to the state in funding public services such as infrastructure and education. We do the best we can as representatives of the area to make sure our colleagues across the state understand the industry, she said. More: Oil and gas industry, environmentalists voice criticism of New Mexico's methane rules But the financial contributions for the industry to her campaign, Kernan said, doesnt mean shes beholden to the industry. I get contributions from companies and industries, but I dont always support whey they do, she said. In my view, were under no obligation to do anything except be the best legislator we can be. I am obligated only to my constituents. Without having to run a major campaign as she faces no opposition in November, Kernan said her campaign funds would be used to support other candidates that she said understand the importance of oil and gas and economic development in the southeast. I certainly have raised a good amount of money and have used it to help candidates in my area, she said. Those are people that understand the value of oil and gas.

Digital Oilfield How to Prepare for an Oil and Gas Industry Driven by Data Data is very quickly replacing oil and gas as the most important resource in the energy sector. Here are the benefits of using a centralized database from Midland, Texas-based upstream software provider Enertia Software. Fernando Salazar, Enertia Software Thu, 03/11/2021 - 12:00 PM Getting information from remote locations and into the hands of decision-makers is one challenge to building a data-driven company in the oil and gas industry. (Source: Shutterstock.com) Your browser does not support the audio element. Extracting a volatile substance from a remote location on a massive scale and with maximum efficiency takes one resource above all others: innovation. Cutting-edge technology and new techniqueshave always helped the oil and gas industry overcome insurmountable obstacles and achieve what seems impossible. Now, the industry is in the midst of a new wave of advancement that eclipses anything that came before. Technologies like artificial intelligence, augmented reality and surveying drones bring exciting capabilities to the oil and gas industry. They also each serve as invaluable sources of data into all aspects of operations. Thanks to the explosion of data, its possible to measure, capture, store and analyze more information than ever before. Essentially, this flow of data helps companies know the unknowable. And in a highly speculative industry like oil and gas, thats an obvious (and tremendous) advantage. The average company manages almost 163 terabytes of data and that number is only climbing. Countless valuable insights live inside that datalike how to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, where to invest precious resources and when to be worried about renewablesbut theyre not easy to find and interpret. The oil and gas companies that use data effectively wont always see automatic results. But if theyre systemic about refining their data, it will become an invaluable resource that propels them into the future. Building a Data-Driven Company The most important data sources for an oil and gas company may be located in far-flung locations or on pipelines that stretch for miles on end. Getting information from those remote locations and into the hands of decision-makers is one challenge to building a data-driven company. Validation is another: For data to be insightful and trustworthy enough to act on, the underlying information must be free of errors and omissions. Preserving the datas integrity takes a comprehensive effort to convert, validate, cleanse and map it. Once a company knows all the places that data flows into, it must create links between those sources. Without those links, it would take much longer to analyze the data, and the analysis would suffer from information deficits. More data is always better, but anything less than all the data is cause for concern. Also worrying is the risk of hackers compromising repositories of valuable data. The oil and gas industry must put robust cybersecurity measures in place that keep data locked downwithout making access difficult for employees in the process. To achieve this, companies must walk a fine line or face the consequences if they fail in either direction. The Benefits of Putting Data First Data may be an asset, but as this makes clear, its challenging to manage. However, as oil and gas companies increasingly drive success using data and technologyover heavy equipment and expansive extraction sites, companies that dont evolve wont remain competitive. To make the initiative attractive to all stakeholders, consider the benefits of running a company with a centralized database of all the best information available. 1. Improved decision-making: Data from multiple sources integrated in one place gives decision-makers the 360-degree perspective they need to choose their next steps wisely. Nothing guarantees correct decision-making every time, but companies make the right choices far more often when they have an expansive information repository to draw from. Every question has an answer, and no uncertainty lasts for long with centralized data. 2. Consistent performance: When an oil and gas company has sites and workers spread across multiple locations, theres a high risk for miscommunication and poor coordination. Centralized data arms everyone with the same information, so they have a consistent understanding of whats happening. Not only does everyone have a shared set of facts to work from, but they also can stop searching all over for the information they need. 3. Resource optimization: Few companies have the time or staff to spare on complicated data management. When its done automaticallyguided by best practices for collection and organizationemployees can spend less time preparing information and more time putting it to good use. 4. Elevated performance: Data is easier to extract when it lives in a centralized location. Whatever users need to access comes to them on-demand, along with whatever contextual data they need to enhance their understanding. Therefore, companies save time and money on data management by centralizing their information. They can save even more by using that data to elevate efficiency, productivity, profitability or any other KPI. It may sound unbelievable, but data is very quickly replacing oil and gas as the most important resource in the energy sector. Some companies will debate or resist that fact. Others will get on board and make data their new priority. Its not hard to predict which of these companies will fare better in the energy economy of the future.

Pay attention to what PennFuture calls an oil and gas 'subsidy' Gene Yaw | Erie Times-News The group Citizens for Pennsylvanias Future, also known as PennFuture, recently released a report entitled Buried Out of Sight: Uncovering Pennsylvanias Hidden Fossil Fuel Subsidies. More: ""Buried out of sight: Uncovering Pennsylvania's hidden fossil fuel subsidies"" This Harrisburg-based organization is dedicated to lobbying against Pennsylvania energy and responsible use of natural resources. Interestingly, PennFuture  a registered nonprofit organization  also has a nearly 40% ownership interest in a for-profit company that invests in energy efficiency and renewables. This ownership interest can pay PennFuture up to nearly $200,000 annually and begs questions about their impartiality. With respect to their report, it is worth highlighting some of the examples that PennFuture regards as a subsidy for Pennsylvanias fossil fuel industry. Most of these subsidies are in fact calls for higher taxes directly on Pennsylvania citizens  not businesses. For example, PennFuture considers these to be subsidies of big oil and gas:  $1 billion because Pennsylvania does not levy the 6% sales tax on the sale of gasoline and diesel. This calculation conveniently ignores that Pennsylvania imposes the highest liquid fuels tax in the nation in lieu of a sales tax. It is difficult to comprehend how not imposing a 6% sales tax on consumers at the pump  because Pennsylvania already has a separate gasoline tax  constitutes a subsidy for the fossil fuel industry.  $1.06 billion because Pennsylvania does not impose a property tax on oil and gas ownership interests by landowners. PennFuture again argues that not imposing a specific kind of tax is a subsidy, while again conveniently ignoring that any property tax that is imposed would fall on Pennsylvania landowners  not the fossil fuel industry.  $169 million for not imposing the 6% sales tax on homeowners who heat with fuel oil. Put simply: when a low-income homeowner receives a shipment of fuel oil to heat their home for the winter, and does not pay sales tax on that transaction, PennFuture regards that as a subsidy for the oil and gas industry.  $260 million for not imposing the 6% sales tax on electricity use by homeowners, businesses, and nonprofits. This again conveniently ignores that Pennsylvania instead imposes a gross receipts tax on electric bills. Imposing the sales tax would be double-taxation, and this burden would fall directly on Pennsylvania citizens. $305 million for not imposing the gross receipts tax on natural gas home energy use. Again, PennFuture regards the lack of a specific tax on Pennsylvania consumers to be a subsidy for the fossil fuel industry while ignoring that any gross receipts tax in Pennsylvania would be fully recoverable directly from consumers. This fails on two fronts not imposing a tax is counted as a subsidy, and ignoring that any such tax, again, if imposed falls squarely on individual citizens, and is recoverable under the Public Utility Code. It cannot reasonably be referred to as a subsidy for the oil and gas industry. PennFuture, in its tales about the fossil fuel industry, ignores one crucial fact  there is not a clean or green energy undertaking on the planet, which does not depend on fossil fuels at some point. Stated simply, without fossil fuel there is no clean or green energy. In an effort to advance an energy agenda that is not in line with the needs of Pennsylvanians, some will distort the truth with misinformation, hoping that you do not pay attention to the details. It is clear that the overwhelming majority of subsidies identified here would, if eliminated, simply impose billions of dollars of new taxes directly on the citizens that we represent. State Sen. Gene Yaw, of Williamsport, R-23rd Dist., is Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee chairman.",http://timesonline.com/story/opinion/2021/03/11/pennfuture-misses-mark-oil-and-gas-subsidies/6874836002/

Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn BISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - Uncertainty, volatility, and disruption: these key words describe the difficult year the nations energy industry has undergone. And North Dakotas is no different. Oil and gas industry leaders have had to maneuver through a tough year, which started by being put in the middle of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and is ending with an administration keen on ensuring clean energy trumps fossil fuels, effectively shutting down the Keystone XL Pipeline and leaving producers uncertain of Dakota Access future. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia was the first sign of trouble, leaving North Dakota in the middle and causing a fall in oil production. All of this hit right before the state had its first COVID-19 case. As quarantine began and travel stopped, demand for oil dropped to a historic low. Having nowhere else to go, storage tanks filled with oil. Weve never been at this level at this time of the year in history, said Department of Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms on March 15, 2020. WTI market price then dropped from an already unstable $20 a barrel to just 20 cents. Nobody expected crude oil to drop to basically a penny, said North Dakota Petroleum Council President Ron Ness. The price then shockingly dipped even lower to negative $37 a barrel. The Petroleum Councils Ron Ness recounts this moment. You start worrying about, are we going to have to shut everything down? And from there it just escalated into people having to lay people off and shut down their rigs, shut down their activities, so it was a pretty incredible shock. I would say there was shock and awe to all of us, said Ness. Theres been about 13,000 unemployment claims since the beginning of the pandemic in the energy sector alone, mostly stemming from the Bakken area. One rig worker reflects on this past years drop in production compared to 2015. When it died out the last time it shut down fast, but not this fast, said former rig consultant Kevin Syverson, whose worked in the oil and gas sector in the Bakken for nearly 40 years. Industry leaders and producers are still uncertain what a full recovery will look like, but believe they wont see a hint of it until sometime next year. Under a Biden administration, Ness said the state may be pushed to focus on renewable energy, but said North Dakota has been a leader in ensuring our energy sources are clean ones.

Thats high, given its population in 2019 represented just 11.7 per cent of all provinces. On the opposite end is Quebec. Between 2008 and 2019, Quebec spent less than many provinces in most years and always less than Alberta. Quebecs spending ranged from $179 per person in 2008 to $273 in 2019. That was lower than the Maritimes, Ontario, Saskatchewan and British Columbia in most years. Albertas per capita environmental spending ranged from $334 in 2010 to $653 per person in 2016, far higher than Quebec in those and other years. Per person, Alberta has outspent the average in the other nine provinces every year since 2008. The range was 41 per cent to 180 per cent more depending on the year. Between 2006 and 2018 (Statistics Canada collects the data every second year), Canadas oil and gas sector spent $28.1 billion on environmental protection, capital and operating expenses combined. Heres how that compares to other major industries: electric power generation, $6.3 billion; mining and quarrying, $6.2 billion; primary metal manufacturing, $6.1 billion; chemical manufacturing, $3 billion. A variety of other industries with smaller expenditures collectively spent $18 billion, according to Statistic Canada. So of the $67.7 billion in environmental spending between 2006 and 2018, and even with gap years in the data, the oil and gas sector spent $28.1 billion or 41.5 per cent. All other industries combined spent $39.6 billion or 58.5 per cent. One response might be that the oil and gas industry incurs significant disruption to the environment and thus might be expected to spend significant sums in exchange. But its not clear, for example, what the liability would be for the automotive sector if every car factory and dealership was required to return the disturbed earth to its original condition. Or if hydro dams were required to be dismantled after 50 or 100 years, and land and rivers returned to their natural, pre-dam states. The oil and gas sector is tasked with doing what few other industries must do. That makes comprehensive industry-to-industry comparisons nearly impossible  unless all other sectors are also required to return land and waterways as close as possible to their pre-disturbed states. Canadas oil and gas sector has long spent far and above every other industry. And Alberta has almost always spent more per capita than any other province (the lone exception is 2009, when Nova Scotia spent $353 versus $343 per person in Alberta).

43,Oil Giant Shell Appoints New Chairman to Navigate Energy Transition,wsj,"Mar 11, 2021",2021-03-11 13:30:00,"Shell has appointed Andrew Mackenzie as its new chairman, tapping a mining veteran to oversee the oil and gas giant as it navigates the transition to low-carbon energy. sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com Updated March 11, 2021 8:30 am ET LONDON Royal Dutch Shell  PLC has appointed Andrew Mackenzie as its new chairman, tapping a mining veteran to oversee the oil and gas giant as it navigates the transition to low-carbon energy. The Anglo-Dutch company said Thursday that Mr. Mackenzie, who joined its board as a nonexecutive director in October, would succeed outgoing chairman Chad Holliday in May. A Scottish-born geologist, Mr. Mackenzie is best known as the former chief executive of BHP Group Ltd., one of the worlds largest mining companies, which he ran for six years to 2019. During his tenure at BHP, he is credited with simplifying its business, overseeing the sale of its U.S. shale-gas assets and carving out several mining operations into a new company called  South32 Ltd. Before that, Mr. Mackenzie worked at rival miner Rio Tinto PLC, and previously spent 22 years at  BP  PLC, in areas including research and development, petrochemicals, and exploration and production. Mr. Mackenzies appointment at Shell comes as many big oil companies are grappling with the transition away from fossil fuels toward lower-carbon energy like wind and solar power. Governments and companies are increasingly moving to reduce reliance on fossil fuels to curb carbon emissions, while growing technologies like electric vehicles are expected to dampen future demand for diesel and gasoline.

View Comments Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit New Mexico, its oil and gas industry was a major driver of economic growth in the state, supporting billions of dollars to the states economy and more than 100,000 jobs. A new report released last month by the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA) reported that in 2018, oil and gas provided 134,000 instate jobs and $16.6 billion to the states economy. The industrys activity in New Mexico accounted for 12 percent on statewide employment and 16 percent of New Mexicos economy, per the study. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. Ryan Flynn, NMOGA executive director said that for the industry to continue driving the economic growth in the state, policies must be supportive of its growth and lawmakers should avoid creating unduly burdensome regulations. The oil and natural gas industry supports jobs and local economies in every corner of our state, and this report underscores the employment ripple effect inherent in this industry when it is allowed to be successful, said Flynn said. New Mexicos economic outlook and future generations depend on continuing policies that prioritize the development of our abundant energy resources, just as we have safely done for the past several years. The result is a stronger, more resilient New Mexico for everyone. More: Study shows billions of government relief dollars to oil and gas amid COVID-19 Jobs in the oil and gas sector represented $7.6 billion in labor income in 2018, the report read, and accounted for 14 percent of labor income across New Mexico. One in every seven government jobs were supported by the industry, read the report, mostly in state and local government. That led to $2.2 billion in state and local tax payments, the report read, or 25 percent of the states total payments. More: Oil and gas wastewater investments continue in Permian Basin, group calls for stricter rules Eddy and Lea counties in the Permian Basin had the most value added from oil and gas at $3.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, followed by San Juan County in the northwestern San Juan Basin at $2.4 billion and Bernalillo at about $2.1 billion in added value, the study read. Bernalillo which contains New Mexicos largest metropolitan area of Albuquerque received the most labor income dollars in the state from oil and gas at about $1.3 billion, followed by Eddy and Lea at about $1.3 billion each. Bernalillo also had the most jobs supported by the industry at 25,866 jobs, followed by Lea at 18,329, Eddy at 16,572 and San Juan at 14,180 jobs. More: Oil and gas contributes thousands of dollars to New Mexico politics in 2020 General Election Flynn pointed to a recent analysis from the American Petroleum Institute commissioned by NMOGA that found a ban on federal oil and gas leasing would have severe consequence for the Land of Enchantment. Such a move, as many worried would be enacted by Democrat Presidential Nominee and former-Vice President Joe Biden, would cost New Mexico 62,000 jobs by 2022, the report read. Any government effort to stymie oil and gas production in New Mexico, Flynn said, would take funds away from public services such as healthcare and education. More: BLM seeking input on April 2021 oil and gas lease sale despite opposition amid COVID-19 Smart, sound policy is critical to the success of our industry and has a clear impact on other sectors of the economy supported by oil and natural gas, he said. The fact that industry supports one of every seven government jobs shows that New Mexico just cant afford misguided proposals like a federal leasing ban that put teachers, first responders, and health care workers on the chopping block. Looking ahead to coming years as the world recovers from COVID-19, the study also warned that the state could see significant declines in fiscal year 2021 in gross revenue from oil and gas as reported on severance tax returns. More: Oil and gas leaders discuss industry's struggles amid COVID-19 at Energy Summit The study said FY 2021 would see 40 percent less in such revenue compared with 2018, as active drilling rigs were currently at about half the level reported in 2018. State and local taxes derived from the industry will also be significantly lower, the study read. Based on these trends, the level of economic activity supported by the industry is likely to be significantly lower in the coming year than that presented in this report for (2018). Data from Baker Hughes showed New Mexico had 45 active rigs as of Oct. 9, while the state averaged 101 in October 2018 and 112 on October 2019. More: Oil and gas industry, New Mexico works to curb greenhouse gas emissions, fight climate change New Mexico started 2020 at similar levels to the past years, averaging 106 rigs in January and 114 in February and March. A drastic decline in oil and gas activity led by a massive drop in the value of fossil fuel created by the pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions saw rigs drop in New Mexico to an average of 87 in April, 65 in May, 54 in June, and 49 in July. The downward trend continued in the late summer and early fall as August averaged 46 active rigs in New Mexico, records show, and September had an average of 44 rigs. More: Devon Energy merges with WPX Energy in $12 billion deal focused on Permian Basin oil Analysts pointed to mild recovery of the industry over the summer, as crude oil prices rebounded from an historic drop to less than $0 per barrel in April as the pandemic spread across the U.S. to hover at about $40 per barrel in the following months. But that momentum appeared to weaken, read a report from Enverus, as the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a grade of crude used as a domestic pricing benchmark, struggled to overcome the $40 per barrel range throughout the fall. Crude oil prices recovered steadily over the summer as demand for transportation fuels (except for jet) rebounded from the lows of April-May. Unfortunately, the demand recovery has since lost momentum, and WTI is currently struggling to tread water at $40 per barrel, the study read. The partial recovery in gasoline demand over the summer driving season in the United States was a critical support for the crude complex, but now demand for gasoline is settling into a long winter's nap.

View Comments A bill that would create a state task force dedicated to shifting New Mexico away from fossil fuels gained momentum in the State House this week after passing the Senate earlier in the ongoing 2021 Legislative Session. Senate Bill 112 would establish New Mexicos Sustainable Economy Task Force which would work to find ways to diversify the states economy beyond its reliance on the oil and gas industry for state funds. Those in favor of the measure argued that during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent collapse of fossil fuels markets, it became ever-more evident that relying on oil and gas extraction was risky as the industry is prone to dramatic booms and busts. More: New Mexico House continues momentum for solar bill to expand access to renewable energy Oil and gas entered a boom period in 2017 and by 2019, the state had a budget surplus of about $2 billion many credited to the increased production of fossil fuel in New Mexico. But as the pandemic took hold, fuel demands dropped, and the state was left with an about $400 million deficit. Oil and gas accounts for about a third of New Mexicos budget, and sponsor Sen. Mimi Steward (D-17) defended SB 112 during numerous hearing, arguing it was not against oil and gas but supported the states efforts to find more industries to prop up its presently volatile economy.

More: New Mexico regulators tangle over oil and gas pipeline authority via Senate bill Membership on the task force would be made up of representatives from state cabinet-level agencies, stakeholders and members of the public, and it would be tasked with providing annual reports and recommendations to lawmakers. Jon Clark, deputy secretary of the New Mexico Economic Development Department said the Department supported the bill as it could provide a boon to New Mexicos economic diversity. He said the Department received a $1.5 million grant from the federal Economic Development Administration to assist with short-term economic recovery efforts amid the pandemic and for long-term diversification, and that the task force could assist in such planning.

Artemisio Romero y Carver, of Youth United for Climate Crisis Action (YUCCA) said SB 112 was part of necessary, broader effort to transition New Mexico away from fossil fuels and address pollution and climate change concerns. He said New Mexico produces more than twice the national average of greenhouse gasses per capita, attributable to its heavy oil and gas development, particularly in the Permian Basin in the southeast corner of the state.

The company reported total revenues in 2020 of $180.5 billion, down 47% on 2019's figure of $344.8 billion, a reflection of lower oil prices and reduced production because of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and restrictions put in place by OPEC. Ben van Beurden, the chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell, said: 'The virus also wreaked havoc with the global economy, dramatically suppressing energy demand. Our income went from $16.4 billion in 2019 to a loss of $21.5 billion in 2020, which included non-cash impairments of $28.1 billion.' He added that in April, with oil prices falling rapidly, Shell took 'swift, decisive action to preserve cash and stay resilient'. Mr van Beurden said: 'We rebased the dividend, lowering it by 66%. In October, with global energy demand looking more robust, we raised the dividend by 4% and signalled our intention to have annual dividend increases, subject to Board approval.' Despite the unprecedented challenges, Shell delivered cash flow from operating activities of $34.1 billion in 2020, compared with $42.2 billion in 2019.

View Comments New Mexico state oil and gas regulators released the final version of proposed emissions regulations and petitioned for a hearing to finalize the rules. The Oil Conservation Division (OCD) and its parent agency the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) began work on enacting stricter regulations on gas emissions from extraction facilities last year as mandated by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham through an executive order. At the start of her administration, Lujan Grisham established the States Climate Change Task Force, made up of EMNRD and the New Mexico Environment Department to find ways state operations and laws could be used or developed to reduce pollution in New Mexico and its impact on climate change. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. The rule released Thursday followed a 60-day public review and comment period, along with public hearings held since summer 2019. Using feedback gained from the hearings and reviews, the OCD sought a final hearing with the Oil Conservation Commission where Commission members would vote whether to make the rules law. The proposed rule would require both upstream and midstream oil and gas operators to capture 98 percent of their natural gas by 2026, rather than releasing the gas through venting or burning it off via flaring. More: Study shows billions of government relief dollars to oil and gas amid COVID-19 Methane emissions from the oil and gas industry makes up the largest portion of New Mexicos greenhouse gas emissions, read a news release from the OCD. The rules also created new requirements for pipeline operations but were also intended to allow companies to develop their own gas capture technologies and increase data requirements to aid in the 98 percent gas capture goal. The first phase of the new regulations will focus on gathering data and increasing reporting requirements for operations, aimed at finding sources of gas emissions at ever stage of the industry. More: Oil and gas wastewater investments continue in Permian Basin, group calls for stricter rules Venting and flaring, typically routine actions in the industry, were defined as waste in the new rules and operators were required to report all instances of either practice to the state and owners of the mineral estate where the releases took place. The second stage will use the data gathered in the first to develop steps operators must take to achieve the capture goal in the next six years. Operators would determine for themselves how the 98 percent gas capture goal would be reached, and incentives would be offered by the State for the development of new gas capture technologies. More: Before COVID-19, oil and gas' drove economy in New Mexico, struggles to continue in 2021 Credits would be offered to operators who detect and fix natural gas leaks at their own facilities. Operators will be required to cut emissions by a fixed amount every year with limited exceptions, the release read, for emergencies. Companies that fail to meet gas capture targets could be subjected to enforcement actions such as fines or well shut-ins. More: New Mexico investigating possible drilling mud spill at Higby Hole near Malaga The rule would also create new requirements for approving drilling permits, which could see permits denied for operators that fail to comply with gas capture specifications. Stripper wells, or low-producing wells that produce less than 10 barrels per day, less than 60,000 cubic feet of gas per day or have the potential to emit les than 15 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) per year would see some exceptions from the rules related to inspections and retrofits, but such facilities would still be held to the 98 percent capture goal as other operators.

Print The ageing offshore oil and gas monuments stood proud over the vast Australian coast, where they played their part in powering the nationnow, they face a destiny of destruction. The Centre of Decommissioning Australia (CODA) announced on March 10 that it had set a target that will see the expensive oil and gas infrastructure removed over a 50-year process, in an effort to reduce the sizable $52.9 billion (USD $40.5 billion) price tag. The removal comes not as a result of carbon emission reduction policies, but as part of an existing plan to decommission old oil and gas structures that have reached the end of their designated lifespan. Decommissioning of assets and development of new assets is a normal part of any industry and its development cycle, an Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) spokesperson told The Epoch Times in an email. Were expecting the Australian oil and gas industry to continue to grow, the spokesperson said. As of October 2020, the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources reported around $137 billion worth of projects are in the investment pipeline. These projects are expected to create tens of thousands of jobs, the spokesperson said. Australian resources giant Woodsides Goodyn, an offshore gas production platform in the North West Shelf gas project, which produces a third of Australias oil and half of its natural gas, off the northwest coast of Australia on Jan. 01, 2001. (-/AFP via Getty Images) National Energy Resources Australia (NERA) launched CODA based on a reportby Advisian detailing the large costs associated with dismantling efforts. A coalition of seven oil and gas operators, including BHP, Chevron, and Woodside, funded the report which then launched the program. CODA allows for the companies to reduce the otherwise unavoidable costs associated with the decommissioning process, thus it is in their interest, as NERAs Decommissioning General Manager Andrew Taylor noted. All of these companies are required to carry decommissioning liabilities on their books, so its in their interest to engage in a collaborative way to find a more efficient way to do this work, Taylor told the Australian Associated Press. The report supports a possible cost reduction of $7.9 to $10.5 billion (US$6.1 to 8.1 billion), premised on the implementation of multiple cost-reducing opportunities. One such major opportunity is to avoid the removal and transport of pipelines. The report suggests disconnecting and cleaning pipelines as required, but then re-burying them as is, with the strategy alone estimated to save 15 percent, or $7.7 billion (US$5.9 billion). Natural gas is being viewed as a crucial component to Australias goal in reducing carbon emissions, goals that have been set forth by Australias promises in line with the Paris Agreement. According to a visionby the APPEA, natural gas is integral to a low carbon Australian economy due to its considerably lower carbon emissions when compared with coal. It also stated that increased use of natural gas has several environmental benefits, including reduced emissions of fine particulates, as well as reduced emissions of both sulphur dioxide (a primary contributor to smog and acid rain) and nitrogen oxides. Demand for natural gas, especially liquefied natural gas (LNG), is forecast to grow in the coming years. Growing global demand for natural gas, particularly in Asian economies is driving increasing LNG export volumes, the APPEA spokesperson said.",https://www.theepochtimes.com/coalition-of-australian-oil-and-gas-giants-face-52-9-billion-decommission_3727552.html

In fiscal year 2020, the commission plugged 1,477 orphan wells to exceed the Texas legislatures targetof 1,400, according to Keese. RRCs program is funded through industry revenue including, but not limited to, well plugging reimbursements, fees and financial securities paid by the industry, Keese wrote. No general taxpayer money is used. While the states Oil and Gas Regulation and Cleanup Fund has grown its revenue from $64.1 million in 2015 to $139 million in 2020, the Railroad Commission must set aside revenues from bonds and other financial assurances, according to the Commission Shift report. This limits access to cleanup funding, leading the commission to request funds from the Texas General Revenue Fund for well plugging and remediation in 2022. Operators are not explicitly required to plug and permanently shut down inactive wells, and do not have to remove wellhead equipment from the surface until the well has been inactive for 10 years, according to Commission Shift. Rising costs from fracking wells Palacios, who launched Commission Shift this month after several years as an environmental analyst, said the problems surrounding abandoned wells are likely to outgrow the commissions existing funding sources. One reason is that wells drilled with hydraulic fracturing or horizontal drilling methods leave larger amounts of chemicals behind and are much deeper than traditional oil and gas wells. The cost of plugging a hydraulically fractured well and a deeper well is much higher, and we have not updated the bonding program to account for that higher cost, Palacios said. Her organization is pushing for reforms to push companies to take care of their inactive wells themselves before the cleanup costs are passed to the Railroad Commission. Those recommendations include potentially increasing fees and bonding requirements for companies, which Palacios argues would deter operators from leaving inactive wells unplugged and shedding liability if they go bankrupt later. Oil and gas industry groups have argued that these recommendations would put too much financial pressure on small producers, which the Commission Shift report found to be more likely to cause environmental incidents. Todd Staples, president of the Texas Oil & Gas Association, said in a statement that companies are following some of the most stringent laws in the nation related to plugging wells, leading companies to pay to plug 7,375 wells last year. The industry also pays fees to the Railroad Commission of Texas and significant taxes and royalties to the state far in excess of any amounts the agency uses to fund plugging of abandoned wells, Staples said by email. A vibrant energy industry will ensure there are ample resources from operators, not taxpayers, available to manage well assets. With more operators folding and fewer new production permits being issued in Texas, Palacios and fellow environmental activists argue that the Railroad Commission must prepare for an energy market transformation in which oil and gas taxes will not account for as much of the states revenue. Were in the middle of an energy transition, and I think its happening faster than people realize, faster than the commission is willing to acknowledge, Palacios said. We need to restructure the ways that we hold operators accountable for doing what theyre supposed to do. But we also need to think about how to fund the Railroad Commission going forward with a decelerating instead of accelerating oil and gas industry.

52,Varcoe: Energy consolidation escalates as rising oil price eases urgency,edsonleader,"Mar 11, 2021",2021-03-11 00:00:00,"Two different takeover deals are providing insight into how companies  and investors  see M&A activity playing out this year Last Updated 7 hours ago Inter Pipeline's Heartland Petrochemical Complex in Alberta. Photo by Courtesy Inter Pipeline Ltd. / Postmedia file The seismic collapse of oil prices that began one year ago left weakened Canadian energy companies vulnerable to the pressures of consolidation. Will a sharp recovery in prices change that dynamic in 2021? Distroscale Two different takeover deals are providing insight into how companies  and investors  see M&A activity playing out this year. Inter Pipeline Ltd. is trying to fend off a hostile bid from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP and is now looking for a better offer. On Tuesday, the board of the Calgary-based midstream company rejected the unsolicited bid from Brookfield, dismissing the proposal as being opportunistic. Inter Pipeline CEO Chris Bayle said it doesnt reflect the underlying value of the company and the benefit of its Heartland Petrochemical Complex now being built in Strathcona County in Alberta. And he also believes it doesnt reflect the recent rally in energy markets. Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. We dont think that offer factors in at all the considerable strengthening in energy prices and petrochemical prices that have happened from late last year to today, Bayle said in an interview Tuesday. Brookfields bid for Inter Pipeline was launched last monthand offers $16.50 a share for the target company. (Inter Pipeline closed Wednesday at $18.18 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.) Since an initial Brookfield approach to the company in November, the price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) oil has improved dramatically, climbing from around US$40 a barrel to over $60 notes the Inter Pipeline directors circular. At the same time, the price gap between feedstock propane and polypropylene  a plastic that will be produced at the Heartland facility  has risen by about 90 per cent, it states. The companys $4-billion complex is slated to start operating next year. The company has been seeking a partner to acquire a stake in the big-ticket project and Bayle said the timeline of finding one in the first half of this year remains intact. The pandemic affected the companys push to find a partner, but a lot of the dynamic has changed now, he said. There has been a significant improvement, Id call it, in market tone with the strengthening of oil and petrochemical prices, Bayle said. And I think a lot of companies weve been talking to are now considering how best to move forward with the growth mindset  and we think that helps with our discussions. Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Officials with Brookfield declined to comment on Wednesday. Inter Pipeline began a strategic review process last month and Bayle said hes quite confident there will be other parties that have serious interest in Inter Pipeline. Meanwhile, Secure Energy Services Inc. announced Tuesday a friendly $478-million takeoverof Tervita Corp., a move that will create a larger midstream infrastructure and waste management services provider. The all-stock transaction for Tervita also includes the assumption of $866 million in net debt, noted a report by ATB Capital Markets. Waste management services firm Tervita Corp is being bought by Canadas Secure Energy Services Inc. Photo by Ted Rhodes/Calgary Herald/Postmedia The merger is expected to lead to cost savings of $75 million annually within 18 months of the deal closing. Tervita has about 1,200 employees, while Secure has about 950 people. Secure CEO Rene Amirault said preliminary discussions with Tervita began in the middle of last year and both sides could see the industrial logic of putting the two together. Industry dynamics have changed in the past year with higher oil prices and an upswing in business, although Amirault doesnt see the consolidation trend slowing down. We look to our customers, he said Wednesday. You will see more customers on the producers side consolidating. They are far from done. A lot of the things they want, we want. They want more market relevance, a lower cost of capital. We all have to get more efficient here. While higher oil and gas prices may reduce the immediate need for some companies to merge, he noted the sector has to consider what will happen over the next five years and beyond. Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. I dont think anyone wants to be short-sighted and say that oil is going to stay at $60 forever, Amirault added. After the sudden collapse of oil prices a year ago, the Canadian industrywitnessed a series of mergers and acquisitionsas distressed companies looked to find a partner. The value of deal-making climbed to $20 billion last year from $8 billion in 2019, according to Sayer Energy Advisors. So far this year, the upstream Canadian oil and gas sector has seen $6.9 billion of M&A activity compared with $250 million in the first quarter last year, said Sayer Energy president Tom Pavic. The industry has seen conditions improve rapidly this year. Oil prices have jumped 35 per cent since the start of January, with benchmark U.S. prices closing Wednesday at $64.44 a barrel. Although companies are growing stronger, investors expect the takeover trend will continue. Michael Tims, vice-chair of Matco Investments, said there appears to be growing consensus on where commodity prices are headed and transactions are easier to finance in a higher oil-price market. Overall, I am still expecting we will see more M&A activity, Tims said. Its just way smoother to do deals when you have a more positive environment. Eric Nuttall, a senior portfolio manager with Ninepoint Partners, believes the drive for petroleum producers to join forces will continue as companies seek efficiencies and strive to get on the radar screens of more investors. However, the motivation behind some deals in the past year  intense financial pressure squeezing highly leveraged companies  is changing. We are well beyond the valley of death now, Nuttall said. With a $60-plus crude environment plus tight differentials, I have no companies Im worried about at all. Now, consolidation is from a position of strength.

53,Evolve keynote: 'Controlling the narrative key to success in oil and gas,freightwaves,"Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10 23:10:00,"Evolve keynote: Inevitable failures and what we can learn from them. 13 2 minutes read To wrap up a day of panel discussions and rapid-fire demos at Digital Wildcatters and FreightWaves virtual conference, Evolve: The Next Evolution of Oil & Gas, Allen Gilmer and Chuck Yates sat down with a bottle of cabernet to reminisce about lessons learned from the boom-bust cycles of the oil and gas industry  and offer advice for those getting into a business sector that could be on the verge of a new upswing. I think the biggest culprit in all of this were public investors measuring companies on the basis of production growth, said Yates, whose job title is galactic viceroy of Digital Wildcatters. They didnt care about rates of return. And you got addicted to that as a public company. So, am I going to experiment with six wells even though I think 12 wells is the right spacing? No you drilled the 12 wells. We got very comfortable, agreed Gilmer, founder and chairman of Enverus, a software service company dedicated to the energy market. He added that, at the same time, the U.S. was destroying global demand growth. Were meeting all the demand here, and all of a sudden moving into a swing production point of view in a way that scared the hell out of the rest of the world, because it was completely uncontrolled. Gilmer asked Yates for his thoughts on which company or industry had the best chance of effecting decarbonization in a world that is driving hard in that direction. Pointing out first that it is not government regulation thats behind the push to decarbonize but the private sector and its investors, Yates said it was the energy sector itself that is in the best position  particularly the BPs and Exxons of the world. But its a much different story if youre not one of the major players, he said. I wouldnt want to be on the board of a $3-$5 billion oil and gas company trying to figure out that question. Yates asked what their generation should be telling those in their 20s and 30s who are in or are interested in entering the oil and gas industry today. In my career I always knew what was going to happen five to 10 years in the future, Gilmer said, but he found as he got older that your gears get stuck in a certain place. Young people are coming in with a clarity and are not gumming up the gears yet. The cost of being able to manage an oil and gas asset lends itself to divesting to the next level down, and right now if you take a look at the big companies that have been acquiring, theyve announced theres going to be $50 billion worth of divestment coming in the next year. And with regard to pivoting and knowing where the next play is, Ive always been a believer in just doing what youre good at and dont be a victim. Acknowledging that he and Gilmer have made their living in an industry that is not appreciated by many, the single most important thing I would tell 25- to 35-year-olds is control the narrative, Yates said. Because these two old guys sitting here? We havent done it. Tags",https://www.freightwaves.com/news/controlling-the-narrative-key-to-success-in-oil-and-gas-business

63,Challenges And Trends For The Oil And Gas Industry,forbes,"Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10 21:24:53,"There are three primary challenges facing the oil and gas industry today. The first is to produce even more energy at lower cost with less emissions. The global population is increasing and energy demand post covid-19 will not only recover but increase. Oil Giant Bets Big On Expected $2 Trillion Carbon Capture Market So what trends we will see for the next 12 to 24 months? These are very clear. Oil and gas companies will continue to lower costs, lower carbon emissions and lower risk. Lowering cost requires the relentless pursuit of improving efficiencies in every aspect of the value chain. Lowering carbon emissions mandates best in class operational practices as well as continued technology development and deployment. Oil and gas companies can lower technical risk with better reservoir models, better visualization and more. These three trends will likely continue well beyond the next two years. They have become requirements for businesses to thrive and survive in todays energy market. Lastly besides all the hard skills that are needed to meet the challenges outlined here, oil and gas companies will need to continually develop their softer skills. They are communication, collaboration and innovation. In some ways the continued development and successful utilization of soft skills is the hardest part of all yet they are absolutely required for success. The world will be using oil and gas for decades to come. The customer of today and tomorrow will demand not only access to energy but that it is clean, affordable and reliable. The oil and gas industry can meet these challenges and need to do that in partnership with customers, governments and universities. Reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is possible but we all need to do our part. William Bill Maloney is currently on the Board of Directors of Trident Energy and ATX Energy.

(Source: Shutterstock.com) Your browser does not support the audio element. Three Democratic U.S. senators on March 9 floated a bill that would take a new approach to curbing emissions from methane from oil and gas productionputting a price on it. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Cory Booker and Brian Schatz introduced the Methane Emissions Reduction Act, which directs the Department of Treasury to assess a fee on the potent greenhouse gas beginning in 2023a move they say could end those emissions, help achieve climate change targets and improve air quality in communities near oil and gas facilities. The bill also calls on Treasury to work with the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop a program to monitor and measure methane emissions from each major oil-producing basin. This bill will hold oil and gas companies financially responsible for their methane pollution and make methane emissions from fossil fuel production cost prohibitive, steps that will go a long way in the fight against climate change and to protect air quality in local communities, Booker said. National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy said the Biden administration is working to propose new regulations to curb methane emissions on federal and private land by September, replacing and strengthening regulations that the Trump administration had revoked. Special Climate Envoy John Kerry has said the U.S. will work to align methane regulation with other countries, such as Canada. RELATED: Biden Climate Adviser: Trumps Deregulation Efforts Failed The fee the bill envisions would be assessed on a basin-by-basin basis and cover all companies that produce, gather, process, or transmit oil or natural gas, the senators said, and would be based on a formula factoring in the company's gas production and methane rate. Companies that already voluntarily reduce methane will be able to opt out of the fee by demonstrating their emissions intensity is below the average of the operating basin. Funds raised from the fee go into the National Coastal Resilience Fund, a program administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and NOAA to prepare communities for climate change.",https://www.hartenergy.com/exclusives/senators-float-price-methane-curb-us-oil-and-gas-emissions-192853

SCHUMER TEES UP VOTE ON HAALAND: Senate Majority Leader officially teed up a vote yesterday on the nomination of Deb Haaland to be Bidens Interior secretary and vowed she will be confirmed despite Republican attempts at holding her up. Earlier this week, GOP Sens. Steve Daines and Cynthia Lummis had announced they put a hold on Haalands nomination, but she has the votes to be confirmed. MCCONNELL WONT SUPPORT HAALAND OR REGAN: Theyd both report straight to the front lines of the new administrations left-wing war on American energy, McConnell said during remarks on the floor this morning on Haaland and Michael Regan s nominations. The Senate is slated to take up a procedural vote this afternoon on Regans nomination to be EPA administrator. Regans nomination hasnt garnered as fierce GOP opposition as Haalands. Four Republicans on the Senate Environment Committee voted to support Regans nomination. McConnell, however, said Regan is plainly prepared to bring back far-left policies issued during the Obama administration such as regulations similar to the Clean Power Plan and the waters of the U.S. He also slammed Haaland for being an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal and for prior comments vowing to reject further buildout of fossil fuel infrastructure. CHEVRON CEO DEFENDS TIMELINE TO END FLARING: Chevron CEO Mike Wirth yesterday defended the company from environmentalist criticism that the company should be moving up its timeline for eliminating routine flaring, or intentional burning, of excess natural gas, which has become a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Chevron, as part of new emissions targets it set yesterday, said it plans to eliminate flaring by 2030. Thats the same target date set by fellow U.S. oil major ExxonMobil. Ben Ratner , senior director with the Environmental Defense Fund+Business, told Josh that Chevron should be aiming to end flaring by 2025, not 2030. He argues the company missed an opportunity given its status as a top performer when it comes to containing methane emissions from its oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin, outdoing Exxon. Chevrons Wirth told Josh in a press call yesterday that ending flaring at all of its drilling locations is not as simple or straightforward as it might seem. Companies generally resort to flaring when there is insufficient pipeline or other infrastructure to transport the natural gas for use. Flaring primarily emits carbon, but some of the natural gas can escape as methane. We have to create infrastructure and markets to do this, Wirth said. Thats why it takes some time. Wirth, however, said Chevron wont be leaving all the work to the backend of the 2030 deadline. GRANHOLM TOUTS JOB OPPORTUNITIES FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLE BOOM: Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm touted a report released yesterday finding that federal government investments to spur electric vehicle growth, critical minerals mining, and battery manufacturing could create 647,000 jobs over the next five years. Governments have to get in the game or we will be run over, Granholm said during a webinar hosted by Securing Americas Future Energy (SAFE), a group that seeks to reduce reliance on oil that released the report The report found the job creation would spawn from a mix of policies, including stronger fuel efficiency standards, grants to manufacturing plants building clean energy technologies, tax subsidies for purchasing EVS, investing in stations to charge them, and R&D funding for next generation transportation technologies. Granholm suggested she was on board with all of those policies, pledging DOE would invest billions in the next few years on technologies to make an electric vehicle future a reality. We have a huge sense of urgency on getting these solutions out the door, she said. Our hair is on fire. How to grow EV use : Granholm said DOE would strive to help reduce the cost of batteries to less than $80 per kilowatt hour, a price point that would enable buying an electric car to be cost competitive with gasoline-powered ones. She also said the U.S. needs to boost domestic production of critical minerals used to make EVs to reduce reliance on China, and suggested coal miners could transition to mining electric car metals. I hope we can see bipartisan support for this, Granholm said. This energy security issue is a national security issue. We are seeing the economic challenges from competitors like weve never seen before. LEASING FREEZE WONT STOP PRODUCTION: Bidens pause on oil and gas leasing wont affect production this year, the Energy Information Administration projected yesterday. No effects will likely occur until 2022 because there is roughly a minimum eight-to-ten month delay from leasing to production in onshore areas and longer in offshore areas, EIA wrote in its Short-Term Energy Outlook. Even then, the reductions would be minimal, with U.S. crude oil production expected to fall by less than 100,000 barrels per day on average in 2022. Emissions to rise: After a record fall last year due to the pandemic, carbon emissions will rise almost 6% this year, as increased economic activity leads to more energy use, EIA said. Coal-related emissions are set to increase by 14% in 2021, as a result of more coal use in power generation because of higher natural gas prices. US OIL DEMAND DOWN, STOCKS UP: U.S. oil demand fell last week to 18.67 million barrels per day from 18.76 million barrels p/d the week prior, the EIA reported today. Jet fuel demand took a big fall, offsetting increases in gasoline and diesel consumption. Crude inventories swelled for the second consecutive week after the Texas deep freeze, rising by 13.8 million barrels. That comes after a record increase of 21.6 million barrels last week, the largest weekly crude build since data became available in 1982, as refineries with power outages could not process the crude, leaving nowhere for it to go. Draws in gasoline stocks, however, are offsetting the crude builds. Oil prices havent moved much this morning.

Oil and gas support for Xochitl Torres Small exposes internal divisions Bryan Metzger New Mexico In Depth This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth Dressed in denim on a windy day in front of an oil and gas rig, Xochitl Torres Small looks into the camera and says, Washington doesnt get us, then tells viewers she fought to get workers the coronavirus relief they deserve. The ad is just one of many in which Democrat Torres Small is positioning herself as an ally of oil and gas this election yearas she strives to win a second term in New Mexicos southern congressional district, one of just 26 of 435 House races across the nation declared a tossup by the respected Cook Political Report. Its New Mexicos most competitive high-profile contest. Two years after Torres Small beat former Republican state lawmaker Yvette Herrell by fewer than 4,000 votes out of nearly 200,000 cast, the two women are facing off again in 2020, and Torres Small is making sure to stress her oil and gas bona fides. ELECTION 2020: Xochitl Torres Small and Yvette Herrell headed for rematch Oil and gas money powers the economy in the 2nd Congressional District and generations of families have come up through the oil patch in a solidly Republican swath of counties in southeast New Mexico. The first-term Democrat insists she would not vote to ban fracking, a drilling method that has greatly expanded U.S. fossil fuel production and flooded New Mexico with revenue before the pandemic crippled the state economy. Advocates who want to ban the procedure, which injects chemical-laden water at high pressure into underground rock formations, say fracking threatens human health in addition to increasing greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels. But industry professionals and their supporters insist it can be done safely and responsibly. Torres Small also took to Twitter last week to call out her partys presidential nominee, tweeting it was wrong to demonize one industry in the fight against climate change after Joe Biden said hed work to transition to an economy based on renewable energy and away from the current oil economy. Her efforts to trumpet her support of oil and gas come at a time when the industry itself is in turmoil and internal tensions between larger companies and their smaller New Mexico-based counterparts are bursting into the open, particularly over how to talk about Torres Small and her record. Ryan Flynn, executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, whose board of directors is dominated by out-of-state oil producers, told the Associated Press in August that Torres Small has been a strong advocate for our states energy interests. MORE: Torres Small, Herrell discuss oil sector, border security in second debate Flynns comment ignited a mini-firestorm among Republican loyalists. New Mexico Republican Party Chairman Steve Pearce, a former congressman in the southern district who made a fortune selling his oil field services company, condemned Flynns statement. In an op-ed for New Mexico newspapers he and the Legislatures top two GOP lawmakers  House Minority Leader Jim Townsend, R-Artesia, and Senate Minority Leader Stuart Ingle, R-Portales  called on the NMOGA Board of Directors to replace Flynn. Flynn was turning the group into a highly charged political organization that worked on behalf of large oil producers rather than smaller New Mexico based companies, they wrote. A separate letter to the NMOGA Board  spearheaded by Mark Murphy, President of Strata Production Company and signed by 12 other New Mexico oil producers went a step further, saying Flynns comments represented an attempt to sabotage Herrells candidacy and fundraising efforts and demanded the board replace Flynn. The NMOGA Board would stand by Flynn, issuing a statement of support that included a commitment to continue to work with federal, state and local leaders, regardless of their political affiliation. As for Torres Small, Flynn doesnt back down. She has been a strong advocate of our industrys interests and I stand by the statement, he told New Mexico In Depth. Navigating a challenging environment In October 2017, Ryan Flynn took the podium at NMOGAs 89th Annual Meeting, addressing a crowd at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Declaring that NMOGA was going to become the most powerful organization in the state again, Flynn noted after seven years of not having to worry about regulation from Republican Governor Susana Martinezs administration, an election was looming. He outlined a strategy centeredaround aggressive public engagement, combating anti-industry rhetoric, and a strong commitment to bipartisanship. We cannot tie ourselves to a single political party, Flynn said at the time. We have too much at stake to allow ourselves to be shifting back and forth when the states political landscape changes. Since then, with Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham taking over from Martinez in 2019, Flynn has continued to say the industry needs to heed the concerns of constituencies whose goals dont fit comfortably with the Republican partys base. MORE: Bidens warning on oil tests voter resolve on climate change This summer, according to audio leaked and reported by the New York Times he is heard cautioning a group of oil industry lobbyists that environmental stewardship is top of mind for young, female, Hispanic voters, the same demographic as Xochitl Torres Small. In a follow-up interview with the Times, Flynn said addressing concerns about climate change is critical to the industrys future. Flynn has backed his words with action. In December 2019, NMOGA made a $25,000 direct donation to the leadership fund of Democratic House Speaker Brian Egolf  a decision that angered some producers enough to warrant mention in Murphys August 10 letter demanding Flynns termination. The authors said this money then gets funneled into the campaigns of other far-left candidates who are unfriendly to oil and gas. Asked about these contributions, Flynn explained they were part of NMOGAs nonpartisan approach. We engage with government in New Mexico, he told New Mexico In Depth. And so were going to engage with Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Green Party candidates. If youre a policymaker in New Mexico, and you want to engage on issues impacting the oil and gas industry, then we want to talk to you. Bi-partisanship or appeasement? His critics equate Flynns approach to short-sighted appeasement. I think its very important for NMOGA, or Independent Petroleum Association, or whomever to attempt to get along, to offer rational suggestions, said Harvey Yates, President of the Jalapeno Corporation and former state GOP party chairman. But that doesnt mean that you attempt to buy goodwill by [making] donations and so forth. Yates, a member of the Yates oil family, signed Murphys letter demanding Flynn be replaced.

View Comments Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholms confirmation as the U.S. Secretary of Energy could have significant implication for New Mexico  a major oil- and gas-producing state and home to two national laboratories and the nations only nuclear waste repository. Both New Mexicos fossil fuel and nuclear industries fall under the purview of the Department of Energy, which Granholm will lead as the administration of President Joe Biden seeks to advance its climate change agenda focused on mitigating pollution and reducing the impacts of extraction across the U.S. U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) voted to confirm Granholm but urged the former governor to learn about the needs of New Mexico and its unique contributions to Americas energy sectors. More: 'Radical' or bipartisan? Haaland's Interior Secretary hearing a debate on oil and gas Heinrich recently sent a letter to Granholm inviting her to visit New Mexico, learn about the fossil fuel industry and its workers and tour Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories to get a better feel for New Mexicos position as a national energy leader. Granholm, a longtime supporter of renewable energy and the electrification of the automobiles, was a controversial choice to head up the DOE as oil and gas leaders feared she would not support their industry, but environmentalists were eager for action on climate change. In his letter, Heinrich pointed to the thousands of New Mexicans employed by oil and gas and called on Granholm support fossil fuel workers who would be laid off as the nation shifts to renewables like wind and solar. More: Key energy takeaways from Deb Haaland's confirmation hearing for Interior Secretary The energy sector is changing rapidly, which means exciting new careers for hundreds of thousands of Americans, but it also means many job losses or changes in traditional fossil energy, Heinrich said. I know you agree there is a need for federal investments to ensure that oil and gas workers and their communities are not left behind. The people who work in these sectors are our energy veterans, men and women who have powered this great nation for the last half century and given their working lives to that goal. During Granholms confirmation hearings, Heinrich said he was able to secure a commitment from the secretary that her energy policy for the U.S. would entail state-specific strategies considering the differing needs of states like New Mexico heavily embroiled in energy development and reliant on the industry for much of its economy. More: New Mexico regulators tangle over oil and gas pipeline authority via Senate bill Oil and gas was credited with more than a third of the states economy last year, and more than half of that production occurs on federal lands subject to federal policy Granholm would lead. I appreciate your commitment to work with me to create a place-based energy transition plan that ensures hard-working New Mexicans are not left behind, he said. Your early visit to New Mexico will be an opportunity to begin the process of assessing our states economic assets and developing a comprehensive strategy to retrain individuals to be prepared for new careers in their communities. More: Aside from energy production, Heinrich also argued Granholm must understand the importance of New Mexico national laboratories, where nuclear research and development is conducted for the nation. He said both Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories were essential to national security. The work at Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories is critical to meeting the U.S. Department of Energys mission of assuring national security through stewardship of the nuclear weapons stockpile, nuclear non-proliferation and homeland security, Heinrich wrote. More: Lujan Grisham joins state leaders voicing concerns for Biden's halt on oil and gas leases U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM) who also voted to confirm Granholm, argued New Mexico was critical to the DOEs missions in developing less-polluting forms of energy and continuing nuclear research and defense efforts during Granholms tenure. New Mexicans need a Secretary of Energy who will accelerate a clean energy transition, champion our National Labs research and development efforts, invest in New Mexicos workforce, support tech transfer to give our companies a competitive advantage, and create opportunities for the people of our state, Lujan said But New Mexico oil and gas industry trade groups worried Granholms position to lead the DOE signaled an approach to energy that could deny the contributions of fossil fuels and lead to the industrys disruption. More: Ozone problems continue to plague New Mexico. Enviros seek federal action, blame oil and gas Daniel Turner, executive director at Power the Future, an oil and gas advocacy operational in New Mexico, said Granholms nomination and ultimate confirmation was a sign that the Biden administration planned to embrace a radical, eco-left agenda that could spell economic ruin for places like New Mexico. Americans cant afford a radical strategy at the national level, he said. If Jennifer Granholm governors the Energy Department the same way she governed Michigan, it may just cost us hundreds of billions of dollars, millions of jobs, and the energy independence that President Trump fought so hard to achieve. The American Petroleum Institute voiced support for Granholm following her confirmation but called on the secretary to work with the industry in developing market-driven solutions to climate change and pollution as opposed to restrictive federal regulations. ""The departments early focus on research and development is encouraging, and we are committed to partnering with Secretary Granholm to further advance innovation as well as the modern infrastructure thats needed to safely and responsibly deliver American energy across the country and around the world,"" read a statement from the Institute.

70,Report: Oil and gas leads New Mexico in greenhouse gas emissions,currentargus,"Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10 08:46:00,"Oil and gas generated 60 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2018, about four times more than previously estimated, per the report. View Comments State efforts to reduce the impact of climate change in New Mexico took the form of three major initiatives: cutting emissions from oil and gas operations, pushing more renewable energy and updating regulations such as building codes and vehicle standards to be more environmentally sound. On Friday, New Mexicos Climate Change Task Force released its annual report, updating progress on the states climate change efforts and the Task Forces recommendations on how to meet New Mexicos goals. The Task Force, made up of the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) and the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD), was formed in January 2019 by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham via executive order as she assumed office. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. Lujan Grisham said ecological concerns such as lengthening fire seasons and drought showed that the state must continue its focus on policy aimed at reducing the causes of climate change, and that work continued even amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In many ways, our commitment to fighting climate change is only stronger, as we have seen the stark effects of a changing climate laid bare with an extended fire season, extreme drought conditions and low water levels, Lujan Grisham said. We are dead set against allowing climate change to bring about the next public health crisis. EMNRD Cabinet Secretary Sarah Cottrell Propst said that while the state made progress on climate change in the last year, it would continue its efforts in diversifying the states economy away from its reliance on fossil fuels and grow New Mexicos renewable energy sector. More: Oil and gas industry, New Mexico works to curb greenhouse gas emissions, fight climate change In a short amount of time, New Mexico has taken meaningful steps to address the climate crisis, diversify our economy, and expand renewable energy, Propst said. This report chronicles the work accomplished so far, but also holds us accountable for the significant work left to do. James Kenney, NMED cabinet secretary said the Task Forces achievements were led by partnerships between the government and private industry. The public and private sectors are proudly leading climate mitigation efforts  building hope for the future, said James Kenney, Cabinet Secretary of the Environment Department. We are absolutely dedicated to continuing this critical work outlined in this report as quickly as possible. More: Oil and gas industry, environmentalists voice criticism of New Mexico's methane rules Fossil fuel development remained the highest generator of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) in New Mexico, the report read, representing 53 percent of the states GHG emissions followed by transportation at 14 percent and electricity generation at 11 percent. The state cited a recent study from Colorado State University this year that provided the best estimates to date of recent and future emissions from New Mexico-specific sources. The CSU report showed oil and gas generated 60 million metric tons of GHGs in 2018, about four times more than previously estimated. More: Federal oil and gas leases in New Mexico attacked despite billions in revenue Among all sectors, the state generated about 113.6 million metric tons of GHGs, about 1.8 percent of the U.S. total emissions. That meant New Mexico produced more than 50 tons per person per year of GHGs, the report read, more than twice the national average per capita. Nationally, oil and gas generated about 31 percent of GHGs, read the report. Air pollution could be curbed by New Mexicos growing renewable energy sector, the report read. More: Study: New oil and gas drilling techniques could increase radiation levels nearby That Task Force reported about 1,346 megawatts of renewables  enough to power more than 300,000 homes  was expected to come online by the end of 2020. Since the Energy Transition Act was passed last year, which called for New Mexico to shift to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2024, the state saw 11 renewable energy project come online, the report read, for a total capacity of 268 MW. By the end of the year, there will be 15 new projects brought into operations. More: Major Permian Basin oil and gas companies merge to survive coronavirus pandemic To deliver renewable energy to customers across the state, the report called on New Mexico to increase its transmission infrastructure for renewable energy. Increasing transmission lines by 900 to 1,300 miles could led to developing another 11,500 MW by 2032 and would allow New Mexico to reach its goal of 50 percent renewable energy by 2030. New Mexico currently has about 9,300 miles of transmission lines. The report advocated for both large, utility scale installations of wind and solar, and smaller community installations like solar panels on homes and businesses. More: New Mexico eyeing stricter regulations, more fines on oil and gas spills Development of renewable energy project both large and small was bolstered, the report read, thanks to legislation passed during New Mexicos recent 2020 Legislative Session. Senate Bill 29 established a solar market development income tax credit that allows taxpayers to gain up to $6,000 in income tax credits per year for solar, thermal and photovoltaic power systems, with EMNRD receiving about 150 applications in the first two months of the program, the report read. Senate Memorial 63 established a community solar working group to develop strategies for a community solar program in New Mexico that would allow multiple users to benefit from small-scale solar panel installations. New Mexicos revamped regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas, which are under public review, were intended to see operators capture 98 percent of emissions by 2026. More: New Mexico's oil and gas collapse could last years amid calls for economic diversification Jon Goldstein, director of regulatory and legislative affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund said New Mexico must enact stricter pollution restrictions to meet its climate change goals, and that the Task Forces report showed that more work must be done. Governor Lujan Grisham has taken strong action on climate change, but comprehensive, economy-wide action will still be needed to provide the greatest possible certainty the state meets its climate goals and to protect New Mexicans from the worst impacts of a warmer, drier world, Goldstein said. This report also underlines the need for New Mexicos regulators to do more to close loopholes in their draft methane rules given that oil and gas emissions are the largest source of climate pollution in the state. If the loopholes are not addressed, Gov Lujan Grishams administration will fall short of their ambitious and needed targets.

71,"New Mexico eyeing stricter regulations, more fines on oil and gas spills",currentargus,"Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10 08:11:00,"This year, as of Oct. 26 the OCD reported 573 produced water releases and 297 crude oil spills, per state records. View Comments State oil and gas regulators are considering stricter regulations that could bring automatic fines against operators that report spills of substances associated with extraction such as crude oil or produced. WildEarth Guardians filed a petition earlier this month with the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resource Departments Oil Conservation Division (OCD), the States main compliance arm for oil and gas activities. The petition called for the Oil Conservation Commission to take up the proposed rulemaking at its Nov. 4 meeting where commissioners could set a future hearing to vote on codifying the proposed rules into law. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. In its application for rulemaking, the group argued that spills and releases of waste from the oilfield such as natural gas, crude, produced water and other contaminants were not expressly outlawed by New Mexico state law. The initial petition only added requirement for produced water and the Commission agreed to a hearing in April 2021, but WildEarth Guardians recently expanded their petition to included all forms of oilfield waste and another hearing must be set. Produced water is a combination of water that flows back to the surface during the hydraulic fracturing process and formation water brought to the surface from underground rock formations that contain oil and natural gas. More: New Mexico's oil and gas collapse could last years amid calls for economic diversification Produced water is traditionally pumped back underground, but many companies have opted in recent years to treat the water and reuse it for future fracking operations. Under current regulations, operators must report a spill or release to the regulator and then take subsequent steps to remediate the release and the impacted environment and take steps to prevent future incidents to avoid fines. The proposed rule would fill that glaring regulatory hole by specifically prohibiting major or minor releases, as those terms are already defined in the Commissions rules, read the application. More: Study: New oil and gas drilling techniques could increase radiation levels nearby WildEarth Guardians cited the environmental impacts of routine releases of substances associated with extraction, pointing to 15,811 such incidents reported by the OCD since 2010  about 7,102 releases of produced water and 4,203 releases of crude oil. This year, as of Oct. 26 the OCD reported 573 produced water releases and 297 crude oil spills, per state records. While the operators are required to remediate the environment and work to recover as much of the spilled resource as possible, WildEarth Guardians pointed thousands of gallons of oil and produced water reported as lost by the OCD. The group argued this meant operators were not required to fully remediated spills by state regulators. More: Study shows billions of government relief dollars to oil and gas amid COVID-19 While OCCs rules require reporting and cleanup of both major and minor releases, the Commissions cleanup standards fail to ensure that the operators responsible for spills fully remediate the environmental damage caused by toxic pollution, the application read. In fact, OCD records show significant quantities of oil and gas and related toxic waste products lost into the environment after accidental releases. The changes proposed by WildEarth Guardians would add additional reporting requirements for spills, while also prohibiting them and calling for notices of violations upon reporting of a spills or requiring civil action and imposing penalties on operators. More: New Mexico releases new oil and gas emissions rules, calls for hearing to put into law Daniel Timmons, staff attorney with the WildEarth Guardians said stricter regulations must be enacted by the State to properly protect the environment from the impacts of extraction. If New Mexico is serious about protecting public health and the environment from the oil and gas industrys toxic waste, then regulators need to ensure that irresponsible, careless, and unsafe handling is no longer tolerated, Timmons said. While the New Mexico Oil Conservation Commission claims to want to protect people from the oil and gas industrys waste, its disturbing that spills remain legal and rampant. Bill Brancard, EMNRD general council said expanding the agency recommended scope of the petition be expanded to include not only produced water, but other forms of extractive waste. More: Oil and gas wastewater investments continue in Permian Basin, group calls for stricter rules They trying to directly attach new penalty provisions, he said. They want to attach spills so that if you report a spill you might also have to pay fines. Their logic is that if they (operators) incur fines, that could reduce spills. Brancard said companies are already required to report spills or releases and clean them up and incur the associated costs. He said the State was largely unspecific about how companies clean up a spill, and stricter regulations could benefit the process. More: New Mexico investigating possible drilling mud spill at Higby Hole near Malaga We require that they clean it up, but we arent very specific about how you have to clean it up, Brancard said. It can be very costly if you have a spill to clean up. EMNRD relies on operators to report spills, Brancard said, with thousands of wells throughout New Mexico and few inspectors available. More fines imposed on the companies reporting the spills, he said, could lead to less reports as operators attempt to avoid such fines. Thats the debate that will occur before the Commission, Brancard said. Having 60,000 wells out there and not a lot of inspectors makes it hard for us to report spills. We rely on operator reporting. The argument could be made that if they have these fines added, they might not report a lot. More: Before COVID-19, oil and gas' drove economy in New Mexico, struggles to continue in 2021 Less operator reporting could mean more resources expended by already cash-strapped state regulators, Brancard said, and could delay the clean-up process. He said spills and accidental releases are bound to happen, and the important thing is to make sure they are adequately remediated by those responsible. Theres inevitably going to be spills and accidents, Brancard said. We really want to get companies out there and clean it up. The quicker its cleaned up, the less risk to the environment.

72,US officials: report on oil and gas sale ban due by summer,midfloridanewspapers,"Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10 08:00:00,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP)  The Biden administration said Tuesday that it will deliver an interim report on its suspension of oil and gas sales from federal lands and waters by Save BILLINGS, Mont. (AP)  The Biden administration said Tuesday that it will deliver an interim report on its suspension of oil and gas sales from federal lands and waters by summer, but officials declined to state how long the moratorium could remain in place. A long-term ban on lease sales from the nation's vast, publicly-owned oil and gas reserves to address climate change would fulfill a campaign pledge from Democratic President Joe Biden. The prospect has rankled Republicans and petroleum industry representatives, who have said that Biden is putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk as the economy reels from the pandemic. Oil and gas from federal reserves in western states and the Gulf of Mexico make up about a quarter of U.S. production. Lease sales to companies for drilling have been a frequent target of lawsuits from environmentalists who contend officials have ignored the oil and gas program's climate impact. Biden announced a temporary suspension of new sales one week after he took office. Tuesday's announcement offered the first details of a review of the Interior Department program that officials said will examine climate issues and whether taxpayers are getting a fair return on sales of energy leases to private companies. Last month, the administration postponed lease sales in the Gulf and four states  Colorado, Montana, Utah and Wyoming. ""The federal oil and gas program is not serving the American public well,"" Interior Department Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis said in a statement. ""It's time to take a close look at how to best manage our nation's natural resources with current and future generations in mind."" The administration has pledged to spend billions to assist in the transition away from fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. Biden has said creating clean-energy jobs is a top priority. There is no estimate on how long the review could take, agency spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said. Even a short-lived suspension on leasing will quickly affect companies, tying their hands as they seek to make drilling plans for coming years, said Erik Milito of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents oil companies operating offshore. ""We will begin seeing companies starting to make decisions that will shift investments and jobs out of the U.S.."" Milito said. The longer a suspension goes, he added, the more susceptible the administration will be to legal challenge. Democrats, environmentalists and left-leaning policy groups said the leasing program has remained unchanged for decades and needed to be reformed in the face of climate change. ""The oil and gas leasing program is broken, plain and simple,"" said Jenny Rowland with the Center for American Progress, a liberal, Washington-based policy group that has been supportive of Biden's agenda. The Interior Department said it will host a livestreamed forum on the leasing program on March 25 to get input from industry representatives, labor and environmental justice groups and natural resource advocates. A report outlining initial findings and the next steps in the review will be completed by early summer, officials said.",https://www.midfloridanewspapers.com/highlands_news-sun/us-officials-report-on-oil-and-gas-sale-ban-due-by-summer/article_75572870-810e-11eb-ad29-cf2b853faab5.html

Alberta gives inquiry into oil and gas critics another extension to complete report Back to video Late Friday, the United Conservative government released an order-in-council amending the inquirys deadline to May 31. Cabinet has granted the commissioners request for an extension to ensure he is able to complete a comprehensive investigation into a possible well-funded foreign campaign aimed at discrediting the provinces energy sector, Peter Brodsky, press secretary for Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage, wrote in an email. Cabinet allowed the extension to ensure that potential participants have a fair opportunity to provide input. Brodksy said no additional funds will be provided to complete the inquiry. Premier Jason Kenney and his government contend that foreign interests have long been bankrolling campaigns against Canadian fossil fuel development. Allan, a forensic accountant, was tapped in 2019 to lead the public inquiry with an initial budget of $2.5 million and a July 2020 deadline. Last summer, Allan was given a four-month extension and a $1-million budget increase. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content In October, the inquiry got another 90-day extension, but no new money. Savage must publish the final report within 90 days of receiving it. Earlier Friday, the Opposition NDP called on the government to immediately release the results of the overdue, over-budget, scandal-tainted, not-so-public inquiry once its received. Albertans have waited long enough to hear back from this kangaroo court, energy critic Kathleen Ganley said in a statement. She noted that thousands of energy sector workers are without a job, projects have been cancelled, investment has fled and new U.S. President Joe Biden has cancelled the Alberta-to-Texas Keystone XL oil pipeline expansion. Environmental law group Ecojustice filed a lawsuit in November 2019 that alleged the inquiry was politically motivated, biased and outside provincial jurisdiction. Late last year, Ecojustice lost a court bid to have Allans work paused until there was a ruling in the lawsuit. Eleven groups and individuals were granted standing to be a participant for commentary before the inquiry, but their identities are not being disclosed. Participants were provided reading material, including links to reports commissioned by the inquiry that contained passages denying or downplaying the broad scientific consensus around human-caused climate change. Those materials no longer appear to be on the website. One commissioned report, by University of Calgary political scientist Barry Cooper, argued that philanthropic foundations have been captured by ideological environmental activists. It mentioned growing scientific skepticism regarding the so-called consensus view regarding anthropogenic climate change and apocalyptic and alarmist rhetoric around the issue. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Another report the inquiry requested from T.L. Nemeth contended there was a transnational global movement afoot to replace the current capitalist world order with a new global low-carbon, net-zero civilization. In it, the author suggested climate change is not due to human activity, but natural phenomena, and that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, but a gas essential to all life on Earth.

74,BLM planning to sell more New Mexico land to oil and gas in 2021,currentargus,"Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10 01:25:00,"Sales of public land in New Mexico to oil and gas were planned by the BLM for January, April, July and October 2021. View Comments Publicly owned land in southeast New Mexico and West Texas was to be auctioned off to the oil and gas industry by the federal Bureau of Land Management. The BLM announced its scheduled Jan. 14, 2021 lease sale Wednesday, planning to offer 6,442 acres of public land on 33 parcels in Eddy and Lea counties in New Mexico and Wise County, Texas. A protest period for sale was also scheduled to receive objections to the sale between Nov. 9 and Nov. 19. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. Other lease sales next year were planned by the BLM for April, July and October 2021. Revenue from production on the lands would be used to fund the U.S. Treasury directly, along with the budgets of states where production occurs, read a BLM news release. States get 48 percent of the revenue from the sale and half of the funds generated by production, the release read, with the rest going to the U.S. Treasury. More: Documentation for the sale can be found on the BLMs website and at the agencys state office at 301 Dinosaur Trail in Santa Fe. Protests may be filed at the office in person or via email to BLMNMJan2021Protest@blm.gov The BLM is a key contributor to the Trump Administration's America-First Energy Plan, an all-of-the-above strategy that includes oil and gas, coal, strategic minerals, and renewable sources such as wind, geothermal, and solar  all of which can be produced on public lands, read a statement from the BLM. More: Records show about 720 acres or 11 percent of the land offered in the sale was in Eddy County, while 5,223 acres or 81 percent of the land was offered in Lea County. A single, 500-acre parcel was offered in Wise County, Texas  about 8 percent of the sale. Through an environmental analysis (EA) the BLM found no significant impact on the environment surrounding the lands being offered for oil and gas development. More: New Mexico eyeing stricter regulations, more fines on oil and gas spills The BLM estimated the leases in Eddy and Lea counties would result in 32 horizontal wells and 144 acres of surface disturbance and about 5.4 million barrels of oil produced along with about 31.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The EA noted that extensive oil and gas development already exists in the area contributing to its local economy. Within these counties, as well as the area immediately surrounding the nominated lease parcels, there already exists extensive oil and gas development and production, read the report. Oil and gas development and its attendant industry are identifying components of the economic and social fabric of the region. Leasing for oil and gas, and subsequent exploration and development, is a regular and ongoing activity in the region. More: Oil and gas group gives failing grades to New Mexico Democrat candidates for Congress Will oil and gas leasing contribute to climate change? Environmental groups recently sought to block any new oil and gas leasing of public land in southeastern New Mexico, as the region grappled with some of the highest ozone levels in the state. The federal National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 70 parts per billion (ppb) was exceeded based on state air monitoring in the Carlsbad area with a level of 79 ppb  the highest in the state. Thirteen areas throughout the state were reportedly above or within 95 percent of the NAAQS, which triggered actions by the New Mexico Environment Department(NMED) to reduce ozone levels and avoid being deemed a non-attainment zone by the Environmental Protection Agency which could trigger added federal restrictions on land uses such as oil and gas that could contribute to air pollution. More: New Mexico's oil and gas collapse could last years amid calls for economic diversification But the EPA had yet to officially deem the Carlsbad area or others as non-attainment. The federal designations were required under the Clean Air Act, and involve data evaluation from air quality monitors, modeling results and other technical information. Areas are classified as marginal, moderate, serious, severe or extreme. Sources that are not within the states control such as blow over from other states or bordering countries are considered, said Maddy Hayden, NMED public information officer. More: Study: New oil and gas drilling techniques could increase radiation levels nearby Status is determined by three-year averages calculated using ozone levels from the three most recent consecutive years of monitoring. NMED contracted with the Western States Air Resources Council and Ramboll US Corporation to conduct a petrochemical modeling study for the state Ozone Attainment Initiative. The study was intended to identify sources of heightened ozone levels, focusing on oil and gas regions in the southeast and northwest corners of the state. In September testimony before New Mexicos Environmental Improvement Board attorney for WildEarth Guardians Daniel Timmons said NMEDs continued issuance of oil and gas permits was a major threat to air quality in New Mexico. At core, theres no dispute that ozone pollution is a serious problem and public health threat in southeastern New Mexico, and the Departments continued issuance of new permits and registrations is making this problem worse, Timmons said.

77,House energy committee OKs bill changing how oil and gas wells would be valued for property taxes,wvgazettemail,"Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10 00:30:00,"The state House Energy and Manufacturing Committee approved referring a bill to the House Finance Committee Tuesday that would change how the State Tax Department values producing oil and gas Save The state House Energy and Manufacturing Committee approved referring a bill to the House Finance Committee Tuesday that would change how the State Tax Department values producing oil and gas wells for property tax purposes and the appeals process for all property taxes in the state. This would provide a more expansive definition of operating expenses for gas and oil producers in another industry-friendly move by the committee. House Bill 2581 s provisions include allowing expenses from lifting, processing, transportation and other industry activities to be subtracted from wells income and require the tax department to resurvey well expenses every three years unless natural gas contracts or the average oil price traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange changes more than 20% from the last year a survey was completed, meaning state administrative costs would increase in unstable markets. The bill would expand the jurisdiction of the Office of Tax Appeals to include property tax valuation, classification and taxability, allow petitioners to appeal to a county Board of Equalization and Review or the Office of Tax Appeals and eliminate the Board of Assessment Appeals. Its a fairly complicated statute, but right now youve got two chances at the county level, so youre making the same argument to the same body a few months apart wanting a different result, and if you dont get the result under the current system, you go to the circuit court, committee counsel Robert Akers said. So the new system will take you through the Office of Tax Appeals on the way to circuit court. Attorney Marc Monteleone, a former president of the Independent Oil & Gas Association of West Virginia, said a review found county commissions had rejected each and every one of several hundred appeals in recent years. The county commission doesnt do this assessment, the tax department does, and when you go to the county commission to appeal, they say go to the tax department, we wash our hands of this, Monteleone said.   So by going to the Office of Tax Appeals, were actually shortcutting the system and going to a more productive, more efficient way to appeal. State Tax Department attorney Steve Stockton said the bill adds another layer to the tax appeal process but doesnt necessarily make it more complicated. So more government? Delegate Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, asked Stockton. You could look at it that way, yes, Stockton replied. A fiscal note from the Office of Tax Appeals accompanying the bill estimates it would significantly increase the caseload at the office and envisions the hiring of two more administrative law judges to add to the current two, two staff attorneys and four additional support staff, an increase in staff that the offices current leased space would not support. The fiscal note, which did not factor in estimated cost of leasing larger office space, estimates the other additional expenses would cost an annual $425,000 to $475,000. The bill is similar to last sessions Senate Bill 655 which stalled in the House Finance Committee after passing through the Senate, a measure Monteleone said he worked on. Prompting the proposed reform is a 2019 state Supreme Court decision that Akers explained threw out a cap on deductions in a wells valuation for well operating expenses. That decision triggered concerns that local governments could lose millions in property tax revenues. Delegate Dave Pethtel, D-Wetzel, voiced opposition to the bill. Bottom line, although the oil and gas industry says, Well, this is for a fair review, the bottom line, theyre going to end up paying less money, Pethtel said. If you live in or represent a county that has a lot of gas well drilling, especially Marcellus shale, believe me, this bills going to hurt you. Asked by Pethtel if there was information on how much the bill would cost counties under the bill, Akers said that the committee asked for a fiscal note that had not yet been provided. Im sure by the time this thing gets through Finance, we will have those numbers, Pethtel said. Committee Chairperson Bill Anderson, R-Wood, said he would seek to get that information if its available prior to the Finance Committee considering the bill, whose lead sponsor is Delegate Dianna Graves, R-Kanawha, and has 10 other sponsors, all Republicans. Delegate Mark Zatezalo, R-Hancock, said the bill would create a fairer tax appeal process for the oil and gas industry and touted the importance of West Virginia producing its own energy.

On the news front, Chevron CVXand TC Energy TRPannounced deals to fully own their pipeline units, while ExxonMobil XOMunveiled its five-year plan. Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 7.5% to close at $66.09 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 2.5% in the week to end at $2.701 per million Btu (MMBtu). The U.S. crude benchmark rallied to a 23-month high after major oil producers maintained their output cuts till the end of April contrary to expectations of a slight increase. The OPEC+ alliance will continue withholding production by around 7 million barrels per day (or about 7% of the global consumption) through next month. Moreover, OPEC-kingpin Saudi Arabia pledged to extend its voluntary supply curbs of 1 million barrels per day. Meanwhile, natural gas finished lower following a smaller-than-expected withdrawal from storage and the prospect of less heating consumption due to a mild weather outlook in March. Recap of the Weeks Most-Important Stories 1.  Chevron entered an agreement with Noble Midstream Partners LP NBLXto obtain the latters remaining outstanding assets in an all-stock deal. The contract was announced within six months after Chevron acquired Noble Energy, the parent organization of the master limited partnership (MLP), in one of the biggest deals in the oil industry last year. Chevron is the majority shareholder, with about 63% equitable interest, and the largest customer of Noble Midstream. Notably, the pipeline operator provides crude oil and natural gas, and offers several midstream services to Chevron in the DJ Basin of Colorado as well as Texas's Delaware Basin. Chevron proposed to acquire the remaining 33.925 million publicly held common units in a $1.32-billion deal. The transaction is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of 2021 and is subject to customary approvals. ( Chevron to Purchase All Outstanding Shares in Noble Midstream ) 2.  TC Energy was granted approval for the previously announced acquisition of TC PipeLines, LP from the latters unitholders in a $1.68-billion all-stock deal. Per the agreement, a fully owned subsidiary of TC Energy acquired all the outstanding common units of TC PipeLines not beneficially owned by itself or its affiliates in return for TC Energy common shares. Notably, the transaction was effective on Mar 3. Earlier, TC Energy put in a $1.48-billion offer to acquire the outstanding shares of TC PipeLines, which TC Energy did not already own, in an effort to put the MLP fully under the authority of TC Energy. In December, it raised its offer to $1.68 billion due to investors' allegations that the offer, which was already an increase from the previous bid, was insufficient. However, TC Energy mentioned that it would not lift the bid price any further than it already had. Following the deal completion, TC Energy now fully owns TC PipeLines and the latter is no longer a publicly-held master limited partnership. 3.  ExxonMobil recently announced a long-term production outlook, with an intention of boosting profits and cash flows. Long-term plans are expected to enable the company to increase dividend payments and reduce debt. It is also planning to commercialize low-emission technologies through carbon capture and storage, which highlights the companys efforts to abide by the Paris Agreement goals. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company estimates 2021 capital budget in the range of $16-$19 billion, which indicates a decline from the 2020 level of $21.4 billion, reflecting a disciplined approach. Notably, capital spending is expected in the range of $20-$25 billion per annum through 2025. Importantly, the energy major anticipates its investments to generate more than 30% returns. Overall investments in carbon capture are expected to rise in the coming days. You can see the complete list of todays Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . Further, ExxonMobil decreased the oil and gas production estimate to 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMboe/d) through 2025 from the previous expectation of 5 MMBoe/d. This implies that production for the next few years will remain flat with the 2020 level, even though output from the Permian Basin and Guyana will rise. ( What You Should Know From ExxonMobil's Long-Term Plan ) 4.  Equinor ASA EQNRrecently announced that it will make more investments in the Asgard license in the Norwegian Sea. The company, along with the partners in the license, intends to spend just below NOK 1.4 billion (around $163 million) in the field to make further developments. Moreover, the company is looking forward to implementing the Asgard B low-pressure project. The low-pressure project is expected to boost output from the current Smrbukk wells. To achieve this target, it awarded Aker Solutions with a NOK 800 million new contract, the scope of which incorporates engineering, procurement, construction and installation of new equipment for Asgard B platform modifications. In December 2019, a front-end engineering and design contract was provided to the same company. Notably, production in the field commenced in 1999 and the company still expects to produce 400-500 million barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) therein. While the current recovery rate at the field is 50%, it is aiming to reach 60%, which will enable it to generate greater value. The low-pressure production process is crucial to ensure improved recovery from the field, which is expected to begin in 2023. ( Equinor to Invest Further in Asgard Low-Pressure Project ) 5.  Canadian Natural Resources Limited CNQreported fourth-quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share of 12 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents, attributable to increased production from North America, lower costs and higher natural gas price realizations. However, the bottom line fell from the year-ago figure of 44 cents per share. The year-over-year underperformance was due to weak crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) price realizations. Total expenses incurred in the quarter were C$4,259 million, lower than C$5,079 million recorded a year ago. A decline in transportation costs and production expenses, along with higher foreign exchange gain, reduced the overall costs. Meanwhile, Canadian Naturals Oil Sands Mining and Upgrading operating expenses decreased 19% year over year to C$20.20 per barrel. As of Dec 31, the company had C$184 million in cash and cash equivalents, and a long-term debt of C$20,110 million, representing total debt to total capital of 38.3%. Further, the company generated free cash flow of C$694 in the fourth quarter. Canadian Natural Resources also declared a dividend of 47 Canadian cents a share, up 10.6% from the previous payout.

79,Risk management in oil and gas,energydigital,"Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10 00:00:00,"Follow@EnergyDigital	The March issue of Energy Digital magazine is live	By Chris Bohill	Chief executives of oil and gas companies might not want to be reminded of this fact, but typically a Oil and gas industry suffers brain drain Equally, supplier management is not confined to a piece of software. Any technology there is to enable you to develop and run your own supplier management process. If the software becomes a drain on resources or a barrier to openness, communication and co-operation, then it is not doing its job. In fact, software  while vital  is only one part of the mix. Proper supplier performance management is much more wide ranging, collaborative and relevant. The starting point should be: how can we work closely with our suppliers so that they share our goals, add value to our business now and over the long term, help us to manage our risks in all areas and improve total cost of ownership? The process for doing this should be simple and totally transparent. The only way that you manage the risk within the supply chain properly  or indeed any discipline  is to create visibility. Alignment of goals The next key principle is alignment of goals. The suppliers goals and values must be aligned with yours. With suppliers having such an impact in the success of your business how can you achieve your corporate goals and objectives if your key strategic suppliers are not rowing in the same direction? The simple answer is you cannot. At the same time, supplier performance management should drive the sharing of supplier innovation and application of best practices and continuous improvement, with the ultimate goal of becoming customer of choice, a key stepping stone in differentiating you from your competition. KPIs do, of course, have a role to play. But its important to use them both sparingly and highly selectively. KPIs should be the link between a companys corporate drivers and its large supply chain. They should encompass such issues as risk management/assessment, corporate social responsibility (CSR), health and safety protocols, communications, as well as quality, efficiency and cost expectations. A good supplier performance management partner should work around no more than 12 KPIs per supplier relationship. Benefits of proper management Its not just large oil and gas companies that are starting to see the benefits of proper supplier management. In many cases, especially among the big players, the suppliers themselves are adopting systems and presenting them as a benefit to their clients. This makes perfect sense because this approach offers a modern, co-operative alternative to the systems deployed by many procurement departments who are simply stuck in a rut. Its not their fault; its just that with so much of a companys operations being run through the supply chain, systems based on complex contracts, numerous irrelevant KPIs and heavy-handed control are simply not whats required now. The world has moved on and its time to rethink the relationship between oil and gas operators and their supply chains. When the profits are pouring in, as they are now all over this industry, nobody wants to fix something that doesnt appear to be broken. But management of supplier risk within the supply chain and the development of suppliers as key strategic partners is key to ensuring corporate goals and objectives are delivered, safely and without incident. Chris Bohill is the vice president of consulting and product strategy at Biznet. Biznet specializes in supplier performance management (SPM), helping clients to optimize and continuously improve suppliers performance, by creating transparency, reducing risk and improving operational efficiency.

A long-term ban on lease sales from the nations vast, publicly-owned oil and gas reserves to address climate change would fulfill a campaign pledge from Democratic President Joe Biden.

We will begin seeing companies starting to make decisions that will shift investments and jobs out of the U.S.. Milito said. The longer a suspension goes, he added, the more susceptible the administration will be to legal challenge. Democrats, environmentalists and left-leaning policy groups said the leasing program has remained unchanged for decades and needed to be reformed in the face of climate change.

85,Can Colombia Cash In On Higher Oil Prices?,oilprice,"Mar 09, 2021",2021-03-09 19:00:00,"Despite claims from the national government in Bogota that its energy sector is returning to a pre-pandemic footing, there are signs that Colombia's oil industry is struggling to restart operations Latin Americas fourth largest economy, Colombia, remains under considerable pressure. Even the latest oil price rally, which saw the international Brent benchmark gain 36%, has done little to kickstart the petroleum dependent economy. Colombias economy shrank 7% Spanish during 2020 and despite claims that it has returned to growth January 2021 unemployment soared to 17.3% its highest level since July last year. It is the poor performance of the Andean nations hydrocarbon sector which is weighing heavily on its economy. Despite claims from the national government in Bogota that the energy sector is returning to a pre-pandemic footing, there are signs that Colombias oil industry is struggling to restart operations.  Data from Colombias Ministry of Mines and Energy shows January 2021 hydrocarbon output Spanish declined. Crude oil production averaged 745,247 barrels daily which was 1.9% less than December 2020 and a whopping 16% lower compared to a year earlier. For the same month, Colombia pumped on average just over one million cubic feet of natural gas per day, a 1% reduction compared to a month earlier and 2% lower year over year. Total hydrocarbon output for the period reached 933,157 barrels of oil equivalent daily, a worrying 13% compared to the same month in 2020 and almost 2% less than a month prior.    Source Colombia Ministry of Mines and Energy and U.S. EIA.  Those numbers indicate that Colombias petroleum industry is struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels of production, which is impacting the Andean countrys petroleum dependent economy.  A key reason for this disappointing performance is that capital spending by energy companies in Colombia remains muted. Colombias peak industry body the Colombian Petroleum Association ACP-Spanish initials anticipates $3.1 billion to $3.45 billion of investment in Colombias industry during 2021. While that represents a 51% to 68% increase year over year it is still significantly lower than the $4 billion spent during 2019. A chronic lack of exploration drilling combined with lower than required development activity is weighing on Colombias proven oil and natural gas reserves as well as production. In April 2020, the energy ministry announced that Colombia had proven reserves of 2 billion barrels of crude oil and trillion feet of natural gas, which will support another six and eight years of production, respectively. Such limited hydrocarbon reserves emphasize the urgency with which Colombia needs to boost exploration drilling if it is to continue relying upon crude oil as a key economic driver.  Related $70 Oil May Cause Slowdown In Demand Recovery  According to the ACP spending on exploration projects during 2020 plunged to $350 million or less than half of the $780 mill invested a year earlier. High onshore breakeven costs, estimated to be $40 to $45 per barrel after-tax, are weighing on investment, even though Brent is now at $68 per barrel and appears poised to break though psychologically important $70 a barrel mark. There were no notable oil or natural gas discoveries made during 2020, primarily because of the major drillers in Colombia slashing annual capital expenditures, particularly those funds earmarked for exploration drilling. Colombia has not had a giant oil find since 1993 when BP discovered the Llanos Basin Cupiagua oilfield which has reserves of over 500 million barrels. During 2021, the industry body expects investment in exploration activities to average around $500 million to $550 million, which while a big jump from 2020 is still well-below exploration spending. Another concern is that 45% of 2021 exploration spending is expected to be used on the search for natural gas. While it is important for Colombia to boost its meagre natural gas reserves, particularly when domestic demand for the clean fossil fuel is expanding rapidly, that does decrease the likelihood of economically crucial significant crude oil discoveries being made. The ACP anticipates that 2021 exploration spending will fund the drilling of 40 to 45 new wells drilled in Colombia during 2021, or more than the 18 wells completed during 2020 but still less than the 48 drilled in 2019.    Source National Hydrocarbon Agency ANH  Spanish initials.  A key metric which is a handy measure of drilling activity is the Baker Hughes Rig Count. By the end of January 2021 there were only 14 operational drill rigs in Colombia, the same as a month earlier and almost half of the 27 rigs drilling at the of that period in 2020.  Related Is South Koreas Monster Wind Farm Feasible    Source Baker Hughes International Rig Count and U.S. EIA.  That further indicates that despite energy companies in Colombia bringing production back online and increasing exploration and development budgets there is still a considerable way to go before the tempo of operations reaches pre-pandemic levels.  A significant deterrent is growing unrest and violence in rural Colombia which is impacting the operations of the onshore petroleum industry. Security, or a lack of it, has become a leading issue for Colombias petroleum industry. The Andean country has experienced a sharp increase in the opposition to the hydrocarbon sector. That had led to community blockades and oilfield invasions forcing onshore oil producers to shutter operations. The severity of those community protests saw the ACP issue a December 2020 memorandum calling for a restoration of order after the seizure of oilfields in the Llanos Basin by indigenous protest groups. Oil pipeline attacks also remain an ongoing problem. The 210,00 barrel per day Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline has been attacked twice this year already, once in January and again earlier this month, it suffered 29 attacks on the pipeline last year. The Transandino pipeline which connects oilfields in the southern Putumayo Basin to the Pacific coast port of Tumaco is also a popular target, especially because like the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline it travels through remote rugged territory. These security issues were certainly part of the rationale behind Occidental Petroleums decision to divest its onshore Colombian oil assets for $825 million in October 2020.  There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the recovery of Colombias economically vital hydrocarbon sector since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. While investment is increasing, and oil companies have reactivated shuttered oilfields both crude oil and natural gas production continues to drift lower. High breakeven prices compared to other jurisdictions are weighing on investment decisions by foreign energy companies. Heightened security risks including the petroleum industrys deteriorating social license and opposition to the administration of President Duque further increase the uncertainty surrounding operations and the risk of production outages. Those issues are weighing on Bogotas ability to attract the required level of oil industry investment and attempts to restart the economy.

MORE froze new leases in January. The report will be based in part on feedback the department receives at a virtual forum on March 25. Participants in the forum will include industry figures, labor organizations, environmental and natural resource groups. The federal oil and gas program is not serving the American public well. Its time to take a close look at how to best manage our nations natural resources with current and future generations in mind, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Laura Daniel-Davis said in a statement. ADVERTISEMENT This forum will help inform the Departments near-term actions to restore balance on Americas lands and waters and to put our public lands energy programs on a more sound and sustainable conservation, fiscal and climate footing, she added. Biden implemented the moratorium on new leases a week into his presidency as part of a broader slate of climate and environment-related executive orders. The actions also included canceling the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and creating a Civilian Climate Corps modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps. The orders followed his day one order re-entering the U.S. into the Paris Climate Agreement. The conservation advocacy group Center for Western Priorities praised the announcement in a statement Tuesday, calling it an essential first step in fully transitioning to renewable energy, For too long, oil and gas companies have ripped off taxpayers while contributing to the climate crisis, Executive Director Jennifer Rokala said in a statement. This review sets the stage for a transition to a renewable energy economy, while ensuring communities and workers that are dependent on the boom-and-bust cycles of oil drilling are at the forefront of the solution. The Center for Biological Diversity, however, called the planned forum insufficient and said the Biden administration should make the leasing moratorium permanent. The federal fossil fuel programs need to face a full environmental review now, not a one-day meeting during a pandemic with select participants. If done correctly, that will show that federal fossil fuel programs must come to an orderly end, Taylor McKinnon, senior campaigner at the organization, said in a statement. The Biden administration did the right thing by suspending fossil fuel leasing of our federal lands and waters. Now it needs to be made permanent.

87,AETUF: 2 Small-Cap Energy Stocks to Buy for the Rebound in Oil,stocknews,"Mar 09, 2021",2021-03-09 17:31:00,"Oil prices have climbed back to pre-covid-19 pandemic levels in recent weeks, driven primarily by substantial OPEC+ production cuts and the resumption of industrial activity with the mass rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in major countries. The price of oil surged further after OPEC and non-OPEC ministers, in a recent meeting, agreed to hold production levels largely steady through April. Hence, we think it would be wise to bet now on ARC Resources (AETUF) and California Resources (CRC). These names are gaining handsomely with the rebound in global oil prices. ) are well-positioned to benefit from this trend. ARC Resources Ltd. ( AETUF ) Based in Canada, AETUF explores, develops, and produces crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas. The company  holds interests primarily in the Montney properties and Pembina Cardium properties. Last month,  AETUF and Seven Generations agreed to combine their businesses and entered an agreement to do so through an all-share transaction valued at approximately $8.1 billion. The strategic combination of the two premier Montney producers is expected to generate  significant free funds flow through a responsible and disciplined approach to development, while creating superior and enduring value for all shareholders. With its increased size and scale, the combined company expects to have improved access to capital and greater relevance in the global energy market. 5 WINNING Stock Chart Patterns Despite uncertain market conditions, AETUF strengthened its business in 2020 through prudent capital allocation decisions and excellent operational execution. AETUFs total crude oil production witnessed a slight sequential increase to 15,554 bbl/day in the fourth quarter, ended December 31, 2020. Its  revenue from commodity sales increased 10.8% year-over-year to C$351.90 million in the fourth quarter. Its net income has increased significantly from its  year-ago value to C$120.80 million, yielding an EPS of C$0.34 over the same period. Analysts expect AETUFs revenues to grow 41.1% year-over-year to $282.91 million in the current quarter (ending March 31, 2021). A  consensus EPS estimate of $0.07 for the quarter represents  a 57.9% improvement from its  year-ago value. The stock has gained 32.5% year-to-date. The POWR Ratings are also high on AETUF.

Dismantling oil and gas rigs to cost $52b Rebecca Gredley Published: Wednesday, 10 March 2021 3:32 am AEDT Most of Australia's offshore oil and gas infrastructure is off the coast of Victoria and WA. Credit: AAP Share to Twitter Email Us Australia's offshore oil and gas infrastructure has a hefty $52 billion decommissioning price tag attached to it. The costing is the focus of a report released on Wednesday to coincide with the announcement of the Centre of Decommissioning Australia, which aims to streamline the process in a bid to save $18 billion. The centre brings together major oil and gas companies including Chevron, Woodside Energy, Santos Limited, Esso Australia Pty, Vermilion Oil & Gas Australia and BHP. It also involves service and research groups. CODA has been set up by National Energy Resources Australia, whose general manager for decommissioning Andrew Taylor says about half of the $52 billion worth of work will begin within 10 years. ""If we are to improve our approach to decommissioning, we need to start today,"" he told AAP. ""All of these companies are required to carry decommissioning liabilities on their books, so it's in their interest to engage in a collaborative way to find a more efficient way to do this work. ""We are driving this to maximise the value for Australia out of these activities."" Most of the offshore oil and gas infrastructure is off the coast of Victoria and Western Australia. Decommissioning is expected to take 30 to 40 years. CODA wants Australian businesses to take up much of the work, which it says will lead to more opportunities as other nations go through the same process. Australia is looking to the UK and Norway for tips. ""If we've got 10 years to greatly accelerate our understanding and approach to these activities, then we really need to look at some of these other jurisdictions and work out how they've done it,"" Mr Taylor said. ""We are agnostic on whether things are good or bad for the environment but the companies doing the decommissioning have the opportunity to demonstrate if they think there is a potential environmental benefit to leaving structures in the ocean."" The centre is seeking proposals until April 9 for its first three projects, one of which is designed to ensure better understanding of local disposal and recycling opportunities. The other two projects relate to a review of decommissioning plans around the world and an innovation and technology road map for the process.",https://7news.com.au/politics/dismantling-oil-and-gas-rigs-to-cost-52b-c-2320305

Companies such as France's Totalor U.S.-based Chevron have worked for decades with the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), which, according to the UN investigator, ""is now controlled by the military junta and represents the single largest source of revenue to the state"". Below are facts about Myanmar's energy sector and the main players. TOTAL France's energy major has been a key player in Myanmar since 1992, developing the country's top gas fields, Yadana and Sein, which started producing gas in 1998. With a stake of 31.24 % Total has the status of operator. Other partners include Chevron with 28.26%, Thai PTTEP with 25.5% and MOGE with 15%. Located off Myanmar's southwest coast in the Gulf of Martaban, the Yadana fields primarily produce gas for delivery to power plants in Thailand. The fields also supply the domestic market via an offshore pipeline built and operated by MOGE, according to Total. In 2019, Total produced 1.3 billion cubic metres of gas in Myanmar, equivalent to 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) - a relatively small amount representing 0.5 % of Total's overall output of 3 million boed. Over the past decade, the share of Total production from the fields fluctuated between 13,000-21,000 boed. Even though volumes are modest, they are important for Myanmar. In 2019, Total paid $229.6 million to Myanmar, including $178.6 million to MOGE for produced and sold gas and $51 million in taxes to the ministry of finance. According to Total reports, between 2015-2019 the company paid a total of $786.5 million over five years, including $619.9 million to MOGE and $166.6 million to the ministry of finance. A consortium led by Total also won the rights to develop a terminal to import liquefied natural gas into an offshore terminal at Kanbauk, a 1,230 MW power plant and the supply of electricity to Yangon, to start up in 2023. Total, which employed 247 people in Myanmar in 2019, has said it was monitoring events and possible sanctions closely and was currently focusing on the safety of its workers. It said new projects in Myanmar were not a priority. TOTAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAWSUIT In 2002, four refugees from Myanmar filed a lawsuit against Total in Belgium. The four refugees also sued Total's chief at the time, Thierry Desmarest, for complicity in the torture and forced labour of workers who were building a pipeline from Yadana. Total has denied funding the military but has said the military paid soldiers to protect installations and workers. Total has repeatedly said Yadana was exempt from sanctions and it was acting as a positively engaged actor in the country. The case was closed in 2008 after several years of deliberations over whether the plaintiffs had the standing to bring the lawsuit because they were not Belgian citizens. CHEVRON The United States' second-biggest energy company Chevron is a partner of Total in Yadana with a 28.3% stake. Its share of production stood at 15,000 boed in 2019, also just a fraction of its global output of 3 million boed. Chevron says its deal with Myanmar on Yadana expires in 2028. Chevron also has a 28.3% non-operated interest in the pipeline company that transports gas to Thailand. The pipeline is known as Moattama Gas Transportation Company (MGTC) and has MOGE and Thai PTT as partners. Chevron has been disclosing payments to the government of Myanmar via the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). According to EITI data, Chevron paid around $50 million to Myanmar between 2014 and 2018. According to EITI's reports, payments to MOGE are with oil and gas in kind. According to Reuters calculations, based on figures disclosed by Total for Yadana payments and Chevron's share in Yadana, Chevron's payments to MOGE could be around $560 million between 2015 and 2019. PTTEP Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production, the upstream arm of state firm PTT, is a participant in all three major functioning projects in Myanmar. Thailand imports some 1,400 million cubic feet per day (mcfd) of gas, half of which comes from Myanmar. Since the military coup, PTTEP has said operations remain normal. In Yadana, PTTEP has been a partner of Total, Chevron and MOGE since 1992. According to Reuters calculations, based on figures disclosed by Total and PTTEP's share in Yadana, PTTEP payments should have amounted to close to $640 million between 2015-2019, including around $500 million to MOGE. PTTEP also has a 19.3% stake in the Yetagun project (Block M12, M13 and M14) which has been producing gas since 2000. Its partners in the project are Malaysia's Petronas with 40.91 %, Japan's Nippon Oil with 19.32% and MOGE with 20.45%. PTTEP also has an 80% interest in the Zawtika project (M9), which has been producing gas since 2003. MOGE has the remaining 20%. PTTEP plans a $2 billion gas-to-power investment including upstream development in Zawtika, a 600-MW power plant and transmission lines to supply 10% of Myanmar's existing installed power plant capacity. In exploration, PTTEP has 100% of Block 11, 80% of Block M-3 (Japan's Mitsui owns 20 %) and 50% of block MD-7 (Total has 50%). WOODSIDE PETROLEUM The Australian company said this month it was cutting its presence in Myanmar amid concerns over violence by security forces. Woodside is active in exploration in Myanmar and started a fresh drilling campaign in January. It is exploring for oil and gas on blocks A-6, A-7, AD-1, AD-7 and AD-8. Block A-6 is the most advanced and includes the drilling of up to 10 deep-water wells. Woodside says that since 2014 it has invested more than $400 million in Myanmar. The company plans to export gas by a-265 km pipeline to the Yadana complex and distribute gas via existing infrastructure. Woodside owns 40% in A-6. Other partners are Total and Myanmar's MPRL E&amp;P. SHELL AND OTHERS Shell is a partner of Woodside in block A7. Each hold 45% in the project with Woodside being the operator. Other global firms such as Equinor and ConocoPhillipsdivested from Myanmar over the past years. MYANMAR ON THE GLOBAL MAP The country's proven natural gas reserves totalled 1.2 trillion cubic metres as of 2019, according to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy, or around 0.5 % of global reserves. Myanmar produced 17 billion cubic metres of gas in 2019, or 0.4 % of global output. Energy thinktank Wood Mackenzie estimates that because of the coup new upstream projects worth $2 billion up until 2030, including the A6 project, now risk further delay.

90,Energy Report: Drone Blown,forexpros,"Mar 09, 2021",2021-03-09 14:35:57,"Commodities Analysis by Phil Flynn covering: Brent Oil Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures, Natural Gas Futures, United States Oil Fund, LP. Read Phil Flynn's latest article on Investing.com Oil prices are back on the rise as the market realizes that the fundamentals of the oil market are signaling tight markets and higher prices. The Monday oil dip came as speculators piled into the market on reports of the Houthi rebel drone attack on Saudi Arabia that failed to do any damage and exited by the close. Yet while the run in Brent oil may have been premature, it probably just coming attractions of more bullish price moves in the days ahead. We have been warning for months that the dramatic reversal of investment in oil and gas would drain inventories and leave the market undersupplied and it is becoming more apparent to the trade. Now with U.S. inventories getting ready to show the impact of the Texas power outages, we may start to see oil supplies fall below the five-year average at a time when we are seeing U.S. demand pick up. The question is will it show up in the oil numbers this week or next week. Platts reported that we saw refinery run losses of 70 million barrels with oil production of 20 to 25 million barrels. Already supplies of both gasoline and diesel are below the average range for this time of year and that is going to get worse. U.S. oil production is going to struggle to come back as investors do not want to make investments in shale only to have the Biden administration lay down the hammer. OPEC, which once feared the U.S. shale producer, is no longer fearful as they declared victory by rolling over their production cut. This means business in the U.S. and consumers better get ready for a summer of pain at the gas pump. Reduced stimulus checks will go into the gas tanks and the money will be going out to more foreign oil producers as U.S. shale recovery will be slow. I do not think Joe Biden is aware of the negative impact that his energy policies are going to have on poor Americans. He refuses to stand up to OPEC, but at least India is. Reuters reported that, India has asked state refiners to speed up the diversification of oil imports to gradually cut their dependence on the Middle East after OPEC+ decided last week to largely continue production cuts in April, two sources said. India, the worlds third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports about 84% of its overall crude needs with over 60% of that coming from Middle Eastern countries, which are typically cheaper than those from the West. Most of the OPEC+ producers, led by the worlds top exporter Saudi Arabia, last week decided to extend most output curbs into April. India, hit hard by the soaring oil prices, has urged producers to ease output cuts and help the global economic recovery. In response, the Saudi energy minister told India to dip into strategic reserves filled with cheaper oil bought last year. The U.S., even with the pullback in shale production, still helped keep Asia warm during its extremely cold winter. The Energy Information Administration said that the US exported more propane than distillate due to strong demand. The EIA says that in 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administrations (EIA) Petroleum Supply Monthly, U.S. exports of propane reached record levels, increasing 13% and surpassing distillate fuel oil as the countrys top petroleum product export. U.S. exports of distillate fuel oil fell to their lowest level since 2016. The increase in propane exports was driven by strong petrochemical and heating demand in Asia during a year of more U.S. production and less U.S. consumption. The United States experienced warmer-than-normal heating seasons in both the first and final months of the year, resulting in lower domestic propane consumption than in the previous two years. Although natural gas and crude oil production fell in the United States during 2020, propane production at natural gas processing plants increased 5.6% from 2019, which more than outweighed the decline in refinery production of propane. In 2020, 76% of U.S. propane was produced at natural gas processing plants; the remaining 24% was produced at petroleum refineries. Propane production outside of the United States decreased because major exporters such as Saudi Arabia and Russia reduced their propane production as a result of crude oil curtailments; most propane production in these countries is associated with crude oil. Expanded U.S. export capacity, along with increased domestic production and lower domestic consumption, allowed the United States to fill the supply gap and capture greater global market share. U.S. export capacity grew by an average of 330,000 barrels per day (b/d) during the second half of 2020. In contrast, distillate fuel oil exports, which usually account for the largest share of U.S. petroleum product exports, decreased in 2020. U.S. distillate exports of 733,000 b/d in May 2020 were the lowest for any month since June 2011, mostly because of less global demand. Distillate demand and production remained relatively low for the remainder of the year, unlike propane demand and production. U.S. distillate exports were also relatively low in the fourth quarter of 2020 when propane exports were at their highest. U.S. refiners may have faced increased competition in world distillate markets as a result of less expensive distillate from Europe. Spot prices for distillate from Europe were, on average, 12 cents per gallon (cents/gal) lower than U.S. New York Harbor distillate prices in the fourth quarter, compared with 7 cents/gal lower in the first three quarters.

91,"UPDATE 5-Chevron pitches investors on higher oil and gas output, modest spending plans",reuters,"Mar 09, 2021",2021-03-09 14:06:06,"Chevron Corp on Tuesday outlined a plan to expand oil and gas production through 2025 without spending significantly more and to limit the pace of growth of its carbon emissions. UPDATE 5-Chevron pitches investors on higher oil and gas output, modest spending plans By Jennifer Hiller 4 Min Read (Adds background) March 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp on Tuesday outlined a plan to expand oil and gas production through 2025 without spending significantly more and to limit the pace of growth of its carbon emissions. Falling energy demand due to pandemic-driven lockdowns sent the industry into a tailspin in 2020 and led Chevron to a $5.54 billion annual loss, its first since 2016. Investors have been pressuring Chevron and other big oil companies to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change, and rivals Royal Dutch Shell, BP Plc and Exxon Mobil have said their oil and gas output would remain flat or fall to stay in line with climate or financial goals. Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth made the case on Tuesday in an annual presentation to investors and analysts that Chevron could lower its carbon footprint and generate profits even if oil prices dip. Were not betting on higher prices to bail us out, Wirth said during the virtual presentation, pledging to send additional profits from rising oil prices to its balance sheet and shareholder returns. The tepid outlook for keeping project spending around $14 billion through 2025 did include a hint of chest-thumping in U.S. shale, an area that took the biggest capital spending cuts globally in 2020. Chevron will beef up investments over the next five years in the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, the top U.S. shale field where it previously slashed spending to save money, as the costs of a major expansion in Kazakhstan decrease. Permian production could reach 1 million barrels per day by 2025, it said, restoring a similar target it and Exxon set during dueling investor days two years ago and then had to dial back last year as prices crashed. Chevron will be the largest player in the Permian basin with a wide margin on production volumes over ExxonMobil, roughly 40% greater, said Peter McNally, analyst at Third Bridge. Chevron now targets a 35% reduction in its carbon intensity by 2028 and said it will eliminate routine flaring by 2030. But the intensity goals mean that emissions overall can increase if production rises, and it has not set a net zero carbon target like European and some U.S. peers. The companys carbon intensity goals lag the industry average and focus on its controllable elements rather than emphasis on building new business lines, said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets. Low-carbon spending around 2% of project spending shows Chevron is not pivoting its underlying operations, said Pavel Molchanov, analyst at Raymond James. Chief rival Exxon has pledged to boost its energy transition spending from 1% to 3%, while Shell plans to increase spending on low-carbon energy to 25% of overall capital expenditure by 2025. Oil and gas production for Chevron in 2020 was around 2.98 million barrels per day, and an investor presentation showed the company increasing output through 2025, though no numbers were given. A forecast of generating $25 billion in free cash flow through 2025 after dividends and spending is underwhelming and below Wall Street expectations, Borkhataria said. Chevron, the largest oil company to make a big purchase during last years market lows, doubled its cost savings expectations from the Noble Energy deal to $600 million, helping lower operating expenses 10% this year compared with 2019. The company also expects to more than double its return on capital employed (ROCE) through 2025. Excluding items, it reported an about 3% ROCE for 2020.

96,Operators eye renewables for oil and gas operations in Permian Basin,currentargus,"Mar 09, 2021",2021-03-09 09:57:00,"Wind and solar farms across the Permian Basin were estimated to provide about $283 million and $77 million in financial output, respectively. View Comments While the Permian Basin remained one of the U.S. most active oil and gas fields, it could soon become a hotbed of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. The region which stretches across southeast New Mexico and West Texas was known for decades to have vast oil and natural gas reserves beneath the surface. But the desert regions also featured abundant sun light and wind and energy companies are looking to cash in. Major oil and gas pipeline company Energy Transfer announced on Nov. 3 that it had purchased power from a solar farm being built in West Texas in Pecos County. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. The deal specified that Recurrent Energys Maplewood 2 Solar Project would provide power to Energy Transfer under a 15-year contract, Energy Transfers first solar-dedicated contract. The solar farm was expected to be in service by early 2021, per a news release from Energy Transfer. The Maplewood 2 Solar Project demonstrates our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint by integrating alternative energy sources when economically beneficial, said Mackie McCrea, Energy Transfer chief commercial officer. While we currently use a diversified mix of energy sources along with emission-reducing technologies to operate our assets, this project marks a new milestone for us as our first dedicated solar-powered facility. More: New Mexico's renewable energy sector growing in rural areas, local seek to capitalize Shawn Qu, chief executive officer of Canadian Solar, the parent company of Recurrent Energy, said the deal exemplified the diverse energy market in Texas. Our partnership with Energy Transfer on the Maplewood 2 Solar Project is emblematic of the diverse Texas energy landscape and represents the market-oriented business climate the state is so well known for, Qu said. Its tremendous to be working with Energy Transfer to provide an economical, clean energy solution that will support their U.S. operations. More: Report: Oil and gas leads New Mexico in greenhouse gas emissions, renewable sector growing The Maplewood 2 was Canadian Solar and Recurrent Energys third solar project constructed in Texas, the release read, providing a total of 385 megawatts of alternating current MWac. The Maplewood and Maplewood 2 projects were financed in July for $282 million, both located in Pecos County on about 2,000 acres. Maplewood will deliver 222 MWac to Anheuser-Busch to power its operations in the area, while Maplewood 2 will be dedicated to Energy Transfer. More: New Mexico's oil and gas regions could become the state's leaders in renewable energy Together, the facilities were expected to create about 500 construction jobs at peak activity and once operations, provide enough power for about 62,000 homes. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum announced last year that it would use a solar installation in Ector County, Texas near Odessa to power its drilling operations. The Goldsmith Field solar facility was planned to feature 174,000 photovoltaic panels, with a total capacity of 16 megawatts to power operations at the Goldsmith Field, an oil and gas reservoir located in the central Permian Basin. More: Xcel invests $7.1 million in Carlsbad power grid, continues push for renewable energy ""Occidental is taking an important step toward realizing our aspiration to become carbon neutral through the use of emissions-free solar electricity,"" said Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub. A study from energy research and consulting group Wood Mackenzie reported Texas to be fourth in the nation in solar power capacity in 2020, behind Arizona, Florida and California which led the nation. A September report from the Permian Strategic Partnership showed wind and solar farms across the Permian Basin in New Mexico and Texas were estimated to provide about $283 million and $77 million in financial output, respectively, often fueling oil and gas companies that seek to reduce their impact on the environment. More: Chevron uses renewables to power oil and gas operations, market shows signs of recovery Some oil and gas producers are using renewables to help power their operations, reducing emissions and increasing efficiency even further, the report read. With more than 92.3 billion barrels and nearly 300 trillion cubic feet of untapped oil and natural gas sitting below the surface and a limitless supply of wind and solar, energy production in the Permian Basin is expected to continue to grow for decades to come. The energy markets interest in solar and other renewable energy sources could help New Mexico reach its goal of 100 percent carbon free electricity by 2045. The aggressive goal was set by the Energy Transition Act when it was signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in early 2019. The Energy Transition Act fundamentally changes the dynamic in New Mexico, she said. This legislation is a promise to future generations of New Mexicans, who will benefit from both a cleaner environment and a more robust energy economy with exciting career and job opportunities.

Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. Novembers rig count marked a gain of five rigs from Octobers average of 45  the first major growth since COVID-19 took hold. The presence of the virus and increasing infections led to New Mexico and states across the U.S. implementing travel restrictions and other health orders to keep people at home and avoid the virus spread. This caused fuel demands to slump around the world and sent the price per barrel of domestic crude  much of which was produced in the Permian Basin region of southeast New Mexico and West Texas to unprecedented lows. More: Joe Biden's election as President sparks concerns for New Mexico's oil and gas industry By April, West Texas Intermediate (WTI)  a grade of crude used as a domestic pricing benchmark  was trading at less than $0 per barrel, records show, for the first time in history. The price quickly recovered in the following months but struggled to pass $40 per barrel and appeared far off from the pre-pandemic price range between $50 and $65 per barrel. Operators generally require at least about $50 per barrel to break even and become profitable. More: New Mexico GOP 'concerned' for oil and gas after 2020 General Election On Thursday, WTI was trading at about $42 per barrel per the latest oil future from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for December and was expected to spend most of next year higher than $43 per barrel. The price per barrels was at about $43 per barrel for the latter half of August but fell back down to about $36 per barrel and failed to grow above $40 per barrel for the rest of the fall, per historical data from Nasdaq. The combination of upward trending oil prices and New Mexicos rig count increasing for the first time since the pandemic hit could be a sign that New Mexico and the rest of the industry had begun its path to recovery. More: New Mexico sets hearing date to finalize new oil and gas methane rules The International Energy Agency (IEA), based in Paris, reported in its monthly report on Thursday that the an announcement from Pfizer on Monday that it had developed a vaccine for COVID-19 had led to an initial surge in oil prices this week, pushing up WTI and Brent Crude  the benchmark for much of Europes oil  to more than $45 per barrel. Brent typically trades about $5 to $10 more than WTI, although that gap has narrowed in recent years. The IEA cautioned that the market optimism created by the potential for a vaccine could be short lived as it was still unclear when the vaccine would lead to lifting of restrictions and an increase in demand for petroleum-based fuel such as for cars and airplanes. More: BLM planning to sell more New Mexico land to oil and gas in 2021 despite concerns However, it is far too early to know how and when vaccines will allow normal life to resume. For now, our forecasts do not anticipate a significant impact in the first half of 2021, the report read. Due to recent increases in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and Europe, the IEA lowered is forecast for global oil demand for the third quarter of 2020 by 0.4 million barrels per day (mb/d) and by 1.2 mb/d for the fourth quarter. The IEA expected the lingering impact of COVID-19 to decline by another 0.7 mb/d in the first quarter of 2021. More: Energy companies eye renewables for oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin In total, the IEA predicted global oil demand had fallen by 8.8 mb/d in 2020 but would rise by 5.8 md/d in 2021, as vaccines are unlikely to significantly boost demand until well into next year, the report read. In the here and now we continue to see surging caseloads, particularly in Europe and the United States, the report read. The recent announcements of lockdowns and other containment measures in many countries have led us to significantly lower our estimates for global oil demand.

In total, it is committed to converting 20 per cent of its fleet to electric power by the end of 2022 as part of a broader goal of complete fleet conversion to alternative power by 2028. While these kinds of lofty ambitions are getting significant attention, we are left wondering just how achievable they really are. California, for example, experienced blackouts this summer due to spikes in air conditioner use  how specifically is it going to handle the incredible demand from the conversion to electric vehicles in only 15 years? Likewise, a Wood Mackenzie report cited on the website electrekforecast that U.S. electric truck sales are expected to increase to over 54,000 by 2025  quite the prediction given there were only 2,000 electric trucks on the U.S. roads at the end of 2019. Some industry watchers, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, have been more skeptical, and have suggested semi-trucks and airplanes may be impossible to efficiently convert to electric power. We think many are also grossly overestimating the conversion of gasoline to electric and its impact on oil demand. When it comes to its ability to disrupt, EVs are lacking key components needed for scaling including affordability for the average consumer, and the overall lack of convenience and reliability. This could change with new battery technology for example, but this is a bet on something that just hasnt happened yet. Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Moving to the other side of that trade, in all of my years of covering the energy space I have never witnessed the level of pessimism as there is now. Despite WTI oil prices rebounding back to US$40 a barrel, U.S. and Canadian oil and gas producers are quickly approaching their March lows. Here in Canada, Suncor (SU:TSX) is trading only 11 per cent off its low whereas Exxon (XOM:NYSE) is 10 per cent off its low. For some further perspective, both stocks have lost more than 57 per cent of their value over the past five years. As a whole, Canadian producers as represented by the Capped Energy Index are down a whopping 65 per cent while U.S. producers as represented by the SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration and Producers Index have been crushed losing over 73 per cent of their value in the past five years. Think about this, especially with WTI oil prices only being down 4 per cent over the same period. Finally, take a look at the forward curve that currently has oil prices over $46 per barrel out in 2025 and over $51 per barrel out in 2030. According to Eric Nuttall, senior portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners, at those prices producers are currently trading at roughly half of their historical Enterprise Value to Cash Flow multiples, which in theory implies they are factoring in forward oil prices half that of what oil futures are currently trading at. If this is the case, it makes much more sense for companies to acquire a barrel than drill for it. Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Therefore, this begs the question, if oil commodity investors are not buying into the peak oil demand theory, why are oil stock investors? Only time will provide the answer but one has to wonder at the potential that exists for those brave enough to take the other side of yet another black and white story.

The New Mexico field advocate for national environmental group Earthworks said oil and gas facilities across the Permian Basin and in southeast New Mexico were responsible for air-polluting emissions with little oversight from the state, even as product slowed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Along a Wednesday tour of multiple sites near Loving, Eddy said she could smell gasses such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which gives a sweet, rotten-eggs-like odor, and documented what she called leaks of natural gases like methane and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). She said she documented malfunctioning flares, leaky storage tanks and compressor stations on the recent trip as part of Earthworks ongoing efforts to document pollution caused by the oil and gas industry in New Mexico. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. What were focusing on is whats coming out of the oil and gas process, Eddy said while filming potential emissions at the Pecos Compressor Station owned by Sendero Midstream. Were looking for a gap in the process thats not keeping the product moving. She said she also document what she called emissions at Caza Operatings Forehand Ranch natural gas processing site, and said Earthworks planned to file complaints. To film the potential sources of emissions, Eddy used a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera which can identify possible sources of excess gas releases. The camera cannot identify the rate of emission or the gas allegedly being released. More: Footage generated by Earthworks is used to file complaints with state regulators, and Earthworks has filed several, Eddy said, but seldom receive a response or any meaningful change. She said about five complaints were lodged against the compressor station visited during Wednesdays tour. We go back and go through the videos. Well look to see where were seeing leak and if it's close to a home,"" Eddy said. Its a process to triage which complaints are most important. More: New Mexico GOP 'concerned' for oil and gas after 2020 General Election Eddy worried New Mexico regulators lack the resources to adequately address the problem, with low staffing reported at the New Mexico Environment Department being met with increasing oil and gas production in recent years. The capacity of the agency is no match for the volume of whats going on here, she said. The alarming thing is for sites we first saw two years ago; a lot of the sites are still emitting. Less eyes can mean more emissions. To adequately address the issue, Eddy said permitting oil and gas operations should cease until meaningful regulations and oversight can be developed, or with more production going into the Permian as the oil and gas market recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, the problem could get worse. More: New Mexico sets hearing date to finalize new oil and gas methane rules What were up against is a huge problem, she said. As more production comes online, the emissions are inevitable. We arent seeing a reduction in emissions when we come out into the field. The emissions projected for the Permian Basin alone, its a global climate bomb. The pollution and the harm is chronic. And its cumulative. To begin cutting down on harmful emissions from the oil and gas industry, the State of New Mexico began developing stricter regulations last year aimed at curbing gas emissions and increasing gas capture at oil and gas facilities throughout the state. More: BLM planning to sell more New Mexico land to oil and gas in 2021 despite concerns The proposed regulations would increase requirements for technology used at facilities and would target a 98 percent gas capture goal by 2026, potentially instituting fines and other penalties for operators that fail to comply. The regulations faced criticism from environmental groups who worried flexibility the state intended to afford to low-producing wells and facilities would exempt many of New Mexicos oil and gas operations from the more stringent rules. New Mexico State Treasurer Tim Eichenberg said closing such loopholes in the States energy policy would help oil and gas continue to thrive while protecting the environment and mitigating climate change. More: Report: Oil and gas leads New Mexico in greenhouse gas emissions, renewable sector growing We appreciate Gov. Lujan Grishams leadership and her agencies hard work, he said. The finalization of regulations without loopholes will help New Mexicos oil and gas sector maintain its viability while addressing the economy-wide risks of climate change. A group of more than 40 investors called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to strengthen the draft rules, which could be codified by the states oil conservation commission in December, by removing any clauses that exempt oil and gas operators of any size from methane regulations. A recent study by the Environmental Defense Fund found that New Mexico oil and gas operations emit at least a million metric tons of methane per year and hundreds of thousands of tons of VOCs. More: Major Permian Basin oil and gas companies merge to survive coronavirus pandemic It is imperative that New Mexico get these rules right, said Johann Klaassen, executive vice president and chief investment officer at Horizons Sustainable Financial Services, a New Mexico based investment firm. We must recognize both the significant financial risks posed by climate change as well as the enormous economic opportunities for New Mexico provided by low-carbon and climate-resilient technologies, markets and business models. Another report from Synapse Energy Economics, an energy and economic research firm, showed the states proposed emission requirements  without the exemptions  would provide a 30 percent return on investment for New Mexico. More: Permian Basin's oil and gas water sector continues growth in Texas and New Mexico That included about $12 million in public health benefits, the study wrote, and $730 million of captured gas between 2020 and 2030 which would generate up to $99 million in state royalties. Alli Gold Roberts, director of state policy at Ceres  an environmental and investment non-profit organization said New Mexico must enact stronger policy to continue to keep the states oil and gas sector competitive with other markets as corporation begin to embrace more environmental values. Strong methane standards in New Mexico will be critical to support global competitiveness in a world with increasingly stringent climate policies and corporate emissions-reduction goals, Gold Roberts said. We appreciate the improvements already made to the draft rules, and call on regulators to close their proposed loopholes to further ensure the health and safety of New Mexicans are protected.

100,Biden election sparks concerns for New Mexico's oil and gas industry,currentargus,"Mar 09, 2021",2021-03-09 01:00:00,"Ryan Flynn with the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association said he was optimistic for the industry's future regardless of who was in the White House. View Comments In the wake of the 2020 Presidential Election and the nations apparent selection of former-Vice President Joe Biden as the U.S. 46th President, many in southeast New Mexico and the oil and gas industry were concerned about a shift in the national energy policy. Along the campaign trail, Biden was believed to have voiced support for policy actions such as an outright ban on new hydraulic fracturing activities or on oil and gas leasing on federal land. Republicans accused Democrats of aiming to shut down the oil and gas industry  a main economic driver in New Mexico  in favor of a transition from fossil fuels to an era of renewable energy. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. Carlsbad Mayor Dale Janway said that while various lawsuits regarding the election could continue to put its results into question, the Biden administrations possible curbing of fossil fuel development was troubling to communities in the Permian Basin. As weve mentioned in the past, a federal ban on fracking on public land would destroy New Mexicos economy while doing nothing to protect the environment. New Mexicos educational system cant afford a setback such as this, which would greatly reduce funding, Janway said. Several misguided attempts to ban fracking at the state level have been stopped, and we will continue to help resist them wherever it becomes necessary. Many of us are closely following the various recounts and lawsuits taking place across the country and believe the process of the presidential election is still ongoing at this time. Eddy County Manager Al Davis said the county was also awaiting the results of the Republican Party's challenges of the election results, but worried that efforts by Democrats and environmental groups at the state and federal level to restrict oil and gas operations could threaten the local and statewide economy. ""The objectives purported by these groups advocating for changes are well intended, but seem somewhat short sighted in terms of what the cost to an individual tax payer will be when those individuals are asked to bear the burden of a reduced influence from oil and gas activity in southeast New Mexico,"" Davis said. ""From my perspective efforts to support the oil and gas activity in New Mexico should continue to be higher priorities than many others that Ive observed that are getting some visibility on the legislative front."" Davis argued that the oil and gas industry is already heavily taxed at about 33 percent of revenues, and that policymakers should embrace the industry for the benefit of the nation and survival of southeast New Mexico. ""What we do understand is that there are efforts in motion with current State regulations and some agendas that have been represented through State and Federal legislators that make doing business in southeast New Mexico for industries like oil and gas more and more difficult and less and less attractive for committing investment dollars,"" Davis said. ""What many of those groups fail to recognize is what are the ultimate costs to implement their agendas? Who will pay for those costs, while they disregard the lost revenue and tax support that would result from a diminishing oil and gas industry in southeast New Mexico?"" More: New Mexico GOP 'concerned' for oil and gas after 2020 General Election New Mexico oil and gas 'not going anywhere' The proposed ban on new oil and gas leases on federal land would impact New Mexico disproportionately, per a study from the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, but Executive Director Ryan Flynn said the industry is willing and ready to engage in discussions on such policy with the Biden administration. He said he was optimistic about oil and gas future in New Mexico and the U.S., regardless of who was in the White House. The fact that both candidates made energy policy a major issue for their campaigns speaks to the importance of the issue. Our job is to work with policy makers, Flynn said. Whether its about a federal ban on leasing or some of the other policies that would make development difficult, we will be engaging in these discussions and continue advocating for our industry. More: New Mexico sets hearing date to finalize new oil and gas methane rules The study published by NMOGA in September reported a ban on oil and gas leasing on federal land  where a large portion of New Mexicos oil and gas development occurs  could cost New Mexico 62,000 jobs by 2022 while also risking up to $1 billion in state revenue from the industry that makes up 40 percent of New Mexicos budget. There policy decisions affect every single New Mexican, Flynn said. Energy policy was a huge part of the Presidential campaign and were ready to work with President-elect Biden. My takeaway from the election is there is a need for problem solvers. Our industry is full of problem solvers. As for New Mexicos shift to renewables, which was supported by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham since she took office in 2019 and signed the Energy Transition Act into law, Flynn said the state and nation should have a diverse energy portfolio including renewables and oil and gas side by side. More: BLM planning to sell more New Mexico land to oil and gas in 2021 despite concerns A diverse portfolio provides a reliable source of energy, he said. What people say on the campaign trail, what weve seen is leaders evolve when they get in and understand the impacts of different sectors. Our sector is essential and a big part of our country moving forward. The idea that Democrats and others seek to end oil and gas production is not grounded in reality, Flynn said. Anytime there is a change in power, people have concerns about the policy implications, he said. Our industry has continued to evolve and were not going anywhere for decades to come. More: Major Permian Basin oil and gas companies merge to survive coronavirus pandemic Tom Kiernan, chief executive officer of the American Wind Energy Association said the industry planned to work with the Biden administration to pursue a goal of 100 percent carbon-free energy by the middle of the century. Wind energy is one of New Mexicos fast-growing energy sectors, with nine active leases with a capacity of 345 megawatts for wind projects on State Trust land and 19 pending applications to add 1,835 megawatts in the coming years, per data from the New Mexico State Land Office. The Land Office also reported six active leases for 221 megawatts for solar projects in the state, with 27 lease applications being processed to add 2,917 megawatts. The President-elect and his team have laid out an ambitious, comprehensive approach to energy policy that recognizes renewable energys ability to grow Americas economy and create a cleaner environment, while keeping electricity costs low and combating the threat of climate change, Kiernan said.

MINISTRY OF MINES AND ENERGY Cambodia chalks up five oil wells Tue, 9 March 2021 Thou Vireak Singapore-based oil and gas firm KrisEnergy Ltd began extracting crude oil from four additional wells late last month, according to Cheap Sour, a senior official at the Ministry of Mines and Energy. This comes after the December 28 maiden oil extraction from the A-01D well  part of the five-well mini-platform featured in KrisEnergys Mini-Phase 1A development  in the offshore Cambodia Block A concession of the Khmer Basins Apsara oilfield. And the PV Drilling III jack-up rig began drilling the remaining four wells A-02D through A-05D on January 30, according to Prime Minister Hun Sen. Sour, director-general of the ministrys General Department of Petroleum, told The Post that If the five wells perform well, [KrisEnergy] will drill even more wells as their plans dictate. In late December, Hun Sen said the Kingdom could net about $30 million per annum from the commodity if international oil prices remain at around $55 per barrel, citing predictions from energy minister Suy Sem. Estimates show that well pump out between 7,000 and 7,500 barrels a day, which is a considerably miniscule volume that wont leave a profound impact on our economy soon, but a good start for the oil and gas industry in Cambodia, the prime minister said. December 28s highly-anticipated milestone extraction from offshore Block A made the Kingdom the eighth oil producer in the 10-member ASEAN, with only Singapore and land-locked Laos not producing crude. In a press statement issued the following day, Kelvin Tang, president and CEO of KrisEnergys Cambodian operations, stressed that Apsaras first drop of oil marks a 10-year journey from when KrisEnergy initially became a partner in Block A. I convey my heartfelt appreciation to all relevant ministries and authorities for their assistance, cooperation and their dedication to get the Apsara oil development over the line. KrisEnergy is honoured to be a part of this historic occasion, he said. With Covid-19 hanging over the world, Tang added: Progressing Apsara to first oil has been a tremendous achievement and a testament to the determination of the KrisEnergy team and the strong cooperation of our contractors and suppliers. Our task now is to complete drilling of the four remaining wells, stabilise production and monitor performance so that we may assess the best path forward to optimise Cambodias oil production and the value of the asset in the years ahead.

103,Bidens Energy Secretary To Oil Industry: Adapt Or Die,oilprice,"Mar 08, 2021",2021-03-08 21:00:00,"The new presidential administration has hit the ground running on climate change, with new Energy Secretary Granholm telling the oil industry they need to accelerate their efforts to to become net-zero Related: Saudi Surprise Cut May Have Lasting Effect On Oil Prices Now, just when oil prices are stabilizing and the shale industry is adjusting to the new normal, the last thing those dependent on the fossil fuel sector want is more adversity. But for Granholm, this view--that the Biden administration is leaving oil and gas workers behind--is a shortsighted one. Instead, she says that oil and gas companies should be jumping at the chance to grow and innovate to stay relevant in the new, increasingly decarbonized global economy. Its not the Biden administration thats leaving oil and gas workers behind, the thinking goes--its stubborn oil and gas execs. The bottom line is this particular growth of clean energy and reduction of carbon provides a huge opportunity and Im extending a hand of partnership, Granholm said at the CERAWeek conference on Wednesday. She has a point. Around the world, global leaders are getting serious about climate change and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. According to data gathered by the worlds premier authority on global warming, The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we have just one decade left to change course and avoid the worst effects of climate change. Right now, were on a collision course, but world leaders as well as private sector head honchos are lining up to change that. Related: Worlds Top Oil Trader: OPEC+ Controls The Market In Europe, Big Oil is already well into its transition to becoming Big Energy. Even China is getting serious about cutting its carbon footprint. The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment trend has gone mainstream, and some experts say that peak oil is already upon us . It would be both naive and misguided to suggest that the world no longer runs on fossil fuels--it does, and will continue to do so for years to come. If, for some reason, the world were cut off from fossil fuels overnight, the results would be catastrophic. But the heyday of oil and gas has come and gone, and the future will reward those who have adapted to a decarbonizing economy. Critics are correct to point out that telling fossil fuel workers to get jobs building solar panels is overly simplistic and deaf to the needs and struggles of this huge and imperiled workforce. But the real point is that those jobs are evaporating like it or not, with or without the Biden administration. Yes, the timeline will likely be shortened by current presidential priorities, and the seriousness of these prospects for oil- and coal-town economies cant and shouldnt be overstated, but in the long term, the outcome is the same. Its time to adapt--or get edged out by another country that had no qualms about setting aside their allegiance to oil.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, if the Appalachian region were an independent country, it would be the third-largest natural gas producer in the world. Job creation and economic growth through the natural gas industry cannot be overstated. Its why Ive pushed so hard to create a natural gas storage hub in West Virginia. Sadly, natural gas growth faces tremendous headwinds over the next four years. Despite calls for unity, in some of his first actions, President Biden managed to kill thousands of jobs and paralyze Americas energy industry with executive orders. The Biden moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands is an economic, energy and national security disaster rolled into one. This order moves America from energy independence back to relying on foreign adversaries for fuel  countries who have much laxer environmental standards. This action is indicative of the incoming climate agenda that will have drastic impacts on West Virginias energy sector. The forces against natural gas are growing. And theyre against natural gas, nuclear or any other energy source thats not blessed by the Green New Deal. President Biden installed Gina McCarthy and John Kerry as his climate czars. Both are unaccountable to Congress and have made clear theyre the ones in charge of the administrations ambitious climate agenda. By claiming every policy issue touches climate, McCarthy and Kerry have broad jurisdiction to do their bidding. Theyve made no secret of their ultimate goal: Banning fossil fuels. In fact, Kerry suggested folks should go work on solar panels. I have great skepticism when I hear this administration talk about giving industry time to transition and giving workers clean energy jobs. Tell that to the Keystone XL pipeline workers. Where are their clean energy jobs? Do they get a new clean energy job tomorrow? Next month? Next year? West Virginia has powered this country for decades. Were incredibly proud of that fact. Coal, natural gas, oil, solar, wind, nuclear, biomass: Our country has been incredibly blessed with a variety of energy resources, and using all of them keeps America safe and running. Natural gas in particular burns cleaner, moves safely and efficiently in our world-class national pipeline network, and is an essential feedstock for several domestic supply chains like medical supplies, which are critical now more than ever during this pandemic. Environmentalists fighting against natural gas cant see the forest for the trees. Eliminating natural gas from our energy mix will lead to higher utility costs and less reliability  just ask California. Renewables cant power our country at 100 percent all the time, and battery technology cant fill the gaps. But we can address climate change together though innovation and technology. Sadly, President Bidens climate executive orders really alienated key players in the solution. Thats not a way to build unity. Thats picking winners and losers. Thats pitting American jobs against each other. Thats creating resentment. This country has always risen to every challenge weve faced. This climate challenge is no different. Through American ingenuity, we will find solutions. U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito is the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee You must be logged in to react.

View Comments Oil and gas producers in New Mexico were required by the Produced Water Act to report their water usage to the state to track produced water as it was generated and used in extraction operations. Operators began reporting water use this fall and the Oil Conservation Division (OCD)  an arm of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD)  published the reports in an online database. The database specifies the name of the operator, the facility, the date fracking occurred, the quantity of water used and type. The four types of water include: produced, fresh, brackish and saline water. More: Occidental Petroleum partners with New Mexico State University on produced water research Produced water is a combination of flowback water that returns to the surface after pumped underground via hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and formation water brought to the surface along with oil and gas from subsurface shale deposits. Traditionally, operators disposed of the water by pumping it back underground, but recently operators began recycling and reusing produced water in subsequent fracking operations as drought conditions intensified. New Mexico regulators also sought to better track the generation and use of produced water as it moved within the industry and potential reuse in other sectors such as agriculture. More: Permian Basin's oil and gas water sector continues growth in Texas and New Mexico OCD Director Adrienne Sandoval said the data reported by operators and published online was essential to developing future produced water regulations in assessing the scale of water used in the oilfield and its management. EMNRD and the OCD were tasked with regulating produced water within the industry, while the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) was assigned any future regulation for potential use outside of oil and gas. The Produced Water Act does not yet allow for any non-oil-and-gas produced water uses. More: New Mexico eyeing stricter regulations, more fines on oil and gas spills Under the Produced Water Act, operators must report the type and quantity of water used in drilling operations within 45 days of well completions. Sandoval said the online component would assist operators and regulators reporting and assessing water usage in oil and gas operations throughout the state. The OCD is working to transition all of our reporting and permitting forms to an online format, saving resources and improving transparency and efficiency, Sandoval said. The new information provided by these reports is an important step forward in understanding the size and scope of produced water use in the oil field. More: Oil and gas wastewater investments continue in Permian Basin, group calls for stricter rules Added regulations were approved earlier this fall by state regulators for the management of produced water in implementing the Act. Our goal is to create regulations that are protective of human health and the environment, reduce industry reliance on fresh water and encourage science-based and innovative solutions, said NMED Cabinet Secretary James Kenney. To that end, we are including a diverse group of voices from the beginning to ensure these future regulations are done right. Here are the oil and gas operators who have reported produced water use in operations since the portal went live. More: Mewbourne Oil Company Mewbourne reported 13 of the 16 water use reports published online by the OCD. The companys first two reports were for fracs Oct. 19 at its Red Hills Unit in Lea County. Records show Mewbourne used about 26.7 million gallons of produced water for one frack, and 26.4 million for the other. On Oct. 20, Mewbourne filed three report for fracks at its Styx 17 facility in Eddy County, using 5.5 million gallons and about 5.8 million gallons of brackish water for each. More: New Mexico finalizes oil and gas wastewater regulations, lawmakers hear testimony Ten days later Oct. 30, Mewbourne reported 20.6 million gallons or produced water at one fracking, and 20.9 million gallons at another. Back at the Red Hills West Unit, on Nov. 5, Mewbourne reported about 26.2 million gallons of produced water. And on Nov. 20, the operator reported about 11 million gallons of produced water and 7.4 million gallons of brackish water from each of four fracks: two at the Creedence 21 16 facility and two at the Kansas 21 28 facility in Eddy County. More: Tap Rock Operating The operator reported water usage in three reports at its Cypress 34 facility in Eddy County. On Oct. 15, records showed 11.8 million gallons of brackish water was used at the facility, along with about 12 million on Oct. 17 and 11.4 million on Oct. 19. No freshwater was reported to have been used by either operator as of Monday.

The Next U.S. Oil And Gas Boom Suddenly Looms On The Horizon The Next U.S. Oil And Gas Boom Suddenly Looms On The Horizon in Oil & Companies News 08/03/2021 The history of the oil and gas business in the United States is that every time the experts all line up to declare it to be dead, it finds a way to come roaring back. This scenario has played itself out at least half a dozen times across my own 42-year career in the business or writing about it. Well, guess what: It appears to be happening again. I was about to say that it appears to be about to happen again, but the truth is that the domestic oil and gas industry has already staged a significant comeback from the depths of its COVID-19-induced depression last summer. Take the Enverus Daily Rig Count as an example: On September 1, 2020, that metric showed the number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. sat at just 276 rigs, depressingly near its all-time low. As of today, that number has risen to 460 active and working rigs, a 2/3rds increase in just six months. As well, the Primary Vision count of active U.S. frac spreads had recovered all the way to 175 as of February 12, more than double the count of just 85 as of August 28 of last year. That count fell all the way to just 41 active spreads during the disastrous arctic freeze event that struck Texas, Oklahoma and other shale states in mid-February, but had recovered back to 140 as of the last available count on February 26. Granted, these rig and frac spread numbers remain well below the highs of late 2019/early 2020, but they still represent a remarkable turnaround from the depths of the depression in just half a year. This becomes especially impressive when one considers that it has been achieved amid continuing mediocre financial results from big shale producers and ongoing tightness in the financial markets related to the funding of major shale-related projects in the U.S. While those financial factors continue to place pressure on corporate producers to focus on cutting costs and elevating investor returns, as we have discussed several times in the past, the natural inertia within companies that are still run by engineers and geo-scientists  rather than investment bankers and accountants, as so many are now  is still to drill more wells. Healthier commodity prices only serve to magnify that natural internal inertia. We certainly do have healthier commodity prices now. Goldman Sachs GS -0.6%, one of the bellwethers for those who like to pay attention to future oil price forecasts, recently raised its forecast for the mid-year West Texas Intermediate price to $72 per barrel. It is key to note that that increased estimate was published on February 22, well before the OPEC+ group surprised markets on Thursday by agreeing to essentially maintain its status quo on current production and export levels through the end of April. Given that that announcement has already resulted in an increase of 10% in the price for WTI as of this writing Friday morning, Goldman and other price forecasters could have another increased estimate for WTI coming in the near future. In fact, Goldman Sachs raised its projection for 3rd quarter, 2021 Brent prices to $80 on Friday morning. Key will be the potential shale supply response, although the latest earnings season suggests investors are still a long way away from rewarding growth, the bank said. It simultaneously raised its forecast for 2022 U.S. shale production by 300,000 barrels per day. Interestingly, Goldman Sachs also forecasts the Brent price to remain at a very robust level  $75 per barrel  through the end of 2022. Given the current low differential between Brent and WTI of just $3 per barrel, that would indicate a WTI price of $72 through the start of 2023. Lets all remember that the U.S. shale industry boomed like never before throughout 2018 and 2019, a time during which WTI traded in a range of $53 to no higher than $72 per barrel. While it is true that the financing market for new shale projects remains tight, it is also true that shale producers who have spent the last two years heavily-focused on cutting costs, increasing efficiencies and deploying improved technologies are now able to present a far more attractive profile to potential investors than they could in 2018. Thats what a depression will do to the companies that manage to live through it. Another factor to keep in mind is that corporations arent the only significant players involved in the shale equation. In fact, Bloomberg recently reported that, as of December, privately held companies like DoublePoint Energy and Mewburne Oil Co. were running half of the active drilling rigs in the Permian Basin. Companies like these have different internal drivers and less pressures coming from ESG-focused investors than corporations, and thus present something of a wild card for those attempting to predict where overall U.S. production might head in the coming months. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that domestic oil production for December was roughly 11.06 million barrels of oil per day, about 1.8 million barrels below the peak seen in November, 2019. It is interesting to note that the domestic industry was able to hold production levels relatively stable throughout the second half of 2020 despite running a very low number of active drilling rigs. The various elements of the U.S. oil industry outlook equation all still revolve around the central element of what will OPEC+ do? Or, as Goldman analyst Damien Courvalin put it, We were already bullish [on] oil prices because we expected OPECs conservative demand expectations to leave its ramp-up lagging our above consensus demand forecasts. Bottom line: Given that caveat assuming that the current discipline of the OPEC+ group continues to hold together for the coming two year time frame, the domestic oil and gas business is likely headed for another boom time. It will probably be more modest than the last boom, given the more disciplined outlook of the corporate players, but a boom it will most likely be.

109,Increased Oil And Gas Demand Drives The Integrated Geophysical Services Industry,einpresswire,"Mar 08, 2021",2021-03-08 11:18:29,"The Business Research Companys Integrated Geophysical Services Global Market Report 2021: COVID 19 Impact and Recovery to 2030 https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/integrated-geophysical-services-global-market-report Increasing demand for oil and gas contributed to the growth of the integrated geophysical services market. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2018, consumption of Gas/diesel was 12,97,065 Kt globally. According to the US Energy Information Administration estimates, global consumption of petroleum and liquid fuel averaged 94.3 million barrels per day in 2019, and it is expected to increase by 6.5 million barrels per day in 2021. The increasing consumption of oil and gas is driving the demand for integrated geophysical services. This is because integration between different oil and gas exploration methods as archaeological surveys and remote sensing from aerial platforms and satellite obtain required geological information and evaluate core samples or cuttings. The sub-surface analysis is important for accurate reservoir and flow modelling leading to more informed production decisions and the ability to produce more energy. The increasing demand for oil and gas is therefore driving the integrated geophysical services market. The global integrated geophysical services market sizeis expected to grow from $1.35 billion in 2020 to $1.46 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1%. The growth is mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The global geophysical services market is expected to reach $1.51 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 0.8%. The integrated geophysical equipment and services market covered in this report is segmented by method into vertical electrical sounding; electrical resistivity tomography (ERT); seismic refraction; microgravity survey with differential GPS; magnetic profiles; induced polarization; 2D seismic prospection (refraction tomography and reflection sections); ground penetrating radar (GPR) and by application into infrastructure and building constructions; offshore wind farm surveys; offshore cable tracking surveys; mineral exploration and mining engineering; natural resources and energy; water resource, environment and waste management; archaeological surveys.

110,Stop oil and gas drilling in Namibias Kavango Basin immediately  Anglican Church,mg,"Mar 08, 2021",2021-03-08 11:09:02,"Thirty-four bishops and three archbishops decry exploratory drilling as a sin against the Earth 0 Thirty-four Anglican bishops and three archbishops from around the world have signed a petition that respectfully calls on Namibias and Botswanas governments to halt exploratory drilling in the Kavango Basin in northern Namibiaimmediately. In their petition, the faith leaders decry the imminent desecration of the Kavango Basin in Northern Namibia and Botswana by Canadian oil and gas company, ReconAfrica The signatories include the Archbishop of Cape Town, Reverend Dr Thabo Cecil Makgoba ; Archbishop Julio Murray, the chair of the Anglican communion environmental network; Archbishop Mark Macdonald from the Anglican Church of Canada; and Bishop Kito Pikaahu, chair of Anglican indigenous network; and the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Reverend Nicholas Roderick Holtam. ReconAfrica claims that drilling the Kavango basin is pretty much a no-brainer, the petition reads. We call it a sin. To destroy life and Gods creation is simply wicked. ReconAfrica has acquired rights to exploremore than 35 000km in the Okavango Deltawatershed, a Unesco-designated world heritage site. This environmentally sensitive, protected area supplies water to the Okavango Delta. It is a world heritage and Ramsar wetland site, a key biodiversity area and one of the seven natural wonders of Africa, their petition reads. The petition will be handed over on Monday 8 March to Namibias government, the Namibian consulate in Cape Town, the headquarters of ReconAfrica in Vancouver, Canada, and the Canadian ombudsperson for responsible enterprise As faith leaders, the signatories state that they are called to speak up for those who have no voice and defend the rights of the needy. Drilling in the Kavango Basin will fracture its geological structure and destroy the water system that supports this unique ecosystem and wildlife sanctuary In doing so, it will also disrupt the livelihoods of the indigenous people, the petition reads. Oil and gas drilling will bring vast wealth to a few but will further impoverish northern Namibia people, exacerbating climate change and destroying their traditional way of life. ReconAfrica is putting financial interests before life. We believe in restorative social and environmental justice, and we call upon the international community to support Namibia and Botswana to develop renewable energy systems and help safeguard the precious Kavango ecosystem, the petition reads. The region is home to the largest remaining population of African elephants and 400 species of birds, as well as being a sanctuary for many other animals. It is protected under the protocol of the Permanent Okavango River Basin Water Commission This exploration violates San rights under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples It affects three regional : the Okavango Delta, the Tsodilo Hills and the San Living Cultural Landscape, reads the petition. Unconventional oil and gas exploration and extraction will bring roads, heavy trucks, ribbon development and pollution. These will disrupt the culture and ancestral heritage and ecosystem dependent subsistence livelihoods of the San people. It will also negatively affect low-impact eco-tourism, which provides a sustainable income to guides, crafters and artists, the petition reads. ReconAfrica has denied pursuing unconventional methods, including hydraulic fracturing or fracking which is designed to recover gas and oil from shale rock. Still, its marketing material and investor presentations refer to the pursuit of both conventional and unconventional methods. Last month, the company told the Mail & Guardian that the focus is not fracking RELATED: Water is a scarce and precious commodity in Namibia, the driest country south of the Sahara, say the faith leaders. Namibia is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. With almost unrivalled solar-energy potential, extracting billions of barrels of oil makes no sense. Reducing carbon emissions is a global responsibility, reads the petition. Indications are that the deal between ReconAfrica and the Republic of Namibias government was concluded behind closed doors, say the faith leaders. Initial meetings were only held in northern Namibia. Only under duress was a further meeting organised in Windhoek, the capital city. Concerns raised by local activists have been belittled, and The Namibian the national newspaper which broke the story, is being threatened with legal action, the petition reads The environmental impact assessment submitted by ReconAfrica does not comply with strict Namibian government standards, they say. The enormous potential of this oil reserve claimed by ReconAfrica is also under question, because previous geological explorations in Botswana and Namibia have never found such evidence, the petition says. For humans to destroy the integrity of Earth by causing changes in its climate, by stripping the Earth of its natural forests, or destroying its wetlands  for humans to contaminate the Earths waters, its land, its air, and its life with poisonous substances, these things are sins. A silent protest will be held on the steps of St Georges Cathedral on Thursday at midday. Last week, the nonprofit organisation Save Okavangos Unique Life sent a petitionto Namibias agriculture, water and land reform minister, calling for an immediate moratorium on ReconAfricas current petroleum-exploration activities. On 25 February, Namibias minister of environment, forestry and tourism Pohamba Shifeta said it is premature and confusing to discuss the risks of one unconventional type of production method that has not even been applied for by the company [ReconAfrica]. Only if the exploration well discovers oil and gas, the final step in the exploration process will be to determine the economics of the find and to assess the characteristics of the reservoir and to determine if the discovered oil or gas can be produced economically using either conventional or unconventional production methods, he said in Namibias national assembly. This key step in the process, Shifeta said, will require further approval, from the appropriate regulatory authorities. It remains to be seen, he said, whether Namibia has a commercially or economically viable oil or gas reserve at the exploration sites, and whether there is a compacted sedimentary reservoir rock that would require the use of unconventional oil or gas production processes such as fracking in the area.

111,"New Mexico oil and gas recovery to continue until 2024, analyst says",currentargus,"Mar 08, 2021",2021-03-08 10:00:00,"Bernadette Johnson, vice president of market intelligence for Enverus, presented a market outlook to New Mexico's Legislative Finance Committee. View Comments New Mexico could be looking at up to three more years before the oil and gas industry recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently collapsing oil prices. The pandemic and subsequent global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders led to an historic decline in the oil markets, with the price per barrel of domestic crude plummeting as low as $40 per barrel in April a month after the virus first hit New Mexico. In a Tuesday presentation to the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee, Bernadette Johnson, vice president of market intelligence at Enverus  a global energy market analytics firm  said the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) must grow to $60 per barrel for the markets to be considered recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. To initially hit that mark, she said, could take until the end of 2022 and until 2024 for the price to stabilize in the $60 per barrel range. Prices already saw significant improvement this year to about $40 per barrel since collapsing in the second quarter but could dip again to about $30 per barrel in early 2021, Johnson said. Prices have recovered significantly since Q2, she said. Q2 was a time of upheaval. Since then, prices have recovered to back around the $40 per barrel market, but they havent gone much above that. Were still facing an uphill battle. More: Joe Biden's election as President sparks concerns for New Mexico's oil and gas industry Increases in the price of oil relies heavily on refinery activity, Johnson said, as an oversupply would lead to refinery capacity filling up and less purchasing of crude oil that could be turned into gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. Declines in jet fuel demand, led by a drastic decrease in travel across the world, took the biggest hit, she said, while gasoline and diesel recovered but continued lagging behind pre-pandemic demand. The biggest challenge we still have is demand, Johnson said. A lot of folks are still working from home. Theyre not using as much gasoline as they were. More: New Mexico oil and gas show signs of recovery after potential COVID-19 vaccine announced For the market to reach equilibrium, she said, fuel demand must increase while supply decreases. When the pandemic hit, the U.S. was amid a record-breaking boom in production which created a glut in oil and gas reserves when demand curtailed, and a drop in the price per barrel. We had a significant oversupply situation as soon as the pandemic hit. The market had way too much supply. That means every single day that were not using it, we have to put it in storage, Johnson said. You have to have supply and demand come back. Then, you need demand to be above supply. Thats how you pull these products out of storage. More: Oil, gas markets recover slightly from COVID-19, investments return to Permian Basin The current price range of about $40 per barrel does not support production growth in many oil and gas areas across the country, Johnson said. But it does support some growth in the Permian Basin, New Mexicos main oil and gas region, and could be responsible for a slight uptick in the states rig count  increasing to 54 rigs as of yesterday and climbing above 50 rigs for the first time since the pandemic hit. Still, New Mexico saw a massive decline of about 60 percent in its rig count since the same point of 2019. More: New Mexico sets hearing date to finalize new oil and gas methane rules New Mexico Sen. John Arthur Smith (D-35), chair of the Legislative Finance Committee, said New Mexico policy makers must find revenue streams more reliable than the volatile oil and gas industry. He said New Mexico was overly reliant on oil and gas, getting massive budget surpluses recently climbing to nearly $3 billion, but was also uniquely vulnerable to the downturns or bust cycles created by constantly shifting market factors. New Mexico is so heavily reliant on the oil and gas industry when we look at our general fund revenue, were more vulnerable to the huge swings, Smith said during the presentation. Your presentation has given us a grace period to come up with more reliable revenue streams. Ive been here 30 years and weve been really good at procrastinating on that. When you have $3 billion coming from oil and gas, its weighted far too much in that direction. I encourage legislators to come up with a more reliable energy stream. More: Joe Biden's election as President sparks concerns for New Mexico's oil and gas industry But Republican lawmakers from the oi-heavy southeast region like Sen. Gay Kernan (R-42) said the industry that served as powerful driver of the states economy should be protected, especially from upcoming added regulations related to emission controls. She argued such added rules could further drive up costs for and industry already struggling under challenging market conditions. It seems to me there is some good to looking at these regulations. But perhaps the timing isnt right. Maybe we should take a pause on that with concern to the revenue needed from oil and gas production, Kernan said. I surmise that maybe all of this is going to have a huge impact on our economy and our revenue while at the same time it might not make a big impact with regard to the environment.

In the EIOs Short-Term Energy Outlook report published in February, the agency said the decline in total U.S. consumption reflects less natural gas consumed for electric power as a result of higher natural gas prices compared with last year. In 2021, EIA expects residential natural gas demand to average 12.9 Bcf per day and commercial demand to average 9.1 Bcf per day. EIA forecasts industrial consumption will average 23.0 Bcf per day in 2021 as a result of increased manufacturing activity amid a recovering economy. Industrial consumption of 23.0 Bcf per day would be 0.1 Bcf per day below the 2019 level. EIA expects total U.S. natural gas consumption will average 81.0 Bcf per day in 2022. Overall, the EIO says the energy sectors short-term forecast remains subject to heightened levels of uncertainty because responses to COVID-19 continue to evolve. Reduced economic activity related to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in energy demand and supply over the past year and will continue to affect these patterns in the future, the report reads. Benjamin Sullivan, co-president of the Gas and Oil Association of West Virginia (GO-WV), said the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the important role the oil and gas industry plays in everyday lives of average citizens. Our field workers  our frontline workers  are really providing an essential service, he said. They were out there keeping peoples heat on, keeping natural gas flowing to power plants to produce electricity, fuel for vehicles and fuel for cooking and heating. Natural gas and petroleum products provide the feedstocks for countless products, including those of vital importance during a crisis like a pandemic, Sullivan said. Its thousands of everyday items, including PPE, pharmaceuticals and other national security items, he said. So we feel like the pandemic has allowed us to show that were a very viable part of the community. We care about the communities were in and we didnt stop during the pandemic and we hope to be part of the solution going forward with help from our elected officials and others. Oil and gas prices were very bad throughout 2020, Sullivan said. In 2020, pricing was historically bad and the industry suffered, not just in West Virginia but all over the country, he said. The severance tax income from the oil and gas sector, as well as the coal sector, was down substantially in 2020 versus 2019. However, prices are starting to gradually trend upwards, Sullivan said. The good news is, theres been a bit of an uptick in price. Its still not where it was in 2019 and its still very, very low, but when we look at pricing the first few months into this year and project it across the rest of the year, its going to be a little bit up from 2020, he said. 2022 is looking better, still not a huge increase, but certainly much better than we saw last year. Charlie Burd, executive director of GO-WV, said West Virginias oil and gas industry remains focused on growth and adaptation. We havent changed too much from where we were at the end of 2020, he said. Funding for plugging orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells remains among the industrys biggest concerns, Burd said. In 2020, the West Virginia Legislature passed legislation that allows for expedited oil and gas well permitting upon payment of applicable fees. These fees go into a fund that pays for well reclamation projects throughout the state, Burd said. Weve had a year or so of regulations passed that did things like provide funding for orphaned and abandoned wells, he said. That is in place now, and those funds should be getting populated now with cash because the severance taxes are being submitted. According to a study published by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission that looked at idle wells in 30 states and five Canadian provinces, 28 states and provinces have wells approved to remain in idle status, with most having between 100 and 10,000. The total number of approved idle wells is 294,743, which is 15.6% of the total number of documented wells that have been drilled and not plugged. Orphaned wells are idle wells for which the operator is unknown or insolvent. Most states and provinces have inventories of documented orphan wells and prioritize orphan wells for plugging according to risk. According to IOGCCs findings, there are currently at least 4,646 orphaned wells in West Virginia. An additional 9,000 orphaned wells are estimated to exist, but are not documented. The latest count of West Virginias active drilling rigs shows increased activity in the state, Burd said. The latest rig count has us up to 12 rigs  last year at this time we were at eight, he said. The rig count is up and that is always a good sign. Industry stakeholders remain watchful of the Biden administration as its rolls out its energy policies, Burd said. We wait with anticipation with what will happen in the future. Obviously the administration in D.C. has changed and we are now beginning to see the effects of some of the executive orders that were executed that have changed the way oil and gas were operating, he said. The Keystone XL pipeline and some of the activities on emissions and methane, it remains to be seen exactly how they will play out. But certainly we will learn to operate within the frame work of the regulatory guidelines and we will do what weve always done. We will persevere and we will continue to produce energy for our state and our nation. White House leadership may have changed, but West Virginias senators remain committed to protecting its energy industries, Burd said. Senators Manchin and Capito are veteran legislators and certainly understand the importance of fossil fuel development in the state of West Virginia and how that impacts the entire country, he said. Having Sen. Manchin at the top of the Senate Energy Committee is a very big plus for the state of West Virginia. Manchin has expressed his support for an all of the above energy strategy that embraces a diversified energy production portfolio, Burd said. He wants to look at all energy forms, but as a former governor he understands the significance of fossil fuel development, he said. He views the goal of phasing out fossil fuels in the coming decades as unlikely, Burd said. We all have to recognize that the dynamic of producing and using energy in our country and in our world is changing, but a radical shift from fossil fuels virtually overnight is not as realistic as some may think, he said.

New Energy Secretarys clean energy goal worries oil and gas industry advocates  FOX 46 Charlotte,fox46,"Mar 07, 2021",2021-03-07 14:21:08,"West Texas Republican Congressman Jodey Arrington, whose district produces a large portion of the states energy, says the transition will hurt these industries and the millions of Americans it employs. Mar 7, 2021 / 09:21 AM EST / Updated: Mar 7, 2021 / 09:21 AM EST WASHINGTON, D.C. (Nexstar)  Less than a week after she was sworn in as Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm is already putting her clean energy plan into play. She says shed like to get to a zero-carbon world by 2050  and that means cutting back on fossil fuel and focusing on clean energy sources. But what does this mean for the oil and gas industry? West Texas Republican Congressman Jodey Arrington, whose district produces a large portion of the states energy, says the transition will hurt these industries and the millions of Americans it employs. It is not going to just have a crushing effect on our economy, it will compromise our energy independence, which is a national security issue, said Arrington. But Granholm says the department plans to work with the oil industry as they transition to clean energy and says no worker will be left behind. These technologies when deployed will create millions of good paying jobs for people in every pocket of the country, she said. Granholm says the plan is to help those workers translate their skills to fit the new technologies. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

116,Oil and gas execs 'guardedly optimistic' about future of industry,currentargus,"Mar 07, 2021",2021-03-07 07:07:00,"Industry leaders were optimistic amid a struggling fossil fuel market and talks of a statewide transition to renewable energy. View Comments Oil and gas executives at some of New Mexicos top operators said they were optimistic for the future of the industry, even during a market downturn led by the COVID-19 pandemic and talks of a national and statewide transition to renewable energy. The comments came during the New Mexico Oil and Gas Associations (NMOGA) annual member meeting held Thursday via a webinar. NMOGA Executive Director Ryan Flynn said the industry was well positioned to continue providing energy and hydrocarbon-based products like plastics to the world for years to come. More: Federal government looks to open up dunes sagebrush lizard habitat to oil and gas He also pointed to the industrys contributions to state funds in New Mexico, as about $3 billion or 39 percent of the states budget came directly from oil and gas last year. That meant $1.4 billion for public schools and other educational institutions. Since the pandemic hit and revenue from oil and gas slowed, the state faced a $400 million funding shortfall lawmakers will have to balance at the upcoming legislative session, meaning cuts to education spending such as teacher raises, and universal childcare could be cut. We provide something that is necessary and essential to each and every person. Not only have we stood tall, we stood with the state of New Mexico, Flynn said. Thanks to the oil and gas industry, were showing whats possible in New Mexico when you invest in our industry. We stood tall in the face of adversity. More: And despite calls to reduce New Mexicos reliance on carbon-based energy, Flynn said the fossil fuel industry would continue to be a major player in reducing carbon emissions and developing more environmentally-friendly technology. He was certain oil and gas would remain relevant in New Mexico for the foreseeable future. Weve also managed to see record-breaking production despite the challenges. While our success from a production standpoint stands out, its our efforts to position our industry to be successful in the future, Flynn said. Were not shying away from the climate change conversation. We will be part of a low-carbon future. More: Permian Basin leading oil and gas' recovery, could be strained by 2nd COVID-19 wave David Hager, chief executive officer of Devon Energy addressed the companys recent merger with WPX Energy to reduce operational costs while continuing to produce oil and natural gas in the Permian Basin. He said consolidations like the $12 billion deal represented a future for the industry that emphasizes strong returns for shareholders instead of growth in production. While this market trend was escalated by the pandemic and declines in the market, Hager said it was a shareholder desire before COVID-19 hit. More: Here are the 7 oil and gas operators being sued by the New Mexico State Land Office Even before the pandemic hit, there were already waves of change in our industry moving toward less emphasis on production growth and more on getting good returns for shareholders, he said. This is what the industry needed. There were waves of change in the industry, and the pandemic accelerated it. And once a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed and the health crisis subsides, Hager said he expected the industry will return to the prominence it experienced during a record-breaking boom in 2019. Im guardedly optimistic. I think that once we get a vaccine and get past this pandemic, well see more disciplined cashflow from the industry, he said. Were continuing to involve and improve. I think the future is much brighter than some may have painted in the recent past. More: New Mexico's oil and gas regulators cut budgets amid COVID-19, downturn in fuel markets Rick Muncrief, CEO of WPX said the transition to renewables and low-carbon energy presented opportunities for oil and gas and could increase the need for plastics created with fossil fuels like petroleum. Well continue to do a much better job there. But we also need to step back and see what the opportunities in the transition space are. There will still be hydrocarbons that people need all over the world, he said. I would hate to fight this pandemic without plastics. Lets make sure we communicate very clearly the amount of hydrocarbons it takes to produce renewable energy. We are still going to be tasked as an oil and gas industry to meet societys demands even during this transition. More: BLM: Oil and gas land sale moves forward in New Mexico amid calls to ban federal leasing David Adams, senior vice president at Haliburton also saw a future for oil and gas during the shift to renewables, in developing new technologies in automating and digitizing operations to maintain the viability of the industry. Even though were going through and energy transition, the oil and gas industry is going to be here for years to come. We need to get away from this fear that oil and gas is just going to go away, Adams said. Were going to continue to invest in technology, regardless of what the market throws our way.

117,"Letters: Oil and gas industry, death penalty",dispatch,"Mar 07, 2021",2021-03-07 06:30:00,"Letters to the Editor Letters: Oil and gas industry, death penalty Letters to the Editor Report was wrong: Oil, gas industry in Ohio is boon for jobs, energy costs The Ohio River Valley Institutes recent report attempting to discredit the many economic benefits that oil and natural gas drilling provide for our state missed the mark. In reality, this industry has been a great benefit and integral component to Ohios economy and the entire Appalachian region. The natural gas and oil industry is responsible for nearly 205,000 jobs in Ohio, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. Shale-related employmentsuch as drilling and pipeline construction for examplehas increased more than 90% since 2011, with annual wages averaging between $70,000 and $80,000, far higher than the state average. Beyond the obvious benefits of job creation, the abundance of natural gas also has helped lower energy costs for Ohio families. A study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that natural gas prices for the average household were $429 lower in 2018 than in 2008. Furthermore, the average price of gasoline in 2008 was $4.10 per gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration. Last year, gasoline was $1.96 per gallon. Think of what these savings mean, especially for average- and low-income Ohioans. The developments made by this industry over the past 10 years have created hundreds of thousands of jobs, lowered energy prices and made the United States more energy independent, so we are buying fuel from Ohioans and other Americans. Ohios natural gas and oil industry is an integral part of this progress, and I am proud to support the hard-working Americans who provide us energy and fuel our way of life. Tim Schaffer State Senator, 20th District Staying vigilant, getting COVID-19 vaccine more important than ever States are loosening public health measures (masking and social restrictions) at the wrong time, falsely reassured by decreasing numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Yet these numbers should make us take pause. For example, in March 2020, the average worldwide daily death rate from COVID-19 was around 400, versus nearly 6,000 today. In America, daily COVID-19 cases are nearly at the peak of the first surge (50,000 cases per day). Finally, less than 15% of the U.S. population has received the second dose of the vaccines. Therefore, the pandemic is far from over and herd immunity is not yet achieved. Getting vaccinated stops the spread of the virus, protects against getting severe COVID-19 and decreases induction of viral variants. Viral variants result from the virus replicating in high numbers and in so doing acquiring mutations in its genetic profile, which confer a survival advantage to the virus and, in some cases, increase its virulence and transmission among people. These viral variants can decrease vaccine efficacy, as exemplified by the South Africa variant. As a result, second-generation vaccines are being developed as a likely need to combat variant emergence, virulence and infectivity. Breaking the cycle of spreading virus and emerging variants requires three things: adherence to public health measures, universal vaccination among both resource-rich and poor countries, and public education and consistent messaging. The latter is essential for addressing both vaccine hesitancy and impressing upon the public its central role in stopping the pandemic. The vaccines work only if you get them  and more than 515,000 deaths in America should serve as a reminder to do so. Jeffery J. Auletta, M.D., Dublin Death penalty is immoral killing; Ohio should ban executions Whether on a city street or in a Chillicothe prison, killing is wrong. The public is right to be outraged over horrific acts that destroy the lives of our fellow citizens, neighbors and public servants. Families of murdered persons are often called co-victims, a label I now wear after the 1997 murder of my sister in Cleveland. We are justified in harboring feelings of rage over the killing of our loved ones. Our sentiments are reactions to the calculated, unethical and immoral decision-making that drove other humans to engage in acts that ended the lives of our family and community members. I also am a Christian who believes that whether a life-ending act occurs on a Cleveland street or in a Chillicothe prison authorized by the state, killing is wrong. Jesus was once asked to authorize the execution of an adulterous woman.  Interestingly, her male counterpart was not condemned, a sign of bias in the ethically bankrupt execution business. When Jesus told the womans all-male jurors that they could stone her only if they themselves were sinless, the non-sin-free jurors retreated. Sparked by love and justice, Jesus disrupted an execution and redeemed a life destined to be discarded. People can change. Consider Moses, David, and Paul, biblical leaders with murder on their resumes. God transformed them into legendary faith leaders. The cycle of calculated, unethical and immoral acts that lead to neighborhood homicides is not stopped by the states own calculated, unethical and immoral homicidal acts called executions. Instead, executions erode the states moral credibility. Lets make Ohio the 24th state to abolish the death penalty. Rev. Dr. Jack Sullivan, Jr., Canal Winchester In bill to repeal death penalty, murderers, not victims, are served I have read story after story in the Dispatch recently about how the lives of murderers should be spared the death penalty at all costs. Politician after politician has been quoted extolling why these convicted murderers should not face justice. You are printing opinion polls saying Ohioans are against the death penalty. Well, no one has asked me. No one has asked the victims' families, the judges, the juries, the prosecutors. These are the people who heard the evidence and found these death-row murderers guilty. Certainly no one has asked the totally forgotten and discarded victims. How dare the politicians who have been elected to uphold the law overlook the victims of crime and their families. It matters when a murderer is found guilty and given the death penalty. It matters that the victim's life was valued and that the perpetrator will pay the ultimate price. Sen. Steve Huffman (R-Tipp City) was quoted as saying ""Human life is precious,"" referring to his support for ending the death penalty. Apparently, murder victims' lives are not precious to Huffman. I hope the next story I read is that a recently proposed bill to end executions in Ohio has failed.

Sankofas Gas: energy independence as a basis for economic diversification Gas already represents half of Enis global production miX Sat,  6 Mar 2021 Giuseppe Valenti Over the 64 years since Independence, Ghana has made great strides towards economic independence  a goal whose relevance is all too clear since Covid-19 disrupted everybodys lives, affecting every activity  and the energy industry  with a magnitude that exceeded all recent crises. The pandemic led us  individuals as much as companies  to a deep reckoning of our priorities and our goals. At Eni, we decided to accelerate our transformation as an energy company, and we committed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050  and one of the main levers to get there is leveraging natural gas. Gas already represents half of Enis global production mix, and it will rise over the coming years to reach 55% in 2025 and as much as 90% in 2050. Although gas is still a fossil fuel this natural resource is uniquely placed to facilitate the transition from the current intensive use of carbon to a low-carbon future. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently predicted that gas will be the fastest-growing source of energy over the next two decades, second only to solar power. Most importantly, natural gas is a cleaner energy source: it has the lowest carbon footprint of all fossil fuels, generating about half the CO2 emissions of coal per kWh of electricity generated. This means that gas can play a crucial role in one of the worlds greatest challenges: tackling climate change, while also ensuring access to energy for a growing population, with the aim of fostering development and reducing social and economic imbalances. One of the pillars of Enis business model is the pursuit of this transition by promoting the development of local markets. This is the strategic framework behind the Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP) project, the only deep water non-associated gas project dedicated to domestic consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa, operated by Eni on behalf of its partners Vitol and GNPC. OCTP is an integrated project: it has been designed in such a way to exploit both oil and gas found in the subsurface and most importantly to be at zero flaring in order to reduce emissions from production at a minimum. The Sankofa field gas, which forms part of the OCTP project, benefits Ghana in multiple ways: it allows for environmental benefits, triggers local development, reduces the Countrys energy cost and provides stability in price and supply. Since 2018, Sankofa gas has been powering Ghanas economy through stable supply of electricity. Furthermore, thanks to Enis role in completing the Takoradi-Tema Interconnection Project in 2019, gas has flowed smoothly from the Western Region for use by off-takers in the Tema-Accra power and industrial enclave. Sankofa gas has allowed Ghana to eliminate the Countrys previous dependence on imported liquid fuels, which are not only more expensive but also more polluting. From 2017 to date the use of liquid fuel has been practically eliminated: in 2020, 98% of Ghanas thermal power was generated by gas of which more than 50% comes from OCTP. COVID 19 has taught all of us about the importance of developing domestic resources for sustained economic development and energy independence in the wake of a pandemic. Sankofa alone can deliver significantly higher gas rates to meet Ghanas needs along with its economic growth. In addition to currently producing fields, Ghana has significant additional gas resources that could be developed: with the right policy framework and looking to the current situation in terms of power sector in its neighboring countries, Ghana may consider increasing its ability to export electricity. The future exploration activity that Eni is looking to perform in the country supports this course: a viable research of new fields that can be brought online in a timely and sustainable way, just as was done for Sankofa. An optimized utilization of fossil resources like oil and gas, while looking into alternative sources of energy like solar power, can play a pivotal role in the economic independence of Ghana, paving the way for other sustainable energy sources that can integrate and, in time, substitute traditional fossil fuels visioning toward a full circular economy. Under Enis dual flag approach, there is a huge opportunity for Ghana and Eni to combine efforts to efficiently exploit domestic gas resources for accelerated growth of the economy, to the benefit of all Ghanaians.

119,Biden team gives oil executives hard sell on energy transition,houstonchronicle,"Mar 05, 2021",2021-03-05 14:30:00,"One after another, top officials from the Biden administration popped up on oil and gas... of 3 Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry was among the top Biden administration officials who appeared at the annual CERAWeek by IHS Markit conference to pitch the oil and gas industry on the administrations climate policies. Evan Vucci, STF / Associated Press Show Less One after another, top officials from the Biden administration popped up on oil and gas executives screens this week, extolling the tremendous opportunity that climate change presents. Their stage was the annual CERAWeek by IHS Markit conference  held virtually this year, but still a see and be-seen event that attracted the biggest names in the energy industry. And not unlike officials from foreign nations who show up each year to sell executives on exciting new oil or gas fields, Biden administration officials were trying to convince attendees that technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen energy mean there is a place for oil and gas companies in the administrations plans for a clean energy future. Its a heck of an economic opportunity, promised Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. John Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, told the virtual audience, I don't object to fossil fuels. I object to the byproducts, specifically greenhouse gases. On HoustonChronicle.com: Kerry bullish on clean energy investment, calling it 'unprecedented' The road show approach by the Biden administration marks the early stages of a generational effort to transform the U.S. economy, to virtually eliminate the greenhouse gas emissions that largely come from the burning of oil and other fossil fuels by mid-century. On the campaign trail, now President Joe Biden said the United States needed to transition away from oil. But with the world getting about 80 percent of its energy through oil, natural gas and coal, the thinking is that not only will fossil fuels be around for a while yet, but the expertise oil and gas companies have built up over the past century will be essential in developing clean energy technologies such as geothermal and offshore wind, bringing them to a commercial scale and ultimately reducing emissions. Dan Yergin, the energy historian who hosts CERAWeek each year, likened the Biden administrations outreach to a meet and greet, but on a very significant scale. Energy transitions normally take centuries, and to try and do it in three decades is a very tall task, he said. This (week) is a recognition of reality for all the participants. Theres not been much dialogue up until now. Kerry was scheduled to meet with oil executives Thursday, Yergin said. And throughout the week's conference, there were signs that the Biden teams message was being relatively well received. CEOs from companies including Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil have come under increasing pressure from investors to adapt their businesses and deal with climate change. During appearances at CERAWeek this week, they eagerly talked up efforts to develop clean energy technologies, while acknowledging their efforts were still early stages and much work was left to be done. Frankly, to do the job thats required to help society get to net-zero, were going to need more advances, said Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods. Weve been doing a lot of work trying to find technologies that allow us to move down that cost curve. On HoustonChronicle.com: Activist climate investors pose new threat to oil companies After years of back and forth between the industry and government officials over the role of oil and gas in society, executives at large oil and gas companies have started to come around on the need to decarbonize their industry if they are to survive in the decades ahead. We start from the same place, Aaron Padilla, manager of climate policy at the American Petroleum Institute, the industrys largest trade group, said of the Biden teams outreach. Our industry and our companies have a long history of innovation and a significantly well-rounded set of expertise that they are bringing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Already, refining companies such as Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum have begun shifting into low-carbon biofuels made from used cooking oil or tree trimmings to reduce their carbon footprints and take advantage of lucrative low-carbon fuel incentives in California and other states. Oil and natural gas producers are expected to make similar shifts. Hydrogen, which is traditionally made from natural gas, is at the top of many experts lists as new lines of business for oil and gas companies, presuming they can figure out how to capture the carbon emissions from that process economically. Likewise, there is renewed interest among oil executives in geothermal energy, which would employ the industrys drilling expertise to burrow deep underground and use the heat of the planets inner core to boil water and generate electricity  like a subterranean power plant. Earlier this week, Chevron announced it was investing with the geothermal-focused investment firm Baseload Capital in Sweden, toward developing pilot projects in Iceland, Japan and the United States. More: Read the latest oil and gas news from HoustonChronicle.com And then there is the prospect of capturing carbon from burning natural gas and other fossil fuels to produce materials like carbon fiber, which can be used in manufacturing products such as tires and boats. It really comes down to the commercial process, what does it cost. Thats where a lot of research and development is being focused by players in the oil and gas industry, said Ken Medlock, an energy professor at Rice University. If you can take the existing asset base and move it one step further in terms of how we refine the commodity in order to reduce emissions, you preserve the asset base. Oil and gas are expected to play a significant role in global energy for at least the next two decades. The International Energy Agency, which advises nations on energy, estimates that even if the world achieves the goals of the Paris climate accord, oil and gas would still account for almost 50 percent of the worlds energy supply in 2040  a sharp drop from todays 80 percent, but still a massive industry. The hope among world leaders is that by mid-century companies such as Exxon and BP will have found a way to not only produce oil and gas free of carbon emissions, but also have developed other energy businesses. During his talk this week, Kerry asked the question: The oil and gas industry has incredible capacity to move oil and gas from one place to the other. What if that happened with hydrogen? Right now, producing hydrogen without carbon emissions costs about five times as much as producing oil, according to analysis by IHS Markit. But with the oil and gas industry expected to invest $5 billion to $10 billion in the technology over the next five years, the expectation is that costs will come down significantly. If anyone is going to make it work, Medlock said, its the oil and gas industry. james.osbo",https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Biden-team-gives-oil-executives-hard-sell-on-16003020.php

Photographed in Houston on Thursday, March 4, 2021. Elizabeth Conley, Houston Chronicle / Staff photographer Show Less Emily Malucci had been saving her pennies for a rainy day. Shed put a portion of every paycheck away for more than a year before being laid off from her job as a field engineer at Stingray Pressure Pumping in August 2019. The pandemic and resulting recession lengthened her search for a job in the energy industry from weeks to months to a year and a half. Her savings? It just wasnt enough. The oil and gas industry has been pummeled by the pandemic as efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus keep people at home. The decline in demand for crude led oil companies in 2020 to slash an estimated 107,000 jobs. In Texas, nearly 60,000 oil exploration and production jobs were lost last year. President Joe Biden, aiming to slow the effects of climate change, has pledged to put the U.S. on a path to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a plan that would further shrink the fossil fuel industry and eliminate more oil and gas jobs. Bidens January executive order canceling the Keystone XL pipeline eliminated an estimated 11,000 jobs. Although industry expertssay most were temporary positions, the economic effects remain. The presidents plans would create more jobs in clean energy than the jobs that might be sacrificed, Energy Secretary said during her Senate confirmation hearing in January. Experts are skeptical, however, saying that the number of new jobs wont be enough to employ displaced oil and gas workers caught in the transition. SLOW RETURN: Thousands of oil-field services jobs added in January Moreover, automobile manufacturers have pledged to stop making vehicles that run on gas, with the era of electric cars quickly dawning. GM has said it will stop making gasoline-powered passenger cars, vans and sport utility vehicles by 2035. Oil and gas is not the first industry to see such disarray. Market and political forces have reshaped industries such as steel, manufacturing and timber, all resulting in massive job losses. The U.S. has been here before. As for the future, the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst has predicted that the oil industry will contract by 20 percent in the next decade and by 95 percent from 2031 to 2050. The natural gas industry isnt expected to see a decline until 2030, but then it could shrink by 75 percent by 2050, according to the institute. The idea of cleaner sources of energy sounds great, unless you are one of the workers who has lost your job in the industry transition. It is an important issue that needs to be addressed, said Kenneth Medlock, senior director at the Center for Energy Studies at the Baker Institute at Rice University. It is critical that, to the extent policy is going to take steps to make sure the energy system is cleaner and greener as we move forward, it addresses the people who are potentially left behind, said Medlock. Nobody wants to lack an opportunity because they spent their time learning how to do something that is being displaced. That includes Malucci. A struggle ever since The 26-year-old University of Tulsa graduate moved back to Houston from Oklahoma in January 2020. Now living with her parents, she questions her decision to get a degree in petrochemical engineering. The whole time I was in college, everyone said I would never struggle to find a job, Malucci said. But it has been a struggle ever since. With her career derailed, Malucci had to find an alternate way to make money. She began making beaded bracelets and selling them on Emgems Creations, which she launched on online marketplace Etsy in March 2020. TAKING ON THE PRESIDENT: Texas Republicans unite to accuse Biden of killing oil jobs Malucci has sold $10,000 worth of jewelry in the past eight months, significantly less than her $80,000 annual salary at Stingray. But, she says, the work is good for her morale. It was pretty hard for a while not being able to find a job. I was really down, Malucci said. So I became passionate about making bracelets for people. It has been good for me because it gives me purpose. It is something to wake up and do. Energy workers like Malucci have always been susceptible to the volatility of the fossil fuel industry. But the pandemic downturn coupled with the rapidly approaching transition to cleaner energy sources has raised the level of skepticism about the industrys ability to bounce back. Recipe for survival Daniel Meehan, 31, also had to get creative with his job path after he was laid off in May. The former Marathon Energy geologist started Alchemist Fire BBQ, a barbecue seasoning company, out of his Houston-area home in late November. Meehan made the switch after his months-long job search came up empty. I was looking for jobs in energy but there wasnt a lot, Meehan said. I even tried applying for sales jobs in the industry. Meehan began creating recipes for his seasoning blends for fun after his father bought him a backyard grill for Christmas in 2015. I went and bought a bunch of seasonings. Some were too sweet or not sweet enough, Meehan said. By 2019, I had replaced them all with my own blend. His hobby has now become a business venture. Alchemist Fire BBQ offers two proprietary mixes, with more on the way. Meehan, who made $121,000 a year at Marathon Energy, said he sells about $1,500 of product per month, netting half that amount. Fuel Fix: Get energy news sent directly to your inbox Meanwhile, he continues to apply for energy jobs though he isnt confident hell land one. Oil and gas may come back but green energy seems more long term, Meehan said. As a backup plan, he is pursuing an information technology certification that could open the door for a possible IT security career. Bad timing The transition to renewables also is bad news for geologist Scott Wessels, who believes the oil and gas business no longer holds a place for him. I dont think jobs for a geologist are going to come back, said Wessels, laid off from PetroEdge Resources. It has been nearly a year since I was let go. I have seen less than a dozen jobs posted and there are hundreds of applicants for each. Losing his job could not have come at a worse time for the 36-year-old Houston resident. Wessels and his wife had welcomed a baby just six months before. Not only was he left looking for ways to provide for his family, but he had to turn down an opportunity to enroll in the Master of Business Administration program at Rice University. I was accepted a few weeks after I was laid off. I couldnt afford to go, Wessels said. Instead, he started a power washing company, Tidy Wash, in August 2020. It was something I could learn quickly and start in a short amount of time on a low budget",https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Hope-smaller-incomes-sustain-Houston-s-former-16000821.php

CALGARY -- As the price of oil continues to climb, energy industry groups say we could be rounding the corner towards recovery. The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) climbed beyond US$64 per barrel at points on Thursday, up from US$45 a barrel in December. ""We are on the cusp of, hopefully, a recovery. Our economy nationally and provincially have taken a hit,"" said Tim McMillan, the president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). ""Currently prices are higher than what we would have expected last year."" The Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors (CAODC) says activity is about 35 per cent higher than initially forecast. ""All of this, of course, is a result of some growing optimism in the industry,"" said Mark Scholz with the CAODC. But both McMillan and Scholz add they are ""cautiously optimistic"" about continuing the momentum, pointing out there is still global volatility in the oil and gas sectors. Demand for natural resources is growing and supply globally remains somewhat low, some analysts say. On Thursday, the OPEC+ producer alliance decided to hold output steady. ""Here in Alberta, we're actually able to take advantage of that.,"" said Charles St-Arnaud, the chief economist for Alberta Central. ""Our oil production is back to pre-COVID levels so actually we're benefiting probably much more than other on the recent increase in oil prices."" Alberta's provincial budget, released on Feb. 25, forecasted WTI to hover around US$46/bbl for 2020-21.

122,Flow Oil and Gas Revenues to Cleantech R&D: Common Ground on Energy?,brookings,"Mar 05, 2021",2021-03-05 00:00:00,"Mark Muro discusses the potential for compromise in the administrations latest clean energy proposal, the Energy Security Trust fund, despite gridlock in Congress. Can Congress pass any sort of energy legislation?  Im not holding my breath. For too long now meaningful action through compromise has been a chimera.  Even the most plausible deals have been dissipated by ideological tribalism. Still, there remain potential convergence points. Last month the Bipartisan Policy Center advanced more than 50 middle-of-the-road energy policy recommendationsdeveloped by its Strategic Energy Policy Initiative co-chaired by former Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND) and former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS). And for that matter, interesting discussions surround energy efficiency issues, thoughtful subsidy reform, and steps like opening master limited partnership status to renewable energy projects. Now comes President Obamas modest proposalto capitalize an Energy Security Trust fund to support research into de-carbonizing the vehicle sector. To be funded with $2 billion over 10 years drawn from royalties the government receives from offshore drilling on the Outer Shelf, the new proposalfirst aired in Obamas State of the Union address last monthrepresents an important check point on the potential for constructive action through compromise in Congress. To be sure, the proposed research fund is tiny, given the scale of the nations cleantech research needs. And yes, its focused only on the transportation sector.  And yes, the proposal is quite vague and so hard to gauge. But even so, the energy trust concept represents a significant bid to test the potential for advancing energy policy. Research on clean energy technologies remains a critical priority.  Locating funding for it remains a critical challenge. And the presidents proposal probes an area of genuine potential for convergence. For one thing a modest bargain on energy research and oil and gas royalties has always had a sound intellectual grounding.  Through such an architecture the costs of investment would be internalized across the energy sector, and the revenues of dirty exploitation would be used to fund clean innovation. That just makes sense. Beyond that there is the fact that the concept has some authentic bipartisan lineage and maybe traction. Some of that comes from the support for the idea by a group of retired military and business leaders, including some Republicans, called Securing Americas Future Energy More importantly, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee, has proposed a similar idea(albeit one focused on drilling on lands now off-limits, such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska).  This convergence might well mean there is room to negotiate a deal that pleases both sides, especially with royalty growth likely in the coming years. Or, maybe not. Perhaps the Energy Security Trust is just another illusion of plausible potential compromise, soon to evaporate. Yet, there is encouragement in something called the American Energy Act, the 2009 energy plan introduced by House Republicans under the leadership of Rep. John Boehner, now speaker of the House.  At the center of that plan was a proposed bargain that would have paired expanded oil and gas drilling and nuclear development with new investments in renewable and alternative energy.  To fund the latter the bill proposed putting hundreds of billions of anticipated new oil and gas royalties into a trust fund to accelerate clean energy innovation.  Sound familiar?

Jewesimi, in an interview with the Nigerian Tribune on the best practices in the nations oil and gas sector, noted that while the exploitation of oil and gas reserves had not been without some ecological side effects including oil spills, and air and water pollution, drilling fluids and drill cuttings remained the largest waste streams generated in global drilling operations and called on the Nigerian regulators of the industry to ensure minimal damage is done to the environment and protect marine life offshore as these protections are not limited to Nigeria; most oil and gas countries have similar legislation and regulations to protect the environment. The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), is the regulator of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. The Environmental Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum Industry in Nigeria, EGASPIN, outlines environmental and safety standards that must be complied with by oil operators. The DPR evaluates and monitors the discharges into the environment from exploration, production, terminal operations, hydrocarbon processing, oil transportation, and marketing operations. Since 1991, the EGASPIN has been updated and revised to be at par with international best practices and advancements in drilling waste management technology, including zero discharge for inland and offshore shallow waters, he noted. Jewesimi added that in the zero-discharge zones, discharge is prohibited of whole and spent drilling fluid, drill cuttings, deck drainage, and well treatment waste. Discharges are permitted where the distance from the shoreline is greater than 12 nautical miles or the water depth greater than 200 feet under certain conditions. Water-based drilling fluids and cuttings discharge is allowed if the fluid and cuttings pass the sheen test and discharge is approved by DPR. Speaking on the regulation of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria, compared with other African countries, he lamented that some of the newer oil-producing countries in West Africa do not have regulations. In those countries, operator discretion and corporate global standards drive the present practices, adding that with the introduction of non-aqueous drilling fluids offshore, regulations have become more stringent, prompting the industry to come up with new technology that enhances the efficiency of solids-removal equipment. Jewesimi, however, expressed optimism that the future of the Nigerian oil and gas is bright as the drilling industry has already made lots of progress with the development of new drilling fluid systems that are more environmentally friendly, adding that the use of diesel-based mud had been stopped offshore and greatly reduced onshore. The industry will continue to engage with regulators and industry stakeholders to create awareness on best practices and develop and implement new technology to move the industry in the direction of greater safety and protection of the environment, he assured.

GBA,oedigital,"Mar 11, 2021",2021-03-11 09:29:37,"Jersey Oil & Gas, a UK-based company working to develop an oil and gas production hub at the Greater Buchan Area in the UK North Sea Jersey Oil & Gas in Fundraising Talks. GBA Farm-out Process Formally Launched March 11, 2021 Credit: GBA Concept - Credit: JOG Jersey Oil & Gas, a UK-based company working to develop an oil and gas production hub at the Greater Buchan Area in the UK North Sea, said Thursday it was in talks to raise funds to progress work on the project. The company said it was responding to media speculation regarding ""the company potentially undertaking an equity fundraise."" ""The company confirms that it is in discussions regarding a fundraising of between 10 to 15 million,"" JOG said, adding that there can be no certainty that any funds will be raised by the company. JOG on March 3 announced the concept selection for the Greater Buchan Area project with Phase 1 including a single integrated wellhead, production, utilities, and quarters (WPUQ) Platform located at the Buchan field. The company at the time said it would launch a farm-out process ahead of the final investment decision expected in 2022. It on Thursday said that the planned farm-out process has now been formally launched. Also, regarding the potential fundraise, JOG said: ""The net proceeds of such a potential fundraise would be utilized to maintain momentum for the next phase of workstreams on the project and augment the company's existing cash reserves during farm-out discussions."" As previously reported the GBA development concept is based on P50 Technically Recoverable Resource estimates of, in aggregate, 172 MMboe of light sweet crude and associated gas within the Core GBA, which includes the Buchan oil field and J2 and Verbier oil discoveries. The development is planned to be executed in three phases, Jersey Oil and Gas said. Production from the reservoirs will be supported by injection of both produced water and seawater. The Phase 1 facility will be normally manned. The Buchan wells are planned to be drilled using a heavy-duty jack-up (HDJU) located over a 12 slot well bay. The Phase 1 facilities will be designed to accommodate Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the development. CAPEX costs for Phase 1 are estimated to be approximately 1 billion. Phase 2 will develop the J2 West, J2 East, and Verbier East discoveries via a subsea tie-back to the GBA platform. Phase 3 will develop the Verbier West discovery via connection to the Phase 2 subsea infrastructure. Field life is anticipated to be 31 years. JOG is looking to produce first oil from the first phase in Q4 2025. The second phase startup would follow in 2027, and Phase 3 in 2028. The facilities will be powered from shore. JOG has said that its power from shore solution for the GBA Development Project is still economically attractive, despite a 'Green Premium' compared to the conventional case utilizing gas turbines. ""The costs associated with the provision of a subsea cable and grid connection outweigh the cost reductions associated with the removal of gas turbines and associated utility systems, resulting in a CAPEX increase of approximately 80 million,"" JOG said earlier this month.

Bloomberg Saudi Wealth Fund Raises Years Third-Biggest Loan for New Deals (Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabias sovereign wealth fund obtained the third-biggest loan of the year so far as it raises money for new investments.The Public investment Fund signed the $15 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with 17 banks from Asia, the Middle East, Europe, the U.K. and the U.S., according to a statement on Wednesday. The loan provides PIF with access to additional capital that can be deployed at speed when convenient, it said.The facility is the biggest loan the PIF has ever secured. This year its behind only Verizon Communications Inc.s $25 billion deal signed last month and a $24 billion loan announced by AerCap Holdings NV on Wednesday. The fund more than doubled the size of the amount it was planning to raise after initially targeting up to $7 billion, Bloomberg reported last month.The $400 billion sovereign investor is key to the kingdoms efforts to revive economic growth after a recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to stabilize oil prices with output cuts by an alliance of producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia. Handed $40 billion earlier this year to buy global stocks, the PIF plans to plow the same amount into the domestic economy this year and again in 2022.The fund has also received cash injections in the form of the $30 billion proceeds from the sale of shares in Saudi Aramco.The PIF is funded through a mixture of borrowing, cash and asset transfers from the government, and retained earnings from its investments. Chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and managed by Governor Yasir Al Rumayyan, the fund has outlined a plan to grow its assets to over 4 trillion riyals ($1.1 trillion) by 2025.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 4h ago Taiwan Probe Spurs Fears of China Poaching Top Chip Talent (Bloomberg) -- An investigation into illegal talent poaching by Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies Ltd. has revived fears Chinese companies will target Taiwans top engineers as their country works to build a world-class chipmaking industry.Investigators descended on the offices of Bitmains two Taiwan units and interviewed 19 people Tuesday in a probe into whether the crypto-mining startup had violated local laws, according to Chang Jui-chuan, a spokeswoman for the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office. The Chinese firm, which develops semiconductors for mining and other purposes, is suspected of illegally recruiting hundreds of engineers from Taiwanese firms over a period of three years. Taiwan prohibits firms from China from doing business or recruiting locally without prior approval, a measure intended to limit the influence of its political rival.The accusations against Bitmain spur concerns that Chinese firms will accelerate efforts to hire away Taiwans best engineers in a bid to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency. Beijing has pledged to develop its own advanced chip manufacturing in order to dominate future technologies and cut its dependence on $300 billion of annual semiconductor imports.Read more: China to Pour More Money Into Chips, AI and 5G to Catch U.S.Taiwans deep pool of expertise revolves around Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the worlds leading chip fabricator and a supplier to most American tech giants from Apple Inc. to Nvidia Corp. U.S. and European companies like Alphabet Inc.s Google and ASML Holding NV have set up engineering hubs and research bases to tap local talent.Chinas poaching of Taiwanese engineers undermines Taiwans semiconductor industry, said Carol Lin, a law professor at the Hsinchu-based National Chiao Tung University, which is now part of the newly formed National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. Through the maneuver, Chinese competitors can learn about Taiwan companies progress. If these engineers bring trade secrets with them, Chinese rivals can have a firm grasp of Taiwan companies past success and failure in technological developments, and this could result in unfair competition and even endanger national security.Beijing has denied Washingtons claims that it demands technology or talent transfers or targets the intellectual property of overseas firms. Bitmain representatives didnt respond to multiple requests for comment.Read more: The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for SemiconductorsBitmains actions are suspected of breaching Taiwans Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Chang said. An article in the act stipulates that for-profit Chinese firms cannot set up units in Taiwan and conduct business activities -- including headhunting -- without approval from Taiwanese authorities, she added.A separate press statement from Changs office, while not identifying Bitmain by name, shed light on the allegations. In order to develop artificial intelligence chips, the Chinese startup created a new entity in China with a Taiwanese engineer as chairman. This engineer then recruited colleagues from his former company in Taiwan and formed a headhunting team to set up a research and development center in Taiwan, according to the statement. Chang confirmed the company in the press release was Bitmain.The team offered potential recruits double their existing salaries and advertised openly on Taiwanese job sites, the prosecutors said. The countrys top chip designer MediaTek Inc., a major rival to Qualcomm Inc., was affected by Bitmains recruitment drive, Taiwans Apple Daily reported. A MediaTek representative declined to comment.Taiwanese executives have accused Chinese rivals of aggressive poaching for years. In 2018, Taiwanese DRAM maker Nanya Technology Corp. President Lee Pei-ing said some of his engineers were being offered three to five times their current salaries by Chinese competitors. The typical practice was to first lure away a manager who would then go on to recruit more of his former colleagues, according to Lee.Beyond talent poaching, global firms with operations in Taiwan and local officials have accused Chinese companies of technology theft. In 2019, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted five people for leaking tech belonging to German chemical maker BASF SE to Jiangyin Jianghua Microelectronics Materials Co., while Micron Technology Inc. has sued Taiwans United Microelectronics Corp. and its Chinese partner Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. for stealing trade secrets.

Comments Elizabeth Conley, Houston Chronicle / Staff photographer Texas reliance on the oil and gas industry could jeopardize up to $29 billion in public school funding over the next 15 years, according to a new study by two nonprofit policy groups. The report released Wednesday by the Center for Houstons Future and Texas 2036, analyzed the impact of declining oil- and gas-related revenue under various scenarios over the next decade and a half, when the Lone Star State will celebrate its bicentennial. The analysis calls attention to the states complex, difficult-to-forecast and increasingly at-risk method of funding public schools with gas and oil revenue  a strategy that is susceptible to the market swings that caused 60,000 Texas oil and gas job losses in 2020 Most people would be surprised to learn that K-12 education in Texas is affected by world oil prices, said Brett Perlman, the CEO of the Center for Houstons Future, which conducted the study. That would be a surprise to people. But when you start to look at this in more detail, what you find is that there is quite a significant link. And so what happens over the next 15 years in world oil prices is going to matter a lot to the state of Texas. Researchers said the recent power outages across the state and the coronavirus pandemic underscore the need to prepare for seemingly unthinkable and devastating scenarios. State officials and policymakers would do well to begin planning today for the possibility that the economic role that oil and gas plays in the state of Texas might be significantly different in the future, the report said. RELATED: Texas 2036 founder says planning for Texas' future can't wait In 2019, the oil exploration and production industry contributed about $13.5 billion in revenue to state funds. That year, about $6 billion in public school funding could be linked to the oil and gas industry, either through property taxe collections or other revenue  about 20 percent of total expenditures for K-12 schools, according to the analysis. The states Permanent School Fund, a more than $46 billion endowment, is also tied directly to the success of oil exploration, as it is funded solely by the industrys returns. If we live in a world where we do have low oil prices over a sustained period of time, the impacts could be quite large, Perlman said. BROKEN TRUST: Read the our investigation of diminishing returns for the Permanent School Fund The study evaluated the potential consequences of price drops using three low-but-plausible scenarios, compared to a constant pricing of $60 a barrel, roughly the current rate. The three scenarios included one in which oil prices drop steadily over the next 15 years to $30 a barrel; one in which the industry fluctuates between $30 and $40; and, finally, one that predicts two cycles with prices fluctuating between $30 and $40. In the worst-case scenario  the steady decline to $30 a barrel  Texas state and local tax collections could drop by $130 billion over 15 years, the study found. The Texas economy overall could narrow by about $1.6 trillion, according to the analysis, which did not adjust dollars for inflation.",https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/insider/article/Volatile-Texas-oil-and-gas-industry-threatens-16003958.php

Toews made his remarks a day after tabling a budget that aims to reduce overall program spending by 2.8 per cent over four years and other measures to balance the books by 2023. The Kenney governments inaugural budget calls for scrapping tax incentives brought in by the NDP that were aimed at diversifying the economy toward tech and other sectors. Toews says the most effective way to get Albertas economic engine firing again is to make the overall business climate friendlier with lower corporate taxes.

Were taking the approach to broadly improve our competitiveness and business environment, Toews said Friday. We believe that is the most defensible approach to ensure that capital flows in the right places, that we diversify and grow our economy in a sustainable way, that government isn't picking winners and losers We believe that is the most defensible approach to ensure that capital flows in the right places, that we diversify and grow our economy in a sustainable way, that government isnt picking winners and losers. NDP Opposition Leader Rachel Notley blasted the government for giving tax breaks to big corporations while squeezing post-secondary students and people living with disabilities. She said the approach is not the way to get off the royalty revenue roller coaster. You dont diversify the economy by shutting the doors of our post-secondary institutions, making major cuts in the quality of the education people receive at the same time that you significantly increase the cost to students of walking through the doors of those post-secondary institutions, she said in Calgary. And of course, in addition to that, theyve cut a number of programs that our government had in place that were focused on economic diversification. Calgary Chamber of Commerce CEO Sandip Lalli said shes glad the provincial government has a plan to balance the budget, but she wants to know how it plans to diversify its mix of revenue with the help of innovation. Within this plan thats been tabled, theyre not ready to do that, she said. But I would really hope that they still continue to have conversations of how do we move that forward.

A lawsuit might be in the offing. Colorado regulators 2,000-foot buffer plan around drilling rekindles oil and gas wars Mark Jaffe Colorado Sun The Colorado oil and gas wars are back  if they ever left  sparked by state regulators plans unveiled Friday for a 2,000-foot buffer between drill sites and homes and schools. The regulation amounts to a ban on oil and gas development and a lawsuit might be in the offing, industry officials said. It is a last resort, said Lynn Granger, executive director of API-Colorado, a trade group, but we might have to visit that last resort. Sara Loflin, executive director of the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans, a grass-roots group, countered that the industrys doomsday predictions have never been true, and they arent now. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission reviewed the revised setback proposal, developed by staff at its direction, in a meeting held Friday on Zoom. The setback revision is part of an extensive overhaul of COGCC rules to reflect a change in the agencys mission from promoting oil and gas development to protecting public health, safety and welfare, and the environment. The change was mandated in Senate Bill 181.

Katie Porter is known for her hard-hitting style. In A screenshot from a virtual House Natural Resources subcommittee hearing on Tuesday. Screenshot by Mountain West News Bureau Originally published on March 12, 2021 10:21 am A Democratic firebrand in Congress has a new role overseeing the oil and gas industry. California Rep. Katie Porter is known for her hard-hitting style. In her first two years in Congress, she grilled bank executives as a member of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Now, as chair of the Natural Resources Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, she's doing the same to oil executives. At a hearing about drilling reforms on Tuesday, Porter chastised Mark Murphy, who runs a small oil and gas company that drills on federal lands in New Mexico. Murphy falsely said that the fossil fuel industry doesn't get special tax breaks. But they actually do, and Porter cut him off mid-sentence ""Please don't patronize me by telling me that the oil and gas industry doesn't have special tax provisions,"" Porter said. ""If you would like that to be the rule, I'm happy to have Congress deliver."" She said earlier in the hearing: ""The sweetheart deals obtained by fossil fuel lobbyists need to be blown up and it's to the benefit of all taxpayers to do so."" Porter spoke in support of a slew of new bills that would reform drilling on public lands, including her "" Ending Taxpayer Welfare for Oil and Gas Companies Act ,"" which would raise royalty rates on oil and gas companies for the first time in a century.

(Jeffery/Adobe Stock) March 12, 2021 GREEN RIVER, Utah - The Biden administration has ordered the Interior Departmentto conduct a review of the federal government's oil-and-gas leasing program on public lands, with an eye toward better management. About 38 million acres of onshore and offshore public lands are under lease, but critics says the program has been fraught for decades with organizational, financial and environmental problems. Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Prioritiessaid the government isn't getting a fair financial return for taxpayers, and has allowed the environmental degradation of America's public lands. ""Our hope is that the administration comes forward with a set of recommendations on how to fully modernize the program,"" said Weiss, ""so that we are fully accounting for the costs of oil and gas that is being extracted from America's public lands."" Weiss said three-quarters of the oil-and-gas leases are non-producing, which prevents them from being used for other purposes. The Interior Department has scheduled a virtual forum on March 25 to gather public input for the review. Weiss said he thinks the government also needs to set and enforce stricter environmental regulations, and address the mounting cleanup and remediation costs for abandoned wells, which he said are a major source of greenhouse gases. ""Making sure that the existing laws and policies that are on the books are fully compliant with bedrock conservation laws,"" said Weiss, ""like the Endangered Species Act, like the Clean Air Act. A combination of regulatory and legislative action."" The day-long forum will feature panels of industry representatives, labor and environmental groups, and other experts. Weiss said he believes the leasing program needs a top-to-bottom overhaul. ""Just the fees that they pay for leasing these public lands, those start at a $1.50 an acre,"" said Weiss. ""So, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can lock up acres of public lands and prevent them from being put to other use."" The Interior Department plans to release an interim report by early summer.

Undervalued blue chips, glove, oil and gas stocks to attract interest Dialog Group is among MIDF Research's top picks. PETALING JAYA: Citing improving prospects, MIDF Research has upgraded its outlook for the oil and gas sector to positive from neutral previously. We upgrade to positive both the upstream sub-segment and downstream sub-segment. This is premised on sustained recovery trajectory in both demand and product prices. We anticipate that both sub-segments will benefit from the recent rally in oil price in terms of potential new contract awards following a more palatable oil price,  MIDF Research said. It noted that there was also an increase in product prices and spreads for the downstream industry players. MIDF Research believes that the recovery narrative for the sector remains on track despite the absence of revision in exploration and production capital expenditures spending from oil majors. More selected spending approach will result in a more sustained recovery and significant uptick in activities within the oil and gas sector in the second half of the year,  it said. MIDF Research had also highlighted several counters that may benefit moving forward. We are expecting the oil and gas players to register stronger year-over-year earnings growth in the financial year 2021 after a series of commendable earnings recovery recorded from the third quarter of 2020 onwards. This is also in-line with our higher crude oil assumption for 2021 at US$58 per barrel from US$51 previously,  it said. MIDF Research said it reiterates its view of favouring companies that have been weathering the current pandemic successfully and coming out of it with minimal dent.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 11  Aimflex Bhd plans to diversify into the oil and gas, automotive and medical segments in a move to broaden its manufacturing automation business. Deputy managing director Emma Yazmeen Yip said the group remained optimistic about the diversification in order to have a more balanced customer portfolio. Having the research and development segment established last year, we are hopeful of achieving the diversification in a few years, she told Bernama after Aimflexs corporate rebranding launch today. The group, formerly known as i-Stone Group Bhd, was listed under Aimflex Bhd on Bursa Malaysia, effective February 25, 2021. Besides that, Emma said the group also leveraged the digital business specialising in automation, data management, system development, and application solution to build a smart and sustainable workflow. We are working on these segments to help and enable companies have a safe and cost-efficient operation. This is in line with the uptrend momentum of digital transformation, especially since Covid-19 broke out, she said. Managing director Rebecca Tee Sook Sing said Aimflex aimed to set up an office in the Philippines once the pandemic was brought under control as it has four engineers focusing on customers in that country. As at December 31, 2020, she said the group had utilised RM23 million out of the total proceeds of RM39 million from its initial public offering, while the remaining proceeds would be used accordingly in the next two to four years to leverage the business. Meanwhile, at the event, executive chairman Datuk Awang Daud Awang Putera announced that the company would adopt a dividend payout ratio of at least 30 per cent of profit after tax attributable to the owners of Aimflex for each financial year, excluding any unrealised income from adjustments due to accounting policies.

UPDATE 1-Russia's budget could get $27 bln oil and gas revenue boost in 2021 - ministry By 2 Min Read (Adds details, background) MOSCOW, March 11 (Reuters) - Russias federal budget could get a boost of more than 2 trillion roubles ($27 billion) from additional oil and gas revenues this year if oil prices and the rouble exchange rate remain at current levels, the finance ministry said on Thursday. These additional funds would be transferred to Russias National Wealth Fund, the ministry added. While oil prices, the lifeblood of Russias economy, have recovered to levels of around a year ago, the rouble is about 15% weaker as investors worry about the potential for more Western sanctions against Moscow amid ongoing tensions. Analysts have said Russias budget deficit, projected at 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, could narrow to 0.5% to GDP or even turn into a surplus if oil prices and the rouble remain around current levels. That could come in handy for the authorities ahead of parliamentary elections this autumn, which will be the last major vote before a presidential election due in 2024. Thanks to additional inflows, Russia may also slash its borrowing by 600-700 billion roubles this year from the originally planned 3.7 trillion in OFZ treasury bonds, allowing the state to keep its debt to GDP at no more than 20% over three years. $1 = 73.4400 roubles Reporting by Darya Korsunskaya.

By Pamela Johnson| johnsonp@reporter-herald.com| Loveland Reporter-Herald PUBLISHED: March 10, 2021 at 8:27 p.m. | UPDATED: March 10, 2021 at 8:30 p.m. Larimer County will take more time to revise its oil and gas land use rules, looking at the regulations piece by piece over the next several months, and has hired a specialized attorney to help. Last month, county planning staff released a schedule with a goal of updating the regulations by the end of April a timeline criticized by several residents who said it was just too quick to take ample public comment Now, the county is planning to adopt the updates by the end of July. County officials have released a draft calendar that splits the rules into three subtopics  land use and location, public health and environment, and compliance, fees and safety  and weaves public comment periods and meetings throughout that time frame. Principal planner Matt Lafferty described it as preparing, and fine-tuning, several different puzzle pieces along the way. Hopefully when we get down to May or so, we can piece them all together and have one unified plan, he said during a virtual meeting on Wednesday of the Larimer County Board of County Commissioners and the Planning Commission. Prior to 2020, Larimer County had no land use regulations surrounding oil and gas development; that section of the land use code was an empty page that the county began working to fill in 2019. A previous board of county commissioners adopted the first regulationslast April by a 2-1 vote with a group of residents, and one commissioner, saying they did not provide enough health and environmental protections. Since then, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission adopted new, stronger state regulations, and Larimer County voters elected two new commissioners. The three commissioners now serving have all said that they want to strengthen the health and environmental protections. The first step, outlined by county staff, is to compare Larimer Countys current rules to the state regulations as well as those on the books in surrounding counties. To help with this process, the county hired attorney Matt Sura, who has been working on oil and gas issues since 1996, including working with Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission on its new regulations on behalf of several different clients. Sura introduced himself during the Wednesday meeting. He said his resume includes representing governments, community groups, land and mineral owners  everyone except the oil and gas industry. He will work with county staff throughout the process of updating the rules, starting with the look at the existing rules alongside those in other jurisdictions.The county will host a virtual public meeting to discuss that comparison at 6 p.m. March 22. While all dates are still tentative, the county hopes to release draft plans on the following dates: April 5, location and land use, which includes setbacks; April 26, public health, welfare and environmental standards, including air and water quality and emergency response; May 7, compliance, fees and safety standards. A virtual public meeting, with opportunity for input, will follow each of those drafts. County staff will then put those pieces together into one overall draft of updated regulations, which officials expect to release around May 20, again followed by opportunity for public comment. In June and July, the proposal will go to the Larimer County Planning Commission, which will be asked to recommend approval, and then to the Board of County Commissioners for final approval. Tentative public hearings are set July 9, July 21 and July 26. The commissioners likely will be asked to adopt the new regulations on July 26 after the final public hearing with the rules going into effect on Aug. 1. Information on the process to update the oil and gas regulations is available in a section of the county website dedicated to the second phase of the land use code:",https://www.reporterherald.com/2021/03/10/larimer-county-taking-more-time-to-revise-oil-and-gas-rules-hires-specialized-attorney/

Fuel prices influence more than just surcharges for shipping and expenses for truckers, and on this episode of WHAT THE TRUCK?!? Dooner and The Dude learned how crucial the fuel market is to keeping freight moving. They welcomed Ryan Hunt, CEO of Rig CallOut, to talk about how the last year has impacted the oil and gas world. Hunt said he kept a close eye on the state of the market and when the oil market imploded in March of 2020, Rig CallOut was created to provide visibility. Rig CallOut gives logistics managers the capability to see where trucks are moving between rigs across the oil fields. Hunt said the fragmented nature of LTL logistics drove the idea behind RCO; he wanted to know why it was so hard to figure out where one truck carrying a quarter million dollars worth of pipe is. Transportation is very much like oil and gas, said Hunt, so he built the solution to marry both industries. Instead of building transportation software for a transportation company, we built a visibility tool and a communications tool for everyone.",https://www.freightwaves.com/news/evolve-the-future-of-oil-and-gas-visibility-what-the-truck

View Comments Investments in water midstream developments continued in the Permian Basin amid a growing need for water handling and recycling even as drilling operations slowed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the price per barrel of domestic crude oil continuing to struggle to lift past the $40 per barrel mark, after shrinking crude demands led by the public health crisis saw the price plummet below $0 per barrel of the first time in history in April, companies continued to bring facilities online to handle the immense water supplies needed and created by operations. Most new oil and gas drilling operations in New Mexico use hydraulic fracturing or fracking, which involves pumping a mixture of water, sand and chemicals underground to break up shale rocks and extract fossil fuels. It uses a lot of water. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. Each fracking well can use up to 1.5 million to 16 million gallons, per a report from the U.S. Geological Survey. And for every barrel of oil brought to the surface, fracking can bring up to 10 barrels of produced water  a combination of flowback from the initial frack and formation water brought up from the shale along with oil and gas. Traditionally, operators pump the produced water  often high in salt and toxic chemicals  back underground for disposal but in recent years companies in the Permian which spans southeast New Mexico and West Texas began recycling the water to reuse in future drilling operations in the arid region where water supplies are scarce. More: New Mexico sets hearing date to finalize new oil and gas methane rules On Oct. 27, Solaris Water Midstream announced it began operations at its Eddy State Complex, a water recycling and reuse facility on the New Mexico side of the Permian. The complex increased Solaris supply of recycled produced water by 300,000 barrels per day, and the company reported it was on track to recycle up to 25 million barrels in 2020. The Eddy State Complex added to the companys portfolio in the region along with its Lobo Reuse Complex in Eddy County and the Bronco Reuse Complex in Lea County. More: BLM planning to sell more New Mexico land to oil and gas in 2021 despite concerns Solaris expected two more water recycling centers to be completed by December, and when all five are online, the company will have the capacity to recycled up to 900,000 barrels per day and store more than 3 million barrels. Senior Vice President of Water Resources Michael Incerto said Solaris is also developing a network of mobile recycling systems that can be deployed to extraction sites for quicker water reuse throughout southeast New Mexicos oilfields. Together with the five water reuse complexes, these mobile recycling systems will take advantage of our extensive produced water pipeline network to support completions across a 2,500-square-mile area in southeast New Mexico, Incerto said. More: Report: Oil and gas leads New Mexico in greenhouse gas emissions, renewable sector growing Across the Permian Basin, Solaris also owns and operates 500 miles of water pipelines and more than 1 million barrels per day of disposal capacity. Chief Executive Officer Bill Zartlet said the company hopes to increase the regions capacity to recycle and reuse produced water within the industry to protect freshwater supplies and respond to the increasing volume needs of the industry. Recycling produced water at this unprecedented scale in New Mexico has always been one of our primary goals, he said. Our expansive pipeline infrastructure network makes it possible to aggregate hundreds of thousands of barrels of produced water every day from multiple operators in the basin, and then treat and recycle those barrels to our customers precise quality and flow specifications in the increasing volumes that operators are demanding. More: New Mexico eyeing stricter regulations, more fines on oil and gas spills Solaris President Amanda Bock said the company partnered with operators and other research organizations such as the New Mexico Produced Water Consortium and Produced Water Society to continue expanding the uses for produced water, potentially outside of the of oil and gas in sectors such as agriculture. We are also looking ahead, she said. we are evaluating innovative new options for beneficial reuse of recycled produced water in New Mexico and beyond. Upon forming the Consortium in September 2019, a joint venture between the New Mexico Environment Department and New Mexico State University via a memorandum of understanding, NMED Cabinet Secretary James Kenney said the waste water from oil and gas could be used to address New Mexicos increasingly scarce water supplies. More: Our state is continuing to take unprecedented steps forward to spur economic investment in furthering the science and technology associated with produced water and its potential treatment and reuse, he said. Through this partnership, science will guide our regulatory decision-making with respect to produced water treatment. Across the Texas State Line, another water midstream company dedicated 15 acres in the Midland Basin, within the greater Permian Basin region, for a water gathering and disposal operation to support a national oil and gas company as it begins operations in the region next year. More: Federal oil and gas leases in New Mexico attacked despite billions in revenue H20 Midstream entered the agreement with Sinclair Oil and Gas Company in Howard County to support Sinclair's operations in the area expected to begin in early 2021. The project saw H20 upgrading its 200-mile water gathering, disposal and recycling system to ensure all of Sinclair's water is moved via pipeline to reduce truck traffic. ""We appreciate the flexibility and creativity of the Sinclair team as we negotiated the terms of this agreement during an uncertain business climate with commodity prices in flux,"" said Jim Summers, Chief Executive Officer at H2O Midstream.

Market watchers believe the investors are taking position on oil and gas stocks as ease in lock down which has increased spending on transportation. The consequences of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak had threatened the resilient outlook for Nigerias economy mainly supported by the oil and gas sector. Speaking on the outlook for the rest of the first quarter (Q1) 2021, David Adonri, Managing Director/CEO, Highcap Securities Limited, had said: If the results and dividends announced by major companies are impressive, and if the rally in crude oil price is sustained, and if yield on debt does not go higher, demand for equities may increase and stem the tide of decline. Ayodeji Ebo, Senior Economist/ Head, Research & Strategy, Greenwich Merchant Bank, said: Rising fixed income yields will continue to suppress the performance of the equities market, however, influx of impressive financial performance and corporate actions will reduce the impact. Investors will cherry pick stocks with good fundamentals. However, as full year corporate actions releases wind down, we expect the equities market to dip presenting new entry opportunities. On the outlook for this month, Toyin Sanni said: For the month of March, there is likely going to be a rebound in the market as investors buy back at discounts and also position themselves to meet the closure of register deadlines for dividend payment which have been announced. Listed companies are positioned to record positive performances in the first quarter of the year 2021 as the COVID-19 recovery kicks in and economic activities return to normal. This could contribute to a significant uptrend in the market as a response. However, if the yields in the money market and fixed income space continue to increase at their current pace, it could lead to outflow of funds from the stock market in the longer run, leading to a bearish performance. The recent improvement in the rate environment in the USA could also lead to foreign capital flowing out of the Nigerian markets to a more stable environment.",https://www.newtelegraphng.com/oil-and-gas-stocks-record-n82bn-gain-in-2-months/

As a lifelong hunter and angler, I rely on these rivers, Hadley Provided photo In Montana, we are fortunate to have access to some of the most iconic public lands in the country. As a lifelong hunter and angler, I rely on these rivers, streams and forests to pursue my passions. Public lands sustain the Montanan way of life, and we deserve policies that protect them and responsibly manage their use. Unfortunately, the current federal oil and gas leasing system is broken, and fails to protect these valuable areas while while also harming taxpayers through wasteful policies. The Biden administrations recent decision to pause new oil and gas leasing recognizes the value that wildlife and outdoor recreation activities bring to Montana and offers an important opportunity to make crucial changes to this system. A major problem that this system has perpetuated, especially in Montana, is noncompetitive leasing: a loophole that allows oil and gas companies to lease public lands for cut-rate prices. In just the last four years, less than half of all proposed acres in Montana sold at a competitive auction; the acres that were not sold then became available to oil and gas companies for a paltry $1.50 an acre. Not only does this harmful practice waste limited government resources, it also prioritizes public lands for oil and gas rather than conservation or recreation. The Lewistown Resource Management Plan  a proposal that spanned 650,000 acres of public lands in central Montana  is a prime example of why leasing reform is urgently needed. This plan, which was illegally approved by former BLM Director William Perry Pendley, opens 95% of the area, one of North Americas most productive big game habitats, to oil and gas leasing, even though it holds little oil potential. Luckily, this plan was tossed by a federal judge; but the underlying policies that made it so dangerous persist. Noncompetitive leasing has surged to record levels in recent years, despite 99% of noncompetitive leases never entering development. Montanas wildlife, land, and thriving outdoor recreation economy suffer when our government cannot dedicate time and resources to improving habitat and maintaining trails, fishing access sites, and other public land infrastructure. Fortunately, Sen. Jon Tester has introduced legislation to help reform this broken system, bring transparency back to public lands management, and end the wasteful practice of noncompetitive leasing. I strongly encourage the Biden administration and Congress to support this desperately needed legislation and protect access to Americas public lands for their multiple uses. Montanans are ready for this change. According to the recent Conservation in the West poll from Colorado College, 70% of Montanans think that oil and gas development on national public lands should be stopped or strictly limited, as opposed to expanded. We know the best way forward is to reform federal leasing and create a better system that protects our prized hunting and fishing grounds. Montana has very little oil to begin with -- there are currently no active drill rigs in the state -- so its just common-sense to better manage these landscapes so they work for everyone. The Biden administration has taken critical first steps to preserve our precious wildlife areas by halting all new oil and gas leasing on public lands and waters. I encourage the President to continue to listen to Montanans and build on this effort by reviewing and reforming the federal leasing system. Only then can we guarantee that our cherished public lands and wildlife are safeguarded and our time-honored traditions are passed down for generations to come.

This lack of openness has led to zero accountability, mismanagement of funds, revenue leakages and above all, the inability of the government to meet its financial obligation and to raise the quality of life of Nigerians, NAREPs team lead, Akintunde Babatunde, said. To respond to these challenges of access to information in the oil and gas sector, the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism is organising this flagship NAREP oil and gas media fellowship, he added.

Last Updated February 17, 2021 3 minute read In this file photo, Emily Eaton, a professor in the department of geology and environmental science at the U of R, stands in the map library in the university's classroom building. Photo by BRANDON HARDER / Regina Leader-Post REGINA   A judge has ruled that the University of Regina must provide information to one of its professors about who is funding research into the oil and gas industry. Ultimately, requiring that funding identity information be disclosed is in keeping with promoting transparency, openness and accountability in public institutions, such as the university, Justice Meghan McCreary wrote in her decision released Tuesday. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team . Emily Eaton, who teaches in the universitys geography and environmental studies department, is researching the influence of the fossil fuel industry on education in Saskatchewan. Under freedom-of-information legislation, she requested that the school disclose who is funding research related to oil and gas, coal, carbon capture and climate change, as well as which departments receive the money. Eaton was denied her request and turned to the courts. The university used a discretionary class exemption in the provinces freedom-of-information laws that allowed it refuse to provide details of the academic research. But McCreary ruled that the types of records Eaton requested did not fall within the exemption. This is because disclosing the amount of funding does not reveal the particulars of the research  the questions, methodology, results and conclusions of the research, itself, the judge wrote. She said she agrees with the university that there may be harms in disclosing funding identity information, but that it did not provide enough evidence that it would be the case in this situation. Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. The university is entitled to consider whether disclosing funding identity information for any specific research may result in harm prohibited by other provisions of (the act), she said. However, I reiterate that the effect of my decision is that the university cannot rely on (this section of the act) as a blanket exemption to refuse to provide funding identity information. She added that if the university does not find proper reasoning, the research files in question must be disclosed. If this information is publicly available it provides community members with information that may be relevant to the context of the academic research, thereby providing the public with the ability to consider, analyze and debate the funding choices made by a public institution. Eaton applauded McCrearys decision on Twitter, calling it a positive precedent for transparency of fossil fuel funding in university research. In a statement late Tuesday, the University of Regina said the decision provides clarity on the application of the freedom-of-information exemption it used in the case, which had not previously been considered by the court. Rather than allowing the university to complete its review for relevant records and awaiting the universitys formal response (and release of information), Dr. Eaton sought to challenge the application of this particular exemption provision, the emailed statement said. Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. The university noted that it was always willing to provide some of the information to Eaton and she is also free to directly request that each of her colleagues provide it. The universitys position has always been based on protecting our researchers and ensuring research integrity as required. Often, university researchers are conducting work that is unique, sensitive, controversial, confidential and potentially proprietary in nature, the statement said. Releasing information related to some research activities could put research at risk, and undermine competitiveness both for the university and its researchers.

These two sectors alone garnered 73 per cent of 25,788 crore that the FPIs pumped into Indian equities in February. Sector-wise analysis of FPI inflows in the equity segment shows that the Financial Services sector alone received a net inflow of 14,266 crore in February, of which 6,197 crore went to Banks, The remaining went to Other Financial Services segment that spans financial institutions (FIs), NBFCs and housing finance companies (HFCs), among others. In its Foreign Sectoral Flow Insight for March-21, Edelweiss Alternative Research said, After the pro-growth Union Budget on February 1, in line with our expectations, FPIs once again became net buyers in Banking & Financials as they deployed $1.96 billion, which is almost 55 per cent of the $3.56 billion (Total inflow). The sector is now 34.8 per cent of FPI AUM vs 33.8 per cent in Jan-21. Changing preferences Amid signs of a V-shaped economic recovery after the pandemic, foreign investors turned their focus on cyclical and economy-oriented sectors such as capital goods, automobile and auto components and metals and mining over the last three months. For instance, the Capital Goods sector witnessed a net inflow of 10,869 crore during November 2020 and January 2021 as opposed to an inflow of just 2,700 crore between April and October. Similarly, the Metals & Mining sector got 7,009 crore of net investment between November and January against net outflow of 1,953 crore in the first seven months of FY21. While FPIs pulled out 3,908 crore in January, they have increased their weightage in the sector again in February. Top gainers With robust FPI flows and ensuing liquidity, we expect the sector to continue to garner FPI interest in March as well, the Edelweiss report noted. FPIs have pumped in record investment of 2.64-lakh crore into Indian equities between April 2020 and February 2021. Of the total inflow, 30 per cent or 78,075 crore went to the financial services sector. Oil & Gas was the other major gainer in the equity segment with a net inflow of 4,467 crore in February. The next sector which attracted FPIs was Oil & Gas as they parked $676 million which is the highest monthly flows since March 2019. This is almost 20 per cent of the total inflows. The FPI weightage in AUM now stands at 11.3 per cent vs 10.7 per cent on January 21, the Edelweiss report said. Insurance (1,782 crore), Retailing (1,838 crore) and Telecom services (1,777 crore) were the other major beneficiaries in February, while Software & Services (2,333 crore) and Food, Beverages & Tobacco (2,317 crore) witnessed net outflow during the month.

All energy sources had their problems, but an honest take is suspiciously harder to come by than you would think. Beyond just electricity, natural gasand gasolineprices in California are 40-60% higher than the national average. Californias energy policies are actually a cautionary tale. Experts warn that the states high energy prices hurt people of colormost and could actually turn public sentimentagainst the transition to electrification and more wind and solar development. California's electricity prices have been rising way too fast. EIA; JTC Oil Comeback Thanks to the vaccine rollout, stimulus packages, extra 1 million b/d production cut from Saudi Arabia, weaker dollar, etc. oil prices have been on the rise. Both WTI and Brent crude have hit above $65/barrel as of late, widely expected to sail into the $70-75 range in high demand summer ( the travel bounce back is coming ). With no material substitute, the reports of the death of the worlds most vital fuel have been greatly exaggerated: in a V-shaped recovery,  . The U.S. shale oil industry, however, must be sure to not overproduce as prices increase. Our crude production has been hovering around 11.0 million b/d for months, down from the record highs of 13.3 million b/d seen in late-2019. In particular, the smaller independents needing cash are under pressure to stay disciplined with CAPEX spending while strengthening balance sheets. If prices average ~$55, it should a solid rebound year for the U.S. oil industry. Wood Mac reportsthat the focus to cut costs last year lowered breakeven prices to ~$38, down from ~$55 pre-Covid. Higher oil prices have the industry ready for a recovery in free cash flow, maybe even topping $140 billion in 2021, the most since 2006. Indeed, in our goal to lower greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, a healthy U.S. oil industry is a necessity. Many journalists, academics, and climate suit-happy governments want us to go after Big Oil, i.e., our own western international oil companies (IOCs), such as BP, Chevron, Total, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and more generally including the larger independents. But market realities dictate that these publicly traded companies are anything but Big Oil, especially as they evolve more into the low-carbon gas renewables and net-zerospaces (Figure). Not just as a critical employer, mutual funds mainstay, taxpayer, and thin line between domestic supply and the requirement for imports to meet our ~20 million b/d consumption level, there is an obvious need to support our oil companies. In reality of course, Big Oil is their competition: the national oil companies that have endless backing from their own governments. Think OPEC, Russias national champions, and Chinas state-owned enterprises. As it turns out, Big Oil is those that thrive on monopolistic power, not playing by international norms, few environmental regulations, and manipulating the global market to advance their own governments political interests. This also explains why the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) movement must proceed extremely cautiously in pushing the IOCs and independents, at risk of just handing the global oil market to such rogue players.

The Plunging oil prices pull energy stocks lower, erasing gains Back to video Investors are waiting to hear from the Federal Reserve, which begins a two-day meeting on interest rates. Most economists expect it to raise short-term rates by another quarter of a percentage point, but investors hope that it will signal a slower pace of increases ahead. KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index fell 14 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 2,531 as of 3 p.m. Eastern time. On Monday it closed at its lowest since October 2017 amid worries about slowing economic growth, higher interest and global trade tensions.

The index is still 20 per cent below the peak it set in August, meaning its in what Wall Street calls a bear market. THE QUOTE: There havent been any big developments in U.S.-China trade talks since the beginning of this month. JJ Kinahan, chief markets strategist for TD Ameritrade, said investors are confused about the state of the trade dispute and are reluctant to commit to stocks, while businesses arent spending. We dont know the rules of the game, he said. People cant plan. When you cant plan, youre not anxious to buy stocks. CRUDE AWAKENING: The price of oil continued to tumble and is at its lowest since August 2017. Benchmark U.S. crude plunged 7.3 per cent to $46.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, sank 5.6 per cent to $56.26 a barrel in London. Crude oil has plunged by more than one-third since early October as traders worried about a slowdown in the global economy and an increase in supply. Both would hurt prices. While OPEC and several other countries recently agreed to cut production of oil in 2019, it was unclear if the cut is large enough to balance supply and demand. Theyre not the only game in town anymore, Kinahan said of OPEC. He said rising oil production in the U.S. and a combination of alternative fuels and greater efficiency by businesses has reduced OPECs ability to sway the oil market.

Article content On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. shale oil production will keep climbing in January, and the Wall Street Journal reported that oil production in Russia reached a record high in December. FED MEETING: Most economists expect the Fed to raise its short-term interest rate Wednesday afternoon. While investors expect rates to go up, they also hope that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will signal that the Fed is pausing its campaign of rate hikes. The Feds rates help set borrowing costs for various types of loans. Higher rates can slow economic growth, something investors are already worrying about, and make stocks look relatively less attractive. TAKING OFF: Aerospace company Boeing surged to one of the markets biggest gains after it raised its dividend 20 per cent and increased its stock buyback program to $20 billion. Boeings stock has struggled recently on worries that the global trade war will hit its profits particularly hard. Boeing rose 4 per cent to $328.85. The stock is down 16 per cent since early October. Several other companies that have recently suffered big losses also said they will buy back more stock. Those included health care products giant Johnson & Johnson and insurer Allstate. DELUXE APARTMENT IN THE SKY: The Commerce Department said developers broke ground on more apartments in November, and homebuilders climbed. Lennar gained 2.2 per cent to $40.90 and NVR added 1.3 per cent to $2,485. The companies have taken huge losses this year as rising mortgage rates and prices have reduced home sales.

Apartment building owner AvalonBay Communities gained 1.6 per cent to $182.76 and CBRE Group rose 4.7 per cent to $41.30. Real estate companies had taken sharp losses Monday.

166,"North Dakota oil production dropped 4 percent in February, but prices are up 50 percent",willistonherald,"Mar 11, 2021",2021-03-11 22:54:00,"North Dakota production dropped a little more than expected in February to 1.147 million barrels per day of production, a figure that is also 4 percent below the states revenue Save North Dakota production dropped a little more than expected in February to 1.147 million barrels per day of production, a figure that is also 4 percent below the states revenue forecasts. The lower than expected production rate was somewhat offset by prices that were 10 percent higher than expected for January and 50 percent higher than expected for February. North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said the unexpected production drop was largely due to 90 miles per hour straight line wind, which put the lights out for around 50,000 barrels per day of production for 10 days or so. Averaged out over the month, thats about 16,000 barrels per day of lost production. The price rally, meanwhile, is also due to an unexpected turn of events. OPEC in its March 4 meeting had been expected to add 1.5 million barrels per day to production quotas, but thats not what they did after all. Instead, Saudi Arabia argued for continuing their voluntary million barrel per day cut. Ultimately, the body added back 150,000 barrels per day, just 10 percent of the expected addition. That sparked a rapid rise in oil prices. Now, interestingly enough, folks who are tracking tankers leaving Saudi ports say they are not cutting a million a day, Helms added. They only cut about 300,000 barrels a day. Making up that big a difference would take very significant cuts, well beyond whats likely for any voluntary cut. And so theyre trying to manage oil prices, Helms said. They have increased their price projections. They were trying to keep prices between $45 and $55. Theyre now targeting between $50 and $60. Storage around the world, meanwhile, continues to drop. Except in the United States. The February energy debacle in Texas caused a refinery shutdown. And that will take some time to work through. Gas production, meanwhile, dropped 1.4 percent to 2.847 billion MCF per day. That was with a 94 percent gas capture rate, which meets or exceeds state requirements. For now. Rig counts in North Dakota are up three from January at 15  right on track with what the state projected for its revenue forecast. Dont expect any big changes to rig counts for 2021 until at least October. Thats when companies will begin considering their 2022 capital expenditures. They may make some adjustments then, depending on market conditions. That is all assuming nothing dramatic happens between now and then to change the markets mind. The market doesnt think that these are the long-term oil prices, Helms said. If you look at EIA, or even if you look at NYMEX, they all see this as a short-term peak, and that the oil prices dwindle off to the upper 50s by you know within the next year or two. Given these conditions, companies could take in more capital than expected. But finishing Drilled Uncompleted Wells, returning wells to production, and debt repayment are more likely uses of such capital than added drilling rigs. North Dakota still has an estimated 107 or so wells shut in from the pandemic, and it has lots of DUCs waiting in a row for completion. We are down to the last stages of the shut-in wells from the pandemic and the price collapse we saw in May, Helms said.",https://www.willistonherald.com/news/oil_and_energy/north-dakota-oil-production-dropped-4-percent-in-february-but-prices-are-up-50-percent/article_b4ba8656-82bc-11eb-8b77-33c030aa0ecb.html

The petroleum reserve was created in the wake of the 1970s Arab oil embargo. The reserve stores oil at four underground sites in Texas and Louisiana. Gasoline prices have increased by at least 10 cents a gallon since Harvey came ashore and caused record flooding, shutting down oil refineries along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. More than one-fifth of U.S. refining capacity has been shuttered, according to S&P Global Platts. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

The price spike is more dramatic in some states such as Georgia, where the average cost per gallon of regular gas has climbed from $2.22 a week ago to $2.39 now. It could take two weeks or longer before big refineries in the Houston area can recover from a record-setting deluge and resume normal operations. President Donald Trump has proposed selling nearly half the petroleum reserve amid an oil production boom that has seen U.S. imports drop sharply in the past decade. Trumps budget calls for selling up to 270 million barrels of oil over the next decade, raising an estimated $16.6 billion. The proposal, on top of planned auctions expected over the next few years, could push the reserve below 300 million barrels by 2025. It now is at 679 million barrels.

Ltd. and 14 other Japanese companies that use city gas have formed an alliance to enhance the use of carbon neutral LNG to help tackle climate change, they said on March 9. Carbon neutral LNG typically involves companies supporting projects that reduce emissions to compensate for emissions generated from exploration and production. The move, which comes as carbon reduction targets tighten around the world, may encourage global gas producers to offer cleaner supplies. Members of the new Carbon Neutral LNG Buyers Alliance come from various industries and include Toshiba Corp., Isuzu Motors Ltd. and Mitsubishi Estate Co. Ltd. In 2019, Tokyo Gas, Japans biggest seller of city gas, bought a cargo of carbon neutral LNG from Royal Dutch Shell, which also supplied a similar cargo to South Koreas GS Energy, Taiwans CPC Corp and China National Offshore Oil Corp., or CNOOC. Tokyo Gas has already sold some of the supply to its local customers and it wants to expand the buyers network, Kunio Nohata, the companys executive vice president, told a news conference. We are seeking an innovation in hydrogen, methanation and carbon capture utilization technology, but it may take time, he said. Therefore, we want to spread the use of carbon neutral LNG which is the most feasible measure right now to slash CO 2 emissions, he said. Nohata declined to comment on the cost of carbon neutral LNG, citing confidentiality obligations. Tokyo Gas hopes more LNG producers will offer carbon neutral LNG so that it can widen its procurement sources, he said. In February, Hokkaido Gas Co. Ltd. said it will buy carbon neutral LNG, which will account for about 10% of its annual LNG purchases, from Mitsui & Co Ltd.",http://oilandgasinvestor.com/news/tokyo-gas-14-users-form-alliance-boost-use-carbon-neutral-lng-192808

OPEC+ extended the cuts through April, aside from a slight increase allowed for Russia and Kazakhstan, due to seasonal consumption patterns. Even Saudi Arabia decided to keep its 1 mb/d of voluntary cuts in place. The surprise news led to a price surge.

Related Video: Goldman Predicts $70 Oil in Q2 Oil majors expect record cash flow. Big Oil is looking at 2021 with increased optimism, mostly because oil prices have rallied in recent weeks. Moreover, the ultra-conservative capital spending plans and the huge cost cuts have allowed international oil companies (IOCs) to materially lower their cash flow breakevens. These factors are set to result in a record cash flowfor the biggest oil firms this year if oil prices average $55 per barrel, Wood Mackenzie said in new research. Oil majors going green? Speaking from the annual CERAWeek by IHS Markit energy conference, Big Oil chief executives from Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corp.(NYSE:CVX), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)have all spoken about the industrys transition to a lower-carbon world, with OXY even branding itself a carbon management company that wants to set the industry standard for the production of net-zero carbon oil.

IHS Markit: Shale discipline likely to stay. U.S. shale is unlikely to return to aggressive spending, but rising oil prices could tempt drillers to get off the sidelines. At any given price growth will be less than in years past but if you get into the $70-$75 per barrel oil range, you can both return money to investors and have strong growth ... so there is a point at which the temptation becomes too strong, Raoul LeBlanc of IHS Markit saidat CERAWeek. Pioneer: very little shale growth. U.S. oil production will likely seevery little growth in the future after remaining largely flat in 2021 at around 11 million barrels a day, Scott Sheffield, Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD) chief executive officer, said at CERAWeek. ExxonMobil offers a new strategy. At ExxonMobils (NYSE: XOM) Investor Day, it outlinedplans to keep production flat and return excess cash to shareholders, and/or cut debt.

170,The Largest Oil Lobby In America Is Now Backing A Carbon Tax,oilprice,"Mar 05, 2021",2021-03-05 18:00:00,"The U.S. API changed its mind and is now backing a carbon tax, but besides a boost in public relations, what made the oil lobby an advocate The American Petroleum Institute API now advocates a carbon tax We had to read the APIs press release twice to make sure we were reading correctly. Whatever else this accomplished we believe at the very least they pulled off a public relations coup designed to delay carbon suppression behind a smokescreen of reasonableness.  There is no shortage of informed opinion on this issue. Like any broad public policy it has advocates and detractors. Proponents hail its economic efficiency and that it pushes the government further away from the energy industrys decision making. Detractors, which interestingly hail from both sides of the US political aisle, claim this policy only leads to incremental, non-systemic decisions and a piecemeal approach to a serious environmental issue. Rather than get embroiled in this debate, we would rather acknowledge it as an issue but instead look at two key bread and butter issues.  First, energy demand is price inelastic. This is a fancy way of saying that demand for the product does not react much to change in price. In the case of energy, price elasticity is estimated at roughly -0.2 short term and -0.6 long term. In other words a 10% price increase in electricity will only reduce demand for energy by 2% in the short term. In the long haul trucking business, for example drivers dont simply walk off the job if gasoline or diesel prices shoot up dramatically. Although they might cut speeds a bit to reduce fuel consumption. Over the long term, however, a 10% price increase reduces demand by 6%. Staying with our present example, this suggests that longer term drivers and their industry may respond to higher prices by purchasing more fuel efficient vehicles once the present rig wears out. Thus it will take a big carbon tax to reduce consumer and industrial demand by a significant amount. And the likelihood that Congress will impose a big tax seems remote.  Related India OPEC Decision Could Derail Oil Demand Recovery  Second, energy consumers may regard a prospective carbon tax simply as payment for a license to pollute especially if the tax starts out as a small one. As our example above shows this is not likely to meaningfully reduce energy demand or reduce the accompanying pollution. We can analogize to parking tickets that routinely appear on delivery van windshields in a busy urban area. The tickets may be a nuisance but in the end they are simply a cost of doing business. Warnings against penalties such as taxation as a form of behavioral regulation date back to Adam Smith. Basically, once people start to pay a regular penalty to do something deemed anti-social or immoral, they tend not to feel obligated to consider revising their behaviors.  The oil industry, like any industry facing some existential threat to consumer demand for its products, wants to avoid controls or timetables from the government that dictate to consumers specifically how much or what sort of energy they can use. Our readers know that certain municipalities in California have already banned the installation of natural gas appliances in new construction. At the same time, the oil companies, at least some of them, no longer want to be seen as climate change deniers. The industrys goal here it seems is to portray itself in a favorable light, sounding reasonable while delaying activities that significantly reduce energy demand.  Related Oil Flirts With $70 After The OPEC Surprise  We expect in its defense the oil industry will claim, with much evidence, that governments make inefficient choices when directing technology like that of carbon attenuation. In addition, since the free market is a better resource allocator than an intrusive government, why not depend on the market That will no doubt resonate with more conservative legislators. Institute a tax, but one thats not too big because that would have negative economic consequences.  But there is a policy conflict here. We also expect the same energy companies whose business is being adversely affected by potential taxation and very uncertain demand trends, to happily invest to accelerate a carbon-free future. The optimal result for the oil industry at this juncture we believe would be a minimal tax, a small reduction in demand, and plenty of time to keep drilling. Which brings up the cautionary comment by the late Saudi oil minister, Sheikh Yamani, that the stone age did not end because of a shortage of stones. To sum up, The APIs recent statement in favor of a modest carbon tax is a brilliant move. It at once shifts the discussion, and makes the industry appear reasonable but we suspect will ultimately fail to sway many policy makers.

The application does not mention any particular pipelines, but there will be a hearing on April 9 to discuss a potential shutdown of the Dakota Access pipeline, while further court-ordered environmental study of the pipeline is conducted. Bridgers proposed 29.4-mile, 8-inch crude oil transmission line would take crude from Eighty Eight Oil companys existing Johnsons Corner Terminal in North Dakota to Bridgers existing Wilson station, about 7 miles south of Watford City. From there, the oil would travel to Wyoming, where it could access other markets and refineries in Utah and Colorado, as well as trading centers in Cushing, Oklahoma and Patoka, Illinois. A public hearing for the proposed transmission line is set for 8 a.m. CST March 22 at Teddys Residential Suites, 113 Ninth Avenue SE in Watford City. In addition to in-person participation, individuals may also participate virtually at https://psc.nd.gov/public/meetings/live.phpor telephonically by calling 888-585-9008. In either case, the room code is 259-316-322. Written comments may also be sent to the Public Service Commission, 600 E. Boulevard Ave., Dept. 408, Bismarck, ND 58505-0480. During the March 22 hearing, the Commission will consider whether Bridgers project minimizes adverse effects on the environment and the welfare of citizens in the state, as well as whether the project is compatible with the environmental preservation and efficient use of natural resources. The commission is also tasked with ensuring that construction, operation, and maintenance of the proposed project ensures system reliability and integrity, so that energy needs are met and fulfilled in an orderly and timely fashion. The siting application for this project followed a request by the company in March for permission to let some oil from Four Bears Pipeline flow into the existing Kermit to Wilson gathering line. That would give Bridgers system more capacity without disturbing any dirt or requiring any new construction. The North Dakota Public Service Commission granted that request, but directed the company to file a siting application for converting the 27-mile Kermit to Wilson gathering line, constructed in 2018 to support growing production at Johnsons Corner. The company decided it would add a 2.4 mile pipeline to the existing Kermit to Wilson line in the siting application. That makes the proposed transmission line 29.4 miles in total length, for an estimated cost of $21 million. The completed transmission line will include an electronic monitoring device and alarm system that will keep track of flow and pressure for the system around-the-clock, as well as automatically warn operators if there are any leaks. True Companies is also the parent company of Belle Fourche Pipelines, which was responsible for one of North Dakotas largest crude oil leaks affecting a water body. The company's Bicentennial leaked 12,615 barrels of crude oil into the nearby Ash Coulee Creek, a tributary of the Little Missouri River, just north of Medora in Billings County, when a hillside in the area slumped. ***Content Box*** A hearing is set for 8 a.m. March 22.

Petrochemical boss Stephen Bell and Andrew Richards from the Energy Users Association, which represents large energy users such as Bluescope and Brickworks, dismissed Victorian Energy Minister Lily DAmbrosios claimthat the shortfall from Yallourns exit can be filled with renewable power, new transmission and big batteries yet to be built. Recalling how wholesale electricity prices surged to more than $100 per megawatt-hou r after Hazelwoods closure , Mr Bell, who runs Qenos manufacturing plants in Altona and Botany, said gas-fired power plants must be part of the energy mix to plug the hole left by Yallourn. The Hazelwood closure really did have quite an impact on the market, our electricity prices doubled. We need to include gas-fired power. Manufacturing and industry need reliable, dispatchable, cheap baseload power and plenty of it,  he said. Energy Australia will close the Yallourn power station in Victorias Latrobe Valley in mid-2028 Joe Armao What I want to know is wheres that going to come from when? How much will electricity cost, wheres the plan? Related Quotes Advertisement Asked about the state governments position on gas power, Ms DAmbrosio stood by her statement on Thursday which avoided any mention of gas and instead pointed to the massive renewables investment in the state. There will be more than 5000 megawatts of renewable energy coming online in Victoria by 2028, which will more than offset the exit of Yallourn, she said. on Wednesday that it would close the 48-year-old Yallourn coal-fired power plant in Victoria in mid-2028, four years earlier than scheduled. It comes as Australias ageing coal fleet struggles to compete against cheaper renewables, and is a sign that other ageing thermal generators may shut earlier than expected. Australian Industry Group head of policy Tennant Reed said there was still a lot of work to be done to transform the market to plug the gap left by Yallourn, and a few other coal power stations that are expected to close early, but seven years should be enough time to achieve that. Members are still digesting this, Mr Reed said. Advertisement Theres a lot of opportunity over the next seven years to prepare for this. And collectively, there will be no excuses if were not prepared for it in seven years time. I havent heard any definitive fears that its already too late to respond. Nobody has that pessimistic view at this point. And frankly, theres a lot of positive activity that indicates that we should be able to deal with it. But it hasnt all been locked down yet. And thats the job for the next few years. Really, seven years notice is an aeon.  Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull That includes a series of major transmission and storage projects that are at various stages of readiness, mooted gas and renewable generation projects as well as the demand response mechanism that is being introduced to the wholesale market. Still, Mr Bell is unconvinced that the market will be able to provide competitively priced power once Yallourn - and possible other coal generators in Victoria and NSW - shuts off operations. Advertisement How are we going to get competitively priced power to replace whats being taken away? he asked. The glib response of theres plenty of renewables being put in thats not much help to aluminium smelters, or a heavy industrial energy-intensive operations. Were relying on having that reliable power 24/7, he said. Mr Richards praised Energy Australia for giving customers seven years to prepare for the shutdown, but he took aim at Ms DAmbrosios focus on renewables rather than gas. To say renewable energy is going to replace Yallourn is just technically wrong, because renewable energy doesnt provide all the services to the market that thermal generation currently provides. It doesnt provide system strength or inertia, its not dispatchable. So, these are the things that thermal generation provide so by just slapping in another 5000 megawatts of wind farms or solar farms wont solve the problem. The past few months have seen several new battery projects announced, including a large 300-megawatt battery by Frances Neoen near Geelong that can run for 90 minutes, as well as EnergyAustralias commitment to build a four-hour, 350-megawatt battery at Jeeralang. Advertisement But as in NSW, investments in new gas plants remain firmly on the drawing board with little progress evident at projects including AGL Energys proposed Tarrone peaking plant west of Macarthur. APA Group has also proposed a 220-megawatt gas power plant at Dandenong, one of two projects shortlisted in the federal governments Underwriting New Generation Investments program, which now appears to have stalled. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull weighed in on Friday, telling a conference that seven years was plenty of time to plan the transition as Snowy Hydro 2.0 could comfortably fill the gap left by Yallourn. By 2025 Snowy 2.0 will be operating, by 2028 you could double that. There are gazillions of projects, right? There is enough water in those two damns alone to have 8000 megawatts of pumped hydro there if you want to; and, so, by 2028, they should have Snowy 3.0 built.

181,The Commodities Feed: Big crude builds and product draws,menafn,"Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10 23:39:46,"Energy Oil prices were fairly volatile yesterday, with ICE Brent trading in almost a US$2/bbl range, although the market did manage to claw its way back above US$68/bbl, and settle higher for the day. USD weakness would have offered some support. The EIA report would have also provided a boost. While the weekly numbers showed that US crude oil inventori Tweet on Twitter (MENAFN - ING)  Energy Oil prices were fairly volatile yesterday, with ICE Brent trading in almost a US$2/bbl range, although the market did manage to claw its way back above US$68/bbl, and settle higher for the day. USD weakness would have offered some support. The EIA report would have also provided a boost. While the weekly numbers showed that US crude oil inventories increased by a significant 13.8MMbbls over the last reporting week, this build was more than offset by the large draws on the refined product side. Gasoline and distillate fuel oil stocks fell by 11.87MMbbls and 5.5MMbbls respectively. As mentioned in previous updates, this trend was expected, given that the refining industry in the US Gulf Coast has taken quite some time to get back up to speed following the freezing conditions seen in February. Refinery utilization increased by 13 percentage points over the week, however with refinery utilization at 69%, it is still well below the 83% seen in early February. The disruptions as a result of the freezing conditions have meant that US crude oil inventories have started to trend quite a bit higher from the 5-year average once again. Ahead of the disruptions, US crude oil stocks had finally made their way back to the 5-year average, but now stand around 28MMbbls above this average, and not far off from 500MMbbls. With total gasoline stocks standing at a little under 232MMbbls, they are the lowest they have been in at least 5 years at this stage of the year. This has been supportive for gasoline cracks, with the front-month RBOB crack now trading above US$22/bbl, up from a little over US$10/bbl towards the middle of February. Finally, after the surprise decision from OPEC+ to largely rollover current output cuts into April, we have seen more oil producers increasing their official selling prices (OSP). Over the weekend the Saudis increased their OSP for Arab Light into Asia for April shipment by US$0.40/bbl to US$1.40/bbl over the benchmark, and to the highest level since March last year. Yesterday Iraq followed suit, increasing its OSP for Basrah Light into Asia by US$0.15/bbl to US$1.30/bbl over the benchmark for April. Rising OSPs would not be welcome by refiners, as they have already had to deal with weaker margins more recently, following the rally we have seen in crude oil prices. Metals A pause in rising US Treasury yields offered some support to the precious metals complex. Gold managed to hold onto its gains with an additional boost from a pickup in US headline inflation and a soft dollar. After a recent correction, platinum also sprang back yesterday, rallying over 2%. This is despite the latest report from the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC) showing that they expect the platinum deficit in 2021 to shrink to 60koz from 932koz last year. Copper also received a boost with concerns over a possible mine strike in Chile. Members of the main union at Antofagasta Plc's Los Pelambres mine rejected the company's final wage offer, moving a step closer to a potential strike. The mine produced 372kt of copper last year.

184,How Oil Could Go To $100 Per Barrel,oilprice,"Mar 09, 2021",2021-03-09 21:00:00,"Tigther oil markets, and increasing OPEC influence on oil markets could mean that the cartel is keeping markets eager for more barrels, while boosting prices in the procress In its February Short Term Energy Outlook STEO, the EIA forecasts this month's world oil consumption at 96.7 million barrels per day mbpd. The oil supply, however, is much lower, only 93.6 mbpd, with the difference of 3.1 mbpd of necessity being drawn from crude oil and refined product inventories. By historical standards, a sustained draw of 3 mbpd is large, and we would expect prices to be rising under such circumstances.    The EIA sees demand continuing to recover at a good pace to mid-year, with July world oil consumption forecast at 98.2 mbpd but still about 4 mbpd below 'normal'. This incremental demand is being materially supplied by two sources, Brazil and OPEC. We might accept Brazil's crude oil production growth as given, allowing that the timing might be off by a month or two. The pivotal question is instead OPEC's intentions.  The EIA uses a volume or demand driven model, implying that OPEC will passively increase production to meet demand, and thereby keep oil prices low. But why would OPEC do this If OPEC simply maintained current production levels, the world would be 3.5 mbpd short of supply by mid-year.A shortfall of 3.5 mbpd -- 3.6% of global consumption -- is a lot.It would rapidly drain remaining excess inventories, leaving only oil prices to mediate between supply and demand just as the world economy is showing both strength and momentum as the pandemic ends. In other words, in the coming months consumers will be prepared to compete for the available barrels of oil, and that should push oil prices up sharply.  Related Video Can Saudis Defend Aramco from Houthis  That's the '$100 / barrel' thesis.  A few important notes and caveats. In many cases, operators must commit to producing barrels before they know what the price will be. In this case, OPEC can let prices rise and add barrels at its discretion. This provides OPEC a great deal of control and flexibility over oil prices. Certainly, higher oil prices are better, but more barrels can be added on fairly short notice if OPEC believes the market is overheating. This should encourage OPEC to test ever higher price levels.  And of course, Middle East politics are convoluted. The complex interplay of Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United States can produce unexpected results. Were Iran more collected, it could probably bring the US back toward some sort of deal in short order, thereby freeing Tehran to increase oil exports and push down oil prices. On the other hand, the Houthi attack on Saudi oil facilities at the loading port of Ras Tanura may push the Saudis back into the US embrace and motivate the Kingdom to keep oil prices lower to curry favor with the Biden administration.  It is hard to know where the balance comes out. Nevertheless, now is OPEC's best opportunity to make real money in the short to medium term. They would be fools to let the opportunity slip by.

186,Oil shrugs off new attacks on global energy consumers,arabnews,"Mar 09, 2021",2021-03-09 09:15:44,"Joe McMonigle, secretary general of the International Energy Forum, hit the nail on the head with his reaction to Sundays attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities by groups backed by the Iranian government. Oil export installations, energy infrastructure and international shipping lanes all form a part of the critical foundation that keeps the world economy running smoothly, Short Url https://arab.news/577ub Joe McMonigle, secretary general of the International Energy Forum, hit the nail on the head with his reaction to Sundays attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities by groups backed by the Iranian government. Oil export installations, energy infrastructure and international shipping lanes all form a part of the critical foundation that keeps the world economy running smoothly, and any attack on such facilities anywhere in the world is an attack on energy consumers everywhere, he said. Thats right - the attacks were an assault not just on the Saudi Aramco production facilities that were their ostensible targets, but also on energy consumers, which means everybody in the world. We all use energy, and oil remains the most important and widely used ingredient of the global energy mix. The Saudi Ministry of Energy made a similar point in its own statement, when it said the attacks not only target the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but also the security and stability of energy supplies to the world, and therefore the global economy. When a similar assault was launched on Aramco facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais in September 2019, it led to the biggest one-day fall in global oil production in history, sharp volatility in the International crude markets, and wild gyrations on the worlds stock exchanges. Only the rapid and efficient reaction of Saudi Aramco, returning capacity to pre-attack levels in a matter of weeks, prevented those attacks from causing serious and lasting damage to the global economy. Thankfully, the most recent attacks were unsuccessful in their aim, having apparently been intercepted by the Kingdoms defense forces. But it is another sinister escalation of the cycle of targeting Saudi energy facilities in a deliberate tactic to cause damage to its economic lifeblood. Ras Tanura, target of one of the attacks, is one of the largest oil refining and shipping ports in the world, and any interruption of business there would have an immediate effect on the Kingdoms economy. Especially worrying in the Sunday attacks was the apparent targeting of Aramco residential facilities in Dhahran in Eastern Province by missiles which came from the Arabian Gulf, according to the Ministry of Energy account of the attacks. Neither attack had any significant effect on lives or livelihoods, but oil analysts immediately rushed to assess what they meant for global crude markets that are only just beginning to recover from the battering they received during the pandemic recession of 2021. Brent crude spiked above $70 for the first time in 14 months as traders considered the possibility of disruption to global supplies. The price surrendered some of that gain as they decided there was not that much to worry about after all. The global oil market is in pretty good health, notwithstanding the collapse of 2020, and not least because of Saudi Arabias leading role in the OPEC+ alliance of producers. Last weeks decision by OPEC+ to roll over the supply cuts credited with restoring market balance, led by an extension of the Kingdoms one million barrel per day voluntary cut, was a sign that there is sufficient oil on global markets to satisfy recovering, but unpredictable, demand. Refining margins, especially in the Asian markets that are Saudi Arabias main focus, are at their lowest for several years, indicating that basic demand is not strong enough to warrant a big increase in output levels. That time will probably come by late spring or early summer, on the assumption of increasing roll-out of vaccines and ongoing progress in re-opening big economies. There is a lot of spare capacity in global oil markets, not least in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which can react to any twitch on the demand line very quickly. With Brent trading around $70 and West Texas Intermediate around $65, there is also scope for some - probably limited - resumption of US shale production when demand recovers. None of this is to dismiss the serious and sinister nature of the recent attacks, nor the potential for a further escalation of regional tensions. But, for now, the oil market is in a sufficiently comfortable position to shrug off the damage.

WTI Crude price  the American benchmark  is currently hovering around $65 per barrel, while Brent Crude surged above the $70 per barrel ma Published Mar 9, 2021 8:20AM EST The decision of OPEC+ members to not boost crude supply for the next month, in contrast to market anticipation, sent oil price soaring. WTI Crude price  the American benchmark  is currently hovering around $65 per barrel, while Brent Crude surged above the $70 per barrel mark, at least for a brief period of time. This can excite investors in the upstream companies as high crude prices can boost the profit level, at least in the short term. However, the resultant long-term scenario might not be rosy for the companies. High crude prices during the quarter can lead to a sequential hike in profits for companies like ConocoPhillips COP and Hess Corporation HESthat have massive international upstream presence. Moreover, countries with oil-dependent budgets will consider the current price environment favorable. However, economies with high oil-importing activities will face the brunt of the price hike. Economic growth of nations like India and China, which are two of the major oil demand growth drivers, can choke due to the higher prices. Affected Parties The economies recovering from the coronavirus pandemic can counter inflationary pressure due to the higher oil prices. Countries like the United States will have to pay higher prices for imported goods. The immediate effect of the soaring price will be a jump in fuel prices, which in turn will affect consumption-led recovery in oil demand. The environment is likely to create boundaries for consumers in a price-sensitive market. Moreover, high crude prices imply increased input costs for refining and marketing companies like PBF Energy Inc. PBF Valero Energy Corporation VLOand others.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies shocked the market on Thursday when they opted to keep output curbs largely in place, belying expectations that they would pump more crude to meet rising demand. Benchmark Brent futures jumped toward $70 a barrel at the end of the week. The market is telling us that OPEC+ have control, Mike Muller, Vitols head of Asia, said Sunday in an online forum hosted by consultant Gulf Intelligence.

Read more: OPEC+ Squeezes Oil Production Tight to Protect Price Recovery Oil producers and traders were left reeling last year after the coronavirus pandemic wiped out a third of energy demand, dragging down prices. Surplus crude flooded into storage, swelling stockpiles to the point where U.S. futures dropped below zero. OPEC+ has since implemented unprecedented production cuts, returning prices to pre-pandemic levels. Its decision to maintain output restrictions to support prompt prices -- the cost of barrels sold in the coming months -- indicates the group aims to cut into that mass of stored oil by undersupplying the market. Key OPEC+ member Russia previously voiced concerns that such a move would allow rival drillers in the U.S. to seize market share. Yet shale producers are unlikely to ramp up output, Muller said. U.S. rig counts are still nowhere close to supporting the U.S. returning to anywhere like the 13 million barrels a day we closed 2019 at, he said. Muller spoke Sunday before Saudi Arabia said it had thwarted drone and missile attacks on some of its facilities. Brent crude surged past $70 a barrel in early trading on Monday before erasing gains.

189,The Crisis Isn't Over For Oil Refiners,oilprice,"Mar 08, 2021",2021-03-08 01:00:00,"Oil demand continues to recover in the first half of 2021, and while this may seem good news for refiners, some smaller and older refineries continue to struggle to make ends meet as refining margins fail to improve Refiners and integrated oil firms continue to struggle with low refining margins, as a part of global oil demandjet fuel consumptionis still enormously depressed by international travel restrictions.  Margins for middle distillates, which include jet fuel, have improved since the worst effect of the pandemic last year. But the crisis in the airline industry and the pressure on refiners to curb jet fuel supply amid still very low demand could accelerate permanent closures of refineries geared to produce more middle distillates than gasoline, especially in Europe and Asia.  New refinery capacity in the Middle East and Asia also pressures older refineries, which yield more middle distillates, into risking permanent closures due to unprofitable or uncompetitive low-profit-margin operations. A current glut of diesel supply in Asia also depresses margins, while crude oil prices above $65 a barrel make raw materials more expensive.  The COVID-19 shock to oil demand has already resulted in idled capacity and permanent closures of refineries worldwide, including in the United States. Even with closures of 1.7 million bpd capacity announced by November 2020, there remains significant structural overcapacity, the International Energy Agency IEA said at the end of last year.  More refinery closures are in the cards, analysts say, given the newly built capacity and the loss of jet fuel demand which is not expected to recover to pre-COVID levels until 2023.  Sure, refining margins have increased in recent months compared to the worst from the spring of 2020, as Reuters market analyst John Kemp says.  Related Video Goldman Calls $70 Oil in Q2, But Jet Fuel Is The Joker  Good to see refining margins improve here in January a little bit, strengthening a little bit, which is good, but still a long ways off what historical numbers would be, BPs chief executive Bernard Looney said on the Q4 earnings call last month.  Yet, the current crisis is an existential threat to smaller and less efficient refineries in Europe and Asia that were struggling to turn profits even before the pandemic.  Even oil majors acknowledge that some sites have become permanently uneconomical amid depressed refining margins, fierce regional competition, and expectations of declining road fuel demand in the long term.  For example, ExxonMobil and BP announced in the span of just a few months closures of their respective refineries in Australia. They now plan to convert them into fuel import terminals.  Due to its geographical position, Australia has lost the competition in the refining business as small and old refineries cannot rival the booming oil processing capacity in Asia, particularly China and India.  Globally, refining faces a toughand potentially longway to recovery, said Wood Mackenzies Vice President Oils Research, Ann-Louise Hittle, and Alan Gelder, Vice President Refining, Chemicals & Oil Markets.  Refinery closures or restructuring were a key feature of 2020 across Europe, Asia and the Americas, but did little to lift margins in the face of the collapse in demand, they wrote in January. WoodMacs experts see refinery utilization levels globally staying low this year, so the threat of refinery rationalisation remains.  This year, more than 1 million bpd of refining capacity is expected to be completed in the Middle East and Asia, and these newly-built sites might prompt further rationalization in Europe and across Asia, according to WoodMac.  In Europe, 1.4 million bpd of refining capacity is under serious threat of closure by 2023 at the latest, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis from the middle of last year.  From Europe to Asia and the Americas, smaller and older refineries could fall victims to the structural overcapacity exacerbated by the COVID crisis. Newer and larger refineries integrated with petrochemicals could pose too overwhelming competition for smaller sites in the post-pandemic oil demand patterns.

190,Attack on Saudi Oil Site Sends Prices Up,manufacturing,"Mar 08, 2021",2021-03-08 00:00:00,"The threats to the global oil supply are taking place with economists expecting energy demand to surge as nations recover from the pandemic. Smoke rises after Saudi-led airstrikes on an army base in Sanaa, Yemen. The airstrikes come as retaliation for recent attacks on Saudi Arabia that were claimed by the Iranian-backed rebels. AP Photo/Hani Mohammed BANGKOK (AP)  Oil prices rose Monday as Saudi Arabian oil facilities were targeted by drone strikes just days after the largest crude exporting nations in the world said they would not increase output. Brent crude, the international standard, surpassed $70 per barrel for the first time in over a year, gaining $1.14 to $70.47 a barrel. It surged $2.62 on Friday. Benchmark U.S. crude oil added $1.10 to $67.19 per barrel, up 1.7 percent, falling back from bigger gains earlier in the day. It jumped $2.26 to $66.09 per barrel on Friday. Crude prices have surged more than 30 percent this year as massive vaccinations campaigns gain momentum, potentially signaling the beginning of the end of a global pandemic. The attacks in Saudi Arabia follow a devastating winter freeze in Texas and other parts of the southern United States last month knocked out production of roughly four million barrels per day of U.S. oil, pushing prices above $60 a barrel for the first time in more than a year. The threats to the global oil supply are taking place with economists expecting energy demand to surge as nations recover from the pandemic. In that environment, many energy analysts had expected the OPEC cartel and its allies to lift more restrictions and let the oil flow more freely. But OPEC, rattled by plunging prices over the past year, chose not to open the spigots, sending prices higher still. The strikes on Saudi sites have increased in frequency and precision in recent weeks, raising concerns about Saudi Arabia's air defenses and the expanding capabilities of the Iran-backed rebels across the border in Yemen. A Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign on war-torn Yemen's capital and on other provinces Sunday in retaliation for missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia that were claimed by the Iranian-backed rebels. The official Saudi Press Agency quoted an anonymous official in the Ministry of Energy as saying that a drone flew in from the sea and struck an oil storage site in Ras Tunura, the port run by Saudi Arabia's state oil company, Aramco. It claimed the strike did not cause any damage. Saudi Aramco, the kingdom's oil giant that now has a sliver of its worth traded publicly on the stock market, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ministry of Energy denounced the strike as ""an act of sabotage"" targeting not only Saudi Arabia ""but also the security and stability of energy supplies to the world."" When key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia were attacked in 2019, global energy prices soared 14 percent the next day. But that prior attack disrupted more than half of its daily exports, halting five percent of world crude oil output. Costlier oil pushes energy costs higher. That would add to inflation at a time when investors have been focusing on the potential for rising prices to cause central banks to raise interest rates that have been taken to record low levels to support economies battered by the pandemic. ""The last thing anyone wants in a recovering global economy is higher oil prices, and we are likely nearing a point when higher oil prices become a negative rather than a positive influence over risk assets,"" Stephen Innes of Axi said in a report Monday. Rising prices are a boon, however, for the oil industry, which has lost billions of dollars during the pandemic. Oil prices crashed as millions of people stayed home and avoided traveling, hoping to avoid infection. Oil futures briefly traded below $0 a barrel last spring before settling around $40 a barrel for months, well below what most producers needed to survive. Many U.S. producers cut production dramatically, others filed for bankruptcy protection. Workers lost jobs by the thousands. Eventually, prices began to recover as demand trickled back. In January, after Saudi Arabia announced it would cut production by one million barrels per day on top of cuts the kingdom already made through its agreement with the OPEC cartel, prices for U.S. benchmark crude pushed above $50 a barrel. The upswing continued through February, when Saudi Arabia's cuts went into effect. Natural resources consultancy Wood Mackenzie reports it is forecasting that oil prices will trade in the $70-$75 range in April and that global demand will increase in 2021 by 6.3 million barrels a day from a year earlier.

FILE. Letter writer says, 'We are between a rock and a hard place. We must not waste time and money developing infrastructure for a fuel that is not carbon-free.' (Getty Images) Stocktrek The revelation that a member of the Climate Action Council is a strong advocate for utilizing fossil gas is jarring (Theres a role for natural gas in the renewable energy future,"" March 2). Gavin Donohue, President and CEO, Independent Power Producers of New York, paints a pretty picture of New York running on gas power plants. He refers to this dirty fossil fuel as clean and natural. Most natural gas is extracted from the ground via fracking, which pollutes soil and water. Transport of this fuel is through pipelines, which can leak methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. Compressor stations that push the gas through the pipelines are noisy and can leak. Sadly, they also are often positioned near disadvantaged communities. When burned for energy, clean and natural gas contributes to our disrupted climate. The role of the Climate Action Council is to build the framework for moving New York toward clean energy, according to the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. As a frequent attendee of these meetings, I have been impressed with the progress. The members are working hard to power our great state with truly clean energy. Years ago, gas was considered to be a vital bridge to renewable energy for the future. Many coal plants were converted to gas but, in hindsight, we have realized the inherent problems. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations climate expert panel, we have about a decade to dramatically reduce harmful emissions.

Canadian Natural Resources, Suncor Energy, and Syncrude will all idle an upgrader each, taking off 250,000 bpd, 130,000 bpd, and 70,000 bpd, respectively, from total oil sands production.  The maintenance coincides with OPECs decision to leave its production level almost unchanged, save for a concession of 130,000 bpd for Russia and 20,000 bpd for Kazakhstan.  Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, said it will continue cutting 1 million bpd unilaterally this month as well, even though earlier there were reports it was going to end it as planned. Now, the Kingdom said it will keep cutting this month and next.

Russias Deputy Prime Minister and OPEC negotiator Alexander Novak said the oil market was in much better shape, as per a Financial Times report, but noted that the pandemic still presented a big uncertainty.  The oil sands cut will be temporary but, according to the industry itself, even when the three companies resume operations at their upgraders, there is little upward production growth pressure in Canadian oil sands. It seems emission reduction is a bigger priority for oil sands operators than production growth.  I cant see much growth in the oil sands happening because there is going to be less demand in the future, Canadian Natural Resources chief executive Tim McKay told Bloomberg.

The companies, including National Grid , Cadent Gas and Scottish Power have been told by Ofgemthat they must halve the financial returns they generate from their monopolies on parts of the nations energy infrastructure. Ofgem says the companies business model is low-risk and the returns should reflect that. Cutting the profits extracted by networks would mean lower bills for millions of households. The networks argue that slashing their profits would mean less money to invest in making the UKs energy supply greener. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will decide whether to grant the companies permission to appeal within two weeks. It will then have six months to determine whether Ofgem's proposals can go ahead. Read more Ignore whining energy companies, Ofgem is right to cap their returns The CMA said: The appeals largely focus on the allowed return on investment and the way Ofgem calculated the costs the companies would spend on maintaining and investing in their networks over the next five years. Energy companies reacted strongly against Ofgem's proposals as they were first released in July.

196,How Far Would More Efficient EVs Go With Oil Extraction Energy?,insideevs,"Mar 05, 2021",2021-03-05 13:27:52,"After a video exposed how much energy is spent in oil extraction, we calculated how far the Lucid Air, Aptera, and Nimbus Halo would travel with it. Gustavo Henrique Ruffo Welcome the Lucid Air, Aptera, and Nimbus Halo to the stage. With the energy required for a pump jack to extract oil from the ground in one month, a Tesla Model 3would be able to run for almost three years. This is what Mark Linthicum revealed in his open-source video to debunk the lie that an EV can be as pollutant as an ICE car That made us curious: what if that energy was used by more efficient EVs such as a Lucid Air an Aptera or a Nimbus Halo ? Lets answer that. Peter Rawlinson is very proud that Lucids first vehicle can achieve an energy efficiency of about 4.5 miles per kWh. Aptera believes its trike will achieve 10 miles per kWh, and Nimbus bets on 11 miles per kWh for the Halo. That said, the 9,960 kWh per month a single pump jack spends is enough for the Lucid Air to run 44,820 miles. According to PolicyAdvice Americans drive 13,474 miles per year on average. That means you could power your Air for three years and almost four months. For the record, the Model 3 could run 34,860 miles or about 10,000 miles less. Thats two years and close to seven months of driving. Take the Aptera and its 10 miles per kWh: it could travel 99,600 miles with what a pump jack spends in one month. That would be seven years and almost five months of driving. The Nimbus Halo would get 109,560 miles, or eight years and a little less than two months of use. Lets repeat: all that with what a pump jack spends in a month. This shows how important it is that electric cars keep improving their energy efficiency. If the current vehicles already make it obvious that EVs can be a sensible solution for energy usage, the future ones practically scream about how wrong it is to keep using oil. If you remember the video, there are 435,000 pump jacks in the US alone. In one month, they spend 4.3 TWh of energy (4,332,600,000 kWh). Just like the video did, it makes more sense to calculate how many cars that amount of electricity could power in a year. Running 13,474 miles per year, a Lucid Air would spend 2,994.2 kWh in that period. An Aptera and a Nimbus Halo need way less energy: 1,347.4 kWh and 1,224.9 kWh, respectively. If you calculate the average per month, the numbers are 249.5 kWh for the Air, 112.3 kWh for the Aptera, and 102.1 kWh for the Halo. The Lucid Air fleet that could be powered in a month by what all American pump jacks spend in the same period would have 17,363,841 cars. In a year, that energy could feed 1,446,987 Airs. The Model 3 fleet would include 15,164,100 vehicles or about 2.2 million units less in a month. When it comes to the Aptera, the 4.3 TWh would power 38,586,314 units in a month and 3,215,526 EVs in a year. The numbers for Nimbus Halo would be respectively 42,444,946 and 3,537,078 cars. Again, we are talking only about what the US spends with electricity on pump jacks in a month. The video also calculated the energy all 1,470 offshore drilling rigs in the world spend in a month: the equivalent to 13.23 TWh. That would power 53,022,117 Airs, 117,826,926 Apteras, and 129,609,619 Halos in a month. If we were talking about a year, the numbers would be 4,418,510 Lucids, 9,818,910 Apteras, and 10,800,801 Nimbuses. Add the 13.23 TWh to the 4.3 TWh, and you get 17.56 TWh  17,562,600,000 kWh, to be more precise. That amount of energy could power 5,865,497 Airs, 13,034,437, Apteras, and 14,337,880 Halos in a year. If we were to consider a month, all that electricity could charge 70,385,958 Lucids, 156,413,240 Apteras, and 172,054,564 Nimbuses. More Articles About EV Myths: Study Against EVs Backed By Legacy Automakers Is Debunked In Epic Way When you think that the US has a little more than 260 million cars, imagine if 70 million of them were Lucid Airs. Or if Nimbus managed to replace 172 million with Halos. Can you imagine the impact 70 million Apteras could have? Yes, these last two only carry two people, but why do they need room for four or five if you commute alone? Consider that the Halo will cost only $6,420, which might allow you to have a bigger car for the kids. These numbers make it even more urgent that the video is shared as much as possible. That places which still do not have a local translation get one. Help spread the message if you can, but remember to talk to Linthicum first ok?",https://insideevs.com/news/492351/range-efficient-evs-get-oil-extraction-energy/

The deal is expected to have a value of more than $30 billion, said the Wall Street Journal, which reported the talks earlier. Shares of both companies rose in pre-market U.S. trading on Monday.Between them, GE Capital Aviation Services, or Gecas, and AerCap have almost 3,000 aircraft owned, managed or on order. A combination would speed GE Chief Executive Officer Larry Culps push to streamline the U.S. industrial icon after an epic corporate meltdown.While terms of the potential agreement with AerCap are unclear, a sale of Gecas could garner GE about $25 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence said in a report in 2019. Last year, GE completed the sale of its bio-pharmaceutical business to Culps former employer, Danaher Corp., for $21.4 billion.Read: General Electric Has One Way to Fly Out of Trouble: GadflyA deal would also mark a significant consolidation in the leasing sector at a time of extreme uncertainty for aviation, said John Strickland, who runs London-based airline advisory firm JLS Consulting. The combined company would have greater negotiating clout with manufacturers like Boeing Co. and Airbus SE, while being able to focus on the strongest airline customers during the recovery, when many will remain reliant on lessors for financing flexibility. GE declined to comment, and AerCap representatives couldnt immediately be reached for comment outside regular business hours on Sunday.Aviation PainAerCap, based in Dublin and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has a market value of $6.6 billion. The shares jumped 8.2% to $54.99 in pre-market U.S. trading on Monday. GE advanced 2.9% to $13.99, adding to a 26% increase for the year through Friday.The pandemic has hammered the aviation industry and pushed airlines around the world to cancel new jetliner orders, push back delivery dates and defer lease payments. As middlemen, aircraft leasing firms have suffered too, while also playing a critical financing role to keep deliveries flowing, often with sale-leaseback deals that hand cash to airlines with jet handovers.But a combination of two major players would be likely to receive scrutiny from antitrust authorities, other regulators and business partners, given the weight of the two companies in the sector. For GE, a tie-up would extend a shift away from the companys longtime business model of using its powerful leasing platform to generate sales of commercial aircraft powered by the companys jet engines. GEs finance arm has been significantly pared back since it nearly crippled the company during the 2008 financial crisis.The old world where you needed a leasing a company to support your manufacturing is gone, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson said. For AerCap, this could be something thats too good to refuse.Culp has been shedding assets in recent years as part of his broader turnaround effort at GE after a collapse that wiped out a total of more than $200 billion in market value during 2017 and 2018. Under his leadership, the Gecas portfolio has been left in something akin to caretaker status, Ferguson said.Asset SalesIn 2019, GE agreed to sell an aircraft-financing business for $3.6 billion to Apollo Global Management and Athene Holding Ltd. as the ailing manufacturer slimmed down its once-vast lending arm. The same year, Culp sped up a plan to sell off GEs stake in oilfield-services provider Baker Hughes in a push to refocus GEs once-sprawling industrial businesses.The asset sales have raised critical cash that GE has used to repay its bloated debt load, one of Culps top priorities in his turnaround drive. The company has cut some $30 billion in debt since 2019, including $16 billion last year. GE had total borrowings of about $75 billion at the end of 2020.A deal with Gecas would likely elevate the profile of Aengus Gus Kelly, AerCaps hard-charging CEO. He emerged on the global stage in 2014 with AerCaps $7.6 billion acquisition of leasing pioneer ILFC from American International Group. By pooling assets, the new entity may be able to access the capital markets more cheaply than Gecas could acting under GEs corporate umbrella, Ferguson said.Gecas had about $35.9 billion i",http://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-soars-opec-surprise-energy-131701160.html

Energy markets were not spared the volatility either, with oil prices adding to big gains overnight after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) agreed to mostly maintain their supply cuts in April as they await a more solid recovery in demand affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Australian stocks shed more than 1 percent, Japans Nikkei share average dropped 1.6 percent and shares in Seoul fell 1.4 percent. Chinese shares were in the red with the blue-chip CSI300 index off by 1.5 percent. That sent MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan to 684.52, the lowest since February 1. E-Mini futures for the US S&P 500 index were 0.5 percent lower. US stocks dropped on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell disappointed some investors by not indicating that the US central bank might step up purchases of long-term bonds to hold down longer-term interest rates. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.1 percent, taking it down about 10 percent from its record close on February 12 and putting it in correction territory. Even though Powell made it clear that the Federal Reserve was not close to changing its ultra-loose monetary policy stance anytime soon, some analysts still worried that rising Treasury yields could herald higher borrowing costs, thereby limiting the fragile US economic recovery. The market was seemingly looking for Powell to push back harder on the recent increase in yields, said Ray Attrill, the head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank. Volatility seen in local interest rate markets yesterday with another large increase in long-term rates and government bond yields has set the scene for a choppy market again today if overnight developments are any guide. Rosier economic outlook Bond investors with a bearish view of US Treasury bond prices took heart in Powells remarks and sold the notes. The yield on 10-year Treasuries climbed above 1.5 percent to as high as 1.5727 percent, but still below a one-year high of 1.614 percent struck last week. Bond yields rise as their prices fall. The yield curve, a measure of economic expectations, steepened on rising yields, with the gap between two- and 10-year yields widening by another 6.3 basis points overnight. US 2s-10s yield curve [Bloomberg] Rising Treasury yields bolstered demand for the US dollar. The dollar index jumped to a three-month high of 91.734. The stronger US dollar hobbled the Japanese yen. By early Friday, the yen fell to as low as 107.97 per dollar, the lowest since July 1 though it pared back some of those losses and was last at 107.85. The euro was also tripped by the firmer dollar, with the common European currency sluggish at $1.1960. Climbing yields and dollar strength pummelled gold prices, which sank to a nine-month low as investors sold the precious metal to reduce the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset. Spot gold slid another 0.2 percent early Friday to $1,692.26 per ounce, trading below $1,700 for the first time since June 2020. Oil prices extended gains on early Friday after zooming higher overnight. US crude futures climbed 17 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $64, holding below a 13-month high hit on Thursday.

200,States sue to undo Biden pause on US oil and gas lease sales,aljazeera,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 23:02:16,"The 13 Republican-leaning states seek a court order ending the moratorium that President Biden imposed in January. whatsapp Thirteen states sued the administration of United States President Joe Biden on Wednesday to end a suspension of new oil and gas leases on federal land and water and to reschedule cancelled sales of leases in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska waters and western states. The Republican-leaning states, led by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, seek a court order ending the moratorium imposed after Biden, a Democrat, signed executive orders on climate change on January 27. The suit specifically seeks an order that the government go ahead with a sale of oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico that had been scheduled for March 17 until it was cancelled; and a lease sale that had been planned for this year in Alaskas Cook Inlet. And it calls for other suspended lease sales to go forward. Sales also have been postponed for federal lands in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Montana, Oklahoma, Nevada and New Mexico. Biden and multiple federal agencies bypassed comment periods and other bureaucratic steps required before such delays can be undertaken, the states claim in the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in the federal courts Western District of Louisiana. The lawsuit notes that coastal states receive significant revenue from onshore and offshore oil and gas activity. Stopping leases, the lawsuit argues, would diminish revenue that pays for Louisiana efforts to restore coastal wetlands, raise energy costs and lead to major job losses in oil-producing states. At a news conference, Landry accused the Biden administration of effectively banning oil and gas activity that supports businesses, employees our workers and, also, as importantly, funds our coastal restoration projects. Although Landry and the lawsuits supporters said the moratorium has already driven up prices and endangered energy jobs, Bidens suspension doesnt stop companies from drilling on existing leases. But a long-term halt to oil and gas sales would curb future production and could hurt states like Louisiana that are heavily dependent on the industry. Bidens team has argued that companies still have plenty of undeveloped leases  almost 14 million acres (6 million hectares) in western states and more than 9 million acres (3.6 million hectares) offshore. Companies also have about 7,700 unused drilling permits  enough for years. This will not affect oil and gas production or jobs for years to come, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said when asked about the lawsuits claims at a Wednesday briefing. Administration officials have declined to say how long the pause on lease sales will last. Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia are the other plaintiff states.

Oil drilling in the Uina Basin near Vernal. Utah joined a dozen other states in a lawsuit against the federal government challenging the Jan. 27 executive order to ban any new oil and gas leasing on federal land. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News SALT LAKE CITY  Utah joined a dozen other states Wednesday in a lawsuit against the federal government challenging the Jan. 27 executive order issued by President Joe Biden to ban any new oil and gas leasing on federal land and offshore waters. The suit led by Louisiana challenges the executive order on the grounds that it violates mandatory provisions of a pair of federal laws requiring lease sales be held to further oil and gas development in the United States. The Biden administrations unlawful moratorium on federal land leasing threatens Utahs oil and gas industry, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said. Not only does the industry add billions of dollars to Utahs economy each year, it also supports over 32,000 jobs in Utah. Revenue from oil and gas leases and royalties help fund schools and local governments, as well as health, safety and environmental projects across the state. Without any explanation, President Bidens order stops leases in violation of federal law. Bidens executive order, the suit asserts, is in flagrant disregard of the Interior Departments nondiscretionary statutory duties when it comes to provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and Mineral Leasing Act, which establish timelines for the development of oil and natural gas resources on federal public lands and waters. Those leases do more than allow America to reach its full energy-production potential they provide significant environmental benefits because portions of the lease proceeds are invested into vital state environmental defense and restoration projects, the suit reads. Related Biden wants to end new oil and gas leasing: What does that mean for Utah? In fact, the suit blasts the Biden administration for the ecological consequences that will result from the action. Executive Order 14008 glistens with irony. It purports to protect the environment, but it constitutes what is likely the single-largest divestment of revenue for environmental protection projects in American history. Challengers to the ban point out that each year the federal government returns billions of dollars to the states for environmental reclamation projects that are funded with proceeds from federal oil and gas leases. The lawsuit details the economic harm Utah will suffer, including: $58.6 million it gets from federal leases. $124.4 million in natural resources property taxes assessed by counties. $33.2 million in severance taxes. $3.7 million in oil and gas conservation fees. The lawsuit contends that not only does the ban knock federal lands out of new oil and gas investment by industry, but it spills over to significant and consequential impacts to private and state trust lands. A moratorium on federal leasing discourages investment from oil and gas companies in leasing or developing state sections when the companies cannot also lease the federal land surrounding the state acreage. Accordingly, lost investment in federal leases results in lost investment in state leases, depriving Utah and Utah schools of state mineral leasing, production and tax revenues, it reads. The states litigation follows lawsuits launched by the earlier this year and widespread praise from environmental and conservation groups who say reforms are long overdue. Bidens Interior Department is hosting a briefing on the moratorium on Thursday. Other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia.

Save (The Center Square)  Wyoming filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Biden administration over its moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Wyoming, alleges that the U.S. Department of Interior violated federal law by not taking public input before implementing the executive order that halted new lease sales. President Joe Biden signed the executive order on Jan. 27 as part of his administrations aggressive efforts to curb climate change and prioritizing green energy. The lawsuit comes after a quarterly federal oil and gas lease sale for March was postponed, alleging that move violated the Mineral Leasing Act. The lawsuit also alleges state government and the public were denied an opportunity to participate in the decision-making process in violation of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. Wyoming gets 48% of royalties and revenue from development of federal lands, which the state uses to fund schools, roads, and state and local governments, the lawsuit noted.

The announcement is questionable given the governments pledge to cut carbon emissions, the Guardianreports. The government has struck a joint investment deal worth 16 billion to help support 40,000 North Sea jobs. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 50 per cent by the end of the decade. Furthermore, the government will introduce a new mechanism which they call a climate compatibility checkpoint. The checkpoint will be used to determine whether new oil and gas exploration applications are compatible with the U.K.s climate change objectives. The North Sea deal sends a clear message around the world that the U.K. will be a nation of clean energy, said Kwasi Kwarteng, the governments business and energy secretary. He added that the U.K. will not leave oil and gas workers behind in the irreversible shift away from fossil fuels. Climate activists have expressed dismay over the governments decision to continue granting leases. This is a colossal failure. The U.K. will make a fool of itself in the run-up to hosting the COP26 global climate talks if our energy minister signs off on new oil and gas licences that serve to rip up the Paris Agreement (the world deal to hold global temperature rise to 1.5C) said Mel Evans from Greenpeace.

On Tuesday, the Minnesota Court of Appeals began hearings on Enbridges Line 3 replacement project located in the northern part of the state, which received a construction stormwater permit in December. Opponents, which include several First Nations and environmental groups, argued Enbridge has failed to show long-term need for the Line 3 project. According to Katherine Hinderlie, an attorney for the Minnesota Department of Commerce, Minnesotas independent Public Utilities Commission granted Enbridge a certificate of need after the Calgary-based energy company demonstrated demand to transport crude oil, but not demand for the crude oil itself. The demanders of crude oil are refineries, and therefore the department believes you should look to refinery demand for crude oil, Hinderlie said. The Associated Presshas more.

207,State sues administration to reverse oil and gas leasing moratorium,gillettenewsrecord,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 16:10:00,"Wyoming is taking its objection to President Joe Bidens moratorium on issuing oil and gas leases on federal lands to the courts. Save Wyoming is taking its objection to President Joe Bidens moratorium on issuing oil and gas leases on federal lands to the courts. Gov. Mark Gordon has announced the state filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the move ordered by Biden in his first days in office and implemented by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. In a Wednesday morning press release announcing the lawsuit, Gordon said the lawsuit assets that implementing the moratorium violates federal law. Following a careful review of not only the presidents executive order, but tis practical effect, it is necessary for Wyoming to protect its citizens and challenge the secretarys actions, Gordon says in the announcement. Not only is this federal action overreaching, it was implemented without public input as required under federal law. The moratorium was among the first raft of executive orders Biden made after his Jan. 20 inauguration. Many of the orders focused on fossil fuels and the president's campaign promises to eliminate them in the U.S. within the next decade. Along with halting all federal leases for oil and gas, he also rescinded the permit for continued construction of the 1,200-mile Keystone XL oil pipeline between Canada and the United States. Wednesdays lawsuit was filed in the Federal District Court of Wyoming and claims the moratorium violates the National Environmental Policy Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, the Mineral Leasing Act and the Federal Land Policy Act. It asks the federal court to set aside Haalands decision to implement the leasing ban and that the Bureau of Land Management be allowed to resume its quarterly oil and gas lease sales. A scheduled first quarter sale for federal oil and gas leases in Wyoming has already been postponed because of the moratorium. The governor emphasized that the presidents de-facto ban on oil and gas leasing will not meet the climate goals on the administration, as production will simply shift to other countries with less stringent emissions standards, according to the press release. The world will continue to need and use oil and gas for the foreseeable future, Gordon said. The question is whether it will be produced under the environmental safeguards in place on federal lands in Wyoming, or overseas without equally stringent regulations. Gordon said he anticipates other states will consider intervening in support of Wyomings lawsuit. Wednesdays filling isnt the first legal action taken in response to Bidens executive orders targeting fossil fuel energy. Wyoming is one of 21 states that have signed on to a lawsuit filed last week seeking to overturn the Keystone XL pipeline decision. The Keystone project was authorized by Congress and would provide economic benefits to multiple states, including Wyoming, Gordon said in a press release last week. Its foolish to think cancelling this pipeline does anything good for the country or climate. It will merely shift production offshore to places with lower environmental standards, worse safety records and laxer workforce protections, while at the same time undermining our own domestic energy security. Lets put America first because we do it right.",https://www.gillettenewsrecord.com/news/local/article_177c1e63-dfbf-5f33-b156-5c1559be859d.html

210,UK Government criticised over plans to drill more North Sea oil and gas,insider,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 08:01:45,"The deal will see 40,000 jobs saved across the sector, while aiming to cut pollution privacy notice Environmental campaigners have criticised the UK Government's plan to drill for more oil and gas in the North Sea as part of a deal to transition away from fossil fuels, while safeguarding jobs and the economy. Greenpeace said the move would be a colossal failure for the UK and Scottish Governments net-zero emissons commitments. The environmental group argued that the government should refuse new licenses, as enough fossils fuels have been found to ruin the climate already. However, government ministers insist the strategy will introduce a new climate compatibility checkpoint before approving future oil and gas licenses, to ensure they align with wider climate objectives. The new checkpoints will use the latest evidence looking at domestic demand for oil and gas with the increasing prevalence of clean technologies, such as hydrogen production, offshore wind farms and carbon capture. The North Sea Transition Deal should support 40,000 jobs across the supply chain, while claiming to be cutting pollution up to 60 million tonnes by 2030. The UK Government also confirmed taxpayers will no longer be supporting the fossil fuel sector overseas after 31 March. The sector will face targets to reduce emissions by 10% by 2025 and 25% by 2027 and has committed to cut emissions by 50% by 2030. Help will be provided to the industry to transition from fossil fuels with a joint government and oil and gas sector investment of up to 16bn by 2030 to reduce carbon emissions. The funding will include up to 3bn to replace fossil fuel-based power supplies on oil and gas platforms with renewable energy, up to 3bn on Carbon Capture Usage and Storage, and up to 10bn for hydrogen production.

211,Government refuses to rule out new oil and gas licences in North Sea deal,independent,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 07:15:18,"Long-awaited deal between government and oil and gas sector a missed opportunity to show climate leadership in the year of Cop26, say campaigners Thanks for signing up to the Climate newsletter From the Shetland Isles to Orkney and Peterhead to Falkirk, the oil and gas industry is the economic artery for many communities in Scotland, and we are doing everything possible to ensure that this vitally important sector is not left behind as we transition to a green economy. The government added that the full details of how this checkpoint will work are to be set out by the end of 2021. Previous analysis by Greenpeace found that any new oil and gas licences would not be in line with the UKs climate goals  if emissions from burning the fossil fuels were counted in addition to emissions caused by the extraction process. Mel Evans, head of Greenpeace UKs oil campaign, said: Refusal to rule out new oil and gas licences when the evidence is already clear that they are incompatible with UK climate commitments is a colossal failure in climate leadership in the year of Cop26. Instead of finding ways to prop up this volatile and polluting sector, a better proposition for workers and communities would be for the government to confirm a ban on new licences, and put all its energies into a nationwide programme of retraining, reskilling and investment in renewables and green infrastructure. The decision comes just months after Denmark announcedplans to end all oil and gas offshore activities in the North Sea by 2050. Ryan Morrison, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the governments refusal to rule out new oil and gas licences exposed the outrageous hypocrisy in its approach to tackling the climate crisis. The science on this is already crystal clear: burning fossil fuels is the key driver of this crisis, so to avoid climate breakdown there can be no new licenses and existing production must be wound down over the next decade  a new climate compatibility checkpoint isnt going to change that reality, he said. Dr Jonathan Marshall, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a non-profit based in London, added: For a government usually so keen to set targets, the absence of an end date for extracting fossil fuels from the North Sea is a glaring omission. It is clear that the energy future of our seas is renewable. A bold announcement on ending oil and gas extraction in the North Sea while supporting jobs and workers through the transition would have made waves comparable to plans to stop generating electricity from coal and ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars.

212,Analysis: Bidens oil and gas leasing pause will not curtail LWCFs conservation obligations,csindy,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 07:00:00,"On the same day that President Joe Biden signed an executive order which, in the face of climate change, called for a pause on new oil and gas leases on Black Canyon Kent Raney / Shutterstock.com On the same day that President Joe Biden signed an executive order which, in the face of climate change, called for a pause on new oil and gas leases on federal land and the reassessment of the leasing system, Western Energy Alliance denounced the order as a threat to the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Fortunately, the concern by oil and gas trade association WEA for the underfunding of LWCF is totally unfounded and, frankly, a red herring. LWCF, for those who may not know, is the most successful conservation program in the United States. Enacted by Congress in 1965, the program is responsible for protecting Americas irreplaceable lands and waters and ensuring that all Americans have access to outdoor recreation. The primary source of income to the fund is fees and royalties paid to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement by companies drilling offshore in federal water for oil and gas. In August 2020, the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) was signed into law, guaranteeing that LWCF will be funded at $900 million per year. This was a historic moment for protecting public lands, and certainly the Continental Divide Trail, since LWCF funds have played an integral part toward completion of the trail, where some sections are forced off public lands. All told, GAOA directs $1.3 billion annually in oil and gas leasing and production revenue toward conservation. But none of that funding is impacted by any proposals to limit new leases. A review of the Department of the Interiors Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and Office of Natural Resource Revenue websites reveals that the pause will have zero effect on LWCF funding. The drilling scenario on the Outer Continental Shelf, even with no new leasing, shows that vast areas are untapped and remain available for new production  77 percent of the existing shelf leases (1,752) have never been drilled. Pull Quote Public lands protections that LWCF provides are also an investment in Colorado communities. Moreover, every year revenue from existing lease production far exceed amounts needed for full funding of LWCF. Over the past two decades, Outer Continental Shelf production has brought an annual average of just over $6 billion into the U.S. Treasury. Legally required deposits to LWCF plus all other obligations total about $1.5 billion each year, leaving about $4.5 billion in surplus Outer Continental Shelf Treasury revenue after all obligations are met. Even the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2020 shelf revenue has not affected funds for LWCF and other obligations, with more than $2.5 billion remaining in the Treasury after all disbursements were made. In Colorado, LWCF has already funded dozens of sites where Coloradans and visitors may recreate outdoors and learn about culture and history along the Continental Divide. Iconic places like Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, and Browns Canyon National Monument are just a few of the locations that could have been lost to incompatible development forever if not for these funds. PhotoStock10 / Shutterstock.com Public lands protections that LWCF provides are also an investment in Colorado communities. Gateway communities along the Continental Divide Trail, as well as many other towns and local businesses across the West, depend upon conservation protections to ensure the pristine outdoor experiences that attract throngs of nature lovers and recreationists. The coronavirus pandemic has reminded us how important being able to get outside is for reconnection and recharging. Bidens moratorium is meant to begin to fix our broken oil and gas leasing system, so that we may better address the damaging impact of oil and gas drilling on the environment and climate, and ensure we all have opportunities to recreate on our public lands. Given the critical importance of land conservation in tackling the dual climate and nature crises, we no doubt need to prioritize investments in conservation and recreation and ease up on energy dominance policies that unwisely downplayed the dangers of climate change. In the meantime, as we make this transition, the numbers show that there remain enough existing drilling permits to allow oil and gas companies to operate for years, and we can rest assured that the Land and Water Conservation Fund will continue to protect Americas great outdoors and cultural treasures.

213,Why is Biden halting federal oil and gas sales?,smdailyjournal,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 06:15:00,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP)  President Joe Biden shut down oil and gas lease sales from the nation's vast public lands and waters in his first days in office, citing worries Linkedin BILLINGS, Mont. (AP)  President Joe Biden  shut down oil and gas lease sales from the nation's vast public lands and waters in his first days in office, citing worries about climate change. Now his administration has to figure out what do with the multibillion-dollar program without crushing a significant sector of the U.S. economy  and while fending off sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and the oil industry. The leasing ban is only temporary, although officials have declined to say how long it will last. And it's unclear how much legal authority the government has to stop drilling on about 23 million acres (9 million hectares) previously leased to energy companies. Here are some questions hanging over Biden's Interior Department as it launches a months-long review of the government's petroleum sales with a virtual forum Thursday. WHY IS BIDEN TARGETING OIL AND GAS LEASE SALES? Burning of oil, gas and coal from government-owned lands and waters is a top source of U.S. emissions, accounting for 24% of the nation's greenhouse gases. Oil and gas account for the biggest chunk of human-caused fossil fuel emissions from federal lands following a drilling surge under former President Donald Trump. Emission reductions from a permanent leasing ban would be relatively small -- about 100 million tons (91 million metric tons) annually, or less than 1% of global fossil fuel emissions, according to a study by a nonprofit research group. But environmentalists and others who want more aggressive action against climate change say a ban would nudge the economy in a new direction. Biden wants to substitute fossil fuel production and consumption with policies that promote renewable energy on public lands, such as wind and solar power. ""The federal government is a huge player here. The government has market power,"" said attorney Max Sarinsky with New York University Law School's Institute for Policy Integrity. ""If you restrict the supply (of oil and gas), you alter the market and you create a better environment for more sustainable fuels."" Lease sales and royalties companies pay on extracted oil and gas brought in more than $83 billion in revenue over the past decade. Half the money from onshore drilling goes to the state where it occurred. Money from offshore drilling gets shared with states at a lesser rate and pays for a conservation fund used to preserve land nationwide. WHAT'S BEEN DONE SO FAR? The administration postponed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and Utah. Biden earlier had suspended leasing in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Interior officials say the fossil fuel program has failed to consider climate impacts and that irresponsible leasing practices carve up wildlife habitat, threaten Native American cultural and sacred sites and lock up public lands that could be used for recreation or conservation. After what they call a ""fire sale"" of public energy reserves under Trump, Biden's team argues that companies still have plenty of undeveloped leases  almost 14 million acres (6 million hectares) in western states and more than 9 million acres (3.6 million hectares) offshore. Companies also have  about 7,700 unused drilling permits  enough for years. Despite the moratorium, the Biden administration has continued to issue new permits for existing leases, including more than 200 in March, records show. Environmentalists want that to stop, but an outright drilling ban would raise thorny legal issues. Companies could claim they have the right to extract oil and gas after spending years and millions of dollars to secure leases. WHAT ARE BIDEN'S OPTIONS? A ban on new leases means drilling would fade out as existing ones expire. It would be a heavy blow for western and Gulf Coast states that heavily depend on oil and gas revenue to pay for schools, roads and other services. Another option is to increase royalty fees to reflect the ""social cost"" of climate change  damage from rising seas, drought, wildfires and other global warming impacts. That would keep revenue flowing and make it more expensive to drill on federal land, forcing companies to concentrate on the most profitable reserves and reducing emissions, though by less than a ban. ""If it's not possible to have a carbon tax on all oil and gas extraction, at least we could do something akin to that on public lands,"" said James Stock, a Harvard University economist and former member of the White House Council on Economic Advisers under Obama. HOW MANY JOBS COULD BE LOST? Economists say claims by industry groups and allies in Congress that a leasing ban would trigger massive job losses are greatly exaggerated. An industry-promoted University of Wyoming study projected almost 300,000 jobs lost by 2025. But historical data on energy jobs suggest a much smaller impact of about 60,000 jobs, said Jeremy Weber, former chief energy economist for Trump's White House Council of Economic Advisers and now a University of Pittsburgh associate professor That's still a significant number as the U.S. economy recovers from job losses in the pandemic. And even limited job losses could profoundly affect local economies in Wyoming, New Mexico and other oil-dependent states. There's also no guarantee such impacts would be offset by Biden's promise to deliver millions of new green energy jobs, such as installing solar panels or helping with environmental cleanups of abandoned oil wells and coal mines. Despite promises by renewable energy advocates, such jobs ""don't fill the bucket like oil and gas does,"" said Jim Willox, a commissioner in Converse County, Wyoming, the state's top crude producer and home to several new wind farms. Aware of such concerns, Biden climate adviser Gina McCarthy met with executives from Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other companies Monday to discuss ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A White House statement said the administration ""is not fighting the oil and gas sector"" and wants to create jobs while addressing emissions. American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said independent forecasts show natural gas and oil will provide about half of the global energy mix for decades to come. WHAT'S NEXT? Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, sworn in last week as the first Native American to oversee the nation's public lands and waters, will kick off Thursday's forum, which will include representatives of industry, labor, conservationist groups, Indigenous people and others. Haaland, a former two-term New Mexico congresswoman, said she wants to ""strike the right balance""  as Interior manages energy development while seeking to conserve public lands and address climate change. An interim report to be completed this summer will outline recommendations for Interior and Congress to overhaul the fossil fuels program. A similar review of government coal sales during the Obama administration was to last three years, but was canceled by Trump. ___ Daly reported from Washington, D.C. ___",https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/national/why-is-biden-halting-federal-oil-and-gas-sales/article_00b3eb3c-8c0f-11eb-8aa2-cbe18df9a581.html

The proposed InvIT will house some of the gas pipeline infrastructure created by the company. March 24, 2021, 08:04 IST New Delhi: After power, the country's oil sector PSUswould now float an infrastructure investment trust( InvIT ) as part of the asset monetisation exercise announced by the government and mobilise resources for fresh capital investment. As part of the exercise, gas transportation utility GailIndia is expected to set up the gust InvIT in the oil sector in the next financial year. The proposed InvIT will house some of the gas pipeline infrastructure created by the company. Oil ministry officials said that this will help Gail to mobilise over Rs 20,000 crore through this route that could be helpful in developing new pipeline infrastructure that would help the country in developing a gas-based economy. Two other oil public sector undertakings (PSUs), HPCL and IndianOil may also set up InvIT at a later stage. While Gail and HPCL will focus on monetising their pipeline infrastructure through the investment trusts, IndianOil proposes to do so in the case of its hydrogen-producing units as well as product pipelines that would be hived off into an InvIT. An InvIT is an investment vehicle created to hold income-generating and operational infrastructure assets such as roads, power transmission lines, and gas pipelines. These are like mutual funds and instead of financial securities InvITs hold bankable assets having long-term contracts with strong counterparties that provide a steady cash flow over the long term. The investment trust route may be new for the oil sector but power sector transmission utility PowerGridhas already put some of its assets for monetisation under the InvIT set up by it earlier. Other large PSUs will also be encouraged to take this route. Asset monetisation is an important aspect of the disinvestment exercise for FY22. Though this normally does not provide the Centrewith large gains on PSU assets, it helps the entries to start a fresh capex cycle based on fund mobilisation through the route.

216,EXPLAINER: Why is Biden halting federal oil and gas sales?,nownews,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 00:13:00,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP)  President Joe Biden shut down oil and gas lease sales from the nations vast public lands and waters in his first days in office, citing worries about climate change. Now his administration has to figure out what do with the multi-billion dollar program without crushing a significant sector of the U.S. [] Print BILLINGS, Mont. (AP)  President Joe Biden  shut down oil and gas lease salesfrom the nations vast public lands and waters in his first days in office, citing worries about climate change. Now his administration has to figure out what do with the multi-billion dollar program without crushing a significant sector of the U.S. economy  and while fending off sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and the oil industry. The leasing ban is only temporary, although officials have declined to say how long it will last. And its unclear how much legal authority the government has to stop drilling on about 23 million acres (9 million hectares) previously leased to energy companies. Here are some questions hanging over Bidens Interior Department as it launches a months-long review of the governments petroleum sales with a virtual forum Thursday. WHY IS BIDEN TARGETTING OIL AND GAS LEASE SALES? Burning of oil, gas and coal from government-owned lands and waters is a top source of U.S. emissions, accounting for 24% of the nations greenhouse gases. Oil and gas account for the biggest chunk of human-caused fossil fuel emissions from federal lands following a drilling surge under former President Donald Trump. Emission reductions from a permanent leasing ban would be relatively small  about 100 million tons (91 million metric tons) annually, or less than 1% of global fossil fuel emissions, according to a study by a nonprofit research group. But environmentalists and others who want more aggressive action against climate change say a ban would nudge the economy in a new direction. Biden wants to substitute fossil fuel production and consumption with policies that promote renewable energy on public lands, such as wind and solar power. The federal government is a huge player here. The government has market power, said attorney Max Sarinsky with New York University Law Schools Institute for Policy Integrity. If you restrict the supply (of oil and gas), you alter the market and you create a better environment for more sustainable fuels. Lease sales and royalties companies pay on extracted oil and gas brought in more than $83 billion in revenue over the past decade. Half the money from onshore drilling goes to the state where it occurred. Money from offshore drilling gets shared with states at a lesser rate and pays for a conservation fund used to preserve land nationwide. WHATS BEEN DONE SO FAR? The administration postponed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and Utah. Biden earlier had suspended leasing in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Interior officials say the fossil fuel program has failed to consider climate impacts and that irresponsible leasing practices carve up wildlife habitat, threaten Native American cultural and sacred sites and lock up public lands that could be used for recreation or conservation. After what they call a fire sale of public energy reserves under Trump, Bidens team argues that companies still have plenty of undeveloped leases  almost 14 million acres (6 million hectares) in western states and more than 9 million acres (3.6 million hectares) offshore. Companies also have  about 7,700 unused drilling permits  enough for years Despite the moratorium, the Biden administration has continued to issue new permits for existing leases, including more than 200 in March, records show. Environmentalists want that to stop, but an outright drilling ban would raise thorny legal issues. Companies could claim they have the right to extract oil and gas after spending years and millions of dollars to secure leases. WHAT ARE BIDENS OPTIONS? A ban on new leases means drilling would fade out as existing ones expire. It would be a heavy blow for western and Gulf Coast states that heavily depend on oil and gas revenue to pay for schools, roads and other services. Another option is to increase royalty fees to reflect the social cost of climate change  damage from rising seas, drought, wildfires and other global warming impacts. That would keep revenue flowing and make it more expensive to drill on federal land, forcing companies to concentrate on the most profitable reserves and reducing emissions, though by less than a ban. If its not possible to have a carbon tax on all oil and gas extraction, at least we could do something akin to that on public lands, said James Stock, a Harvard University economist and former member of the White House Council on Economic Advisers under Obama. HOW MANY JOBS COULD BE LOST? Economists say claims by industry groups and allies in Congress that a leasing ban would trigger massive job losses are greatly exaggerated. An industry-promoted University of Wyoming study projected almost 300,000 jobs lost by 2025. But historical data on energy jobs suggest a much smaller impact of about 60,000 jobs, said Jeremy Weber, former chief energy economist for Trumps White House Council of Economic Advisers and now a University of Pittsburgh associate professor Thats still a significant number as the U.S. economy recovers from job losses in the pandemic. And even limited job losses could profoundly affect local economies in Wyoming, New Mexico and other oil-dependent states. Theres also no guarantee such impacts would be offset by Bidens promise to deliver millions of new green energy jobs, such as installing solar panels or helping with environmental cleanups of abandoned oil wells and coal mines. Despite promises by renewable energy advocates, such jobs dont fill the bucket like oil and gas does, said Jim Willox, a commissioner in Converse County, Wyoming, the states top crude producer and home to several new wind farms. Aware of such concerns, Biden climate adviser Gina McCarthy met with executives from Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other companies Monday to discuss ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A White House statement said the administration is not fighting the oil and gas sector and wants to create jobs while addressing emissions. American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said independent forecasts show natural gas and oil will provide about half of the global energy mix for decades to come. WHATS NEXT? Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, sworn in last week as the first Native American to oversee the nations public lands and waters, will kick off Thursdays forum,which will include representatives of industry, labor, conservationist groups, Indigenous people and others. Haaland, a former two-term New Mexico congresswoman, said she wants to strike the right balance as Interior manages energy development while seeking to conserve public lands and address climate change. An interim report to be completed this summer will outline recommendations for Interior and Congress to overhaul the fossil fuels program. A similar review of government coal sales during the Obama administration was to last three years, but was canceled by Trump. ___ Daly reported from Washington, D.C. ___",https://chinapost.nownews.com/20210324-2278487

The North Sea Transition Deal is the Governments blueprint for ushering the oil and gas sector towards net zero emissions while minimising job losses. Under the plan the North Sea fossil fuel sector will be encouraged to embrace new technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture to cut emissions, backed by 16bn in joint taxpayer and industry funding. There will also be more support to help workers move into other sectors such as offshore wind.

New extraction projects could still go ahead. Ministers have promised to implement a Climate Compatibility Checkpoint, that will judge whether any new licences issued for oil and gas extraction are compatible with the UKs goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. If the evidence suggests that a future licensing round would undermine the UKs climate goals or delivery of Net Zero, it will not go ahead, the Government promised. Ministers stressed the strategy would protect jobs while supporting the industrys transition to a low carbon future. We will not leave oil and gas workers behind in the United Kingdoms irreversible shift away from fossil fuels, said Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. But climate campaigners insist no new oil and gas licences are compatible with a net zero pathway. They warn the Government has missed a chance to demonstrate global leadership on the end of fossil fuel use.

Existing reserves being exploited globally will take us past the 2C target, let alone the target to limit global heating to 1.5C, said Ed Matthew from climate think tank E3G. The Government has lost the opportunity to become the first major oil and gas producer to end new exploration licenses, he added. This will undermine global efforts to persuade other countries to leave fossil fuels in the ground, which is essential if we are to end the climate crisis. Greenpeace said ministers failure to rule out issuing any new extraction licences was a colossal failure of climate leadership. Mel Evans, head of Greenpeace UKs oil campaign said: Instead of finding ways to prop up this volatile and polluting sector, a better proposition for workers and communities would be for the Government to confirm a ban on new licences, and put all its energies into a nationwide programme of retraining, reskilling and investment in renewables and green infrastructure.

218,Mines  Norway plans to dig metals from the seabed after oil and gas  the challenge is to protect the marine environment while  Pledge Times,pledgetimes,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 00:00:00,"Norwegian territorial waters contain important minerals and metals on the seabed. Underwater mining technology is also being studied in Finland.In Norwegian territorial waters contain important minerals and metals on the seabed. Underwater mining technology is also being studied in Finland. In recent years attempts were made to launch mines on the seabed in Papua New Guinean waters, on the other side of the globe. However, no progress has been made on commercial activities. Mines are now being planned on the seabed in Norway, where several important minerals and metals are waiting. Why do Norwegians believe in mines in extremely difficult conditions, even on the high seas? We have experience in the offshore industry that can be utilized in ecologically sustainable mining to produce the minerals and metals needed for the green transition, a professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Steinar Ellefmo tells Helsingin Sanomat. There is a lot of talk in Norway about a green revolution or transition, which means replacing fossil fuels with renewable electricity. Then a lot of battery materials, among other things, are needed. And most importantly, Norway also has potential wealth in its territorial waters. Offshore mines can significantly replace oil and gas production. Ellefmon a group at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) is studying sea ores in Trondheim. The seabed could be one of the new sources. Europe is a major consumer of minerals and metals. Europe should bear some of the cost by allowing mining in our backyard.  In this connection, Steinar Ellefmo also mentions Finland. Last year, Oslo-based research firm Rystad Energy published a summary of mining opportunities in Norwegian waters. The massive sulfide layers contain copper, cobalt, zinc, iron, gold, silver, and lead. There are sulfide layers especially on the backbone of the Mid-Atlantic, between the island of Jan Mayen and the Svalbard. The area is part of Norways exclusive economic zone, within which the country has the exclusive right to exploit ore and energy resources. Manganese modules or iron manganese concretions contain iron, manganese, nickel, cobalt and copper. Manganese, iron, copper, nickel, titanium, tellurium and rare earth metals have accumulated in the shell layers of the sea mountains. Rystad Energy has also assessed demand in the green revolution industry. Copper goes into batteries, wind farms, solar power plants and the electricity grid. Cobalt is needed in batteries and zinc in wind farms. Rare earth metals are needed in wind turbines and batteries. Silver goes to the solar panels. According to the largest demand and production modeling, Norway could sell $ 20 billion worth of offshore products in 2050. The figure can be compared to current oil and gas exports, which are worth about $ 60 billion annually. Offshore mines can significantly replace oil and gas production. Maritime oil and gas production technology can be adapted to seabed mines as well. Production vessels, or mobile drilling rigs, are now used to pump oil. A similar vessel can lift a pipe along the ore sludge. In the ship, the ore is separated from the sludge and the water is pumped down to the return pipe. There are also new companies in the field in Asia. Last year, the Chinese group CMI received preliminary approval from the U.S. Maritime Administration for an underwater excavator. The technology was tested last September in the South China Sea at a depth of 1,300 meters. One of the special features of the solution was that the excavator worked in conjunction with a manned submarine. According to the company, the equipment can be used to dig cobalt from the slopes of submarine mountains. The robot recognizes the ore, which it crushes with suitable tools into a sludge. Mines Of course, it can also be in shallow waters and water-filled mines, where the necessary technology has also been developed in Finland. The Unexmin diving robot has been developed at the University of Tampere to study water-filled mines. The results are commercialized by the Hungarian Unexmin Georobotics. There are 30,000 abandoned mines in Europe alone. Some of them should be re-excavated with underwater technology. Unxemin robots are designed for a maximum depth of 500 meters, so in principle up to that depth it is also able to explore submarine ore resources, says the professor of automation and mechanical engineering. Kari T. Koskinen From the University of Tampere. The ore prospecting robot is only the first stage tool. In our new Robominers project, we are developing an autonomous bio-based robot for mining and quarrying itself, which also includes technologies for underwater operations, says Koskinen. The project involves 14 organizations from 11 European countries. The goal is to develop a modular robot whose parts can be fed through a small hole into the mine. The parts then assemble themselves into a robot. The robot recognizes the ore, which it crushes with suitable tools into a sludge. The sludge is pumped up. The project envisions a semi-automatic, remote-controlled pilot robot by 2030 and automated digging underwater by 2050. With a little imagination, it is easy to imagine that if the device works in a narrow mine shaft, it will work in open water as well. We have the know-how and ability to make similar devices for the marine environment as well, says Koskinen. Because marine mines are only in the plans, it is possible to design them as ecological as well. Industry assures that environmental damage is prevented in advance. There are ecological problems we are working to solve, Ellefmo says. According to a Rystad Energy report, disruption to the ecosystem can be minimized by concentrating excavation on passive, inanimate or sparsely populated areas. Biologists warn that ecological disturbances can have a long-term effect. Max Planck Institute biologist Antje Boetius and his colleagues in Bremen have studied the long-term effects of offshore mining in the Mining impact project. In 1989, environmentalists plowed spotty recesses into the Pacific Ocean at the bottom of the Peruvian basin. The furrows give clues to the changes caused by the ore collection. Researchers have found that the microbial population recovers slowly. Still about 25 years later, the number of microbes in the fjord was only 70 percent of the intact seabed microbial population. The researchers calculated that it will take 50 years for the seabed to recover from nature. Only about ten percent of the seabed has been mapped. So the assessment of production potential rather than the environmental impact is still hampered by the limited knowledge of seabed ore resources and ecosystems. Only about ten percent of the seabed has been mapped. Only about three percent or a little more has been seen or studied visually, recalls the professor of geochemistry Christoph Beier From the University of Helsinki. This, of course, raises fears that we will actually destroy large, completely unexplored ecosystems before they are scientifically studied and evaluated. Many deep-sea species have not been studied very we",https://pledgetimes.com/mines-norway-plans-to-dig-metals-from-the-seabed-after-oil-and-gas-the-challenge-is-to-protect-the-marine-environment-while/

(AP)  President Joe Biden shut down oil and gas lease sales from the nations vast public lands and waters in his first days in office, citing worries about climate change. Now his administration has to figure out what do with the multibillion-dollar program without crushing a significant sector of the U.S. economy  and while fending off sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and the oil industry. The leasing ban is only temporary, although officials have declined to say how long it will last. And its unclear how much legal authority the government has to stop drilling on about 23 million acres (9 million hectares) previously leased to energy companies. Here are some questions hanging over Bidens Interior Department as it launches a months-long review of the governments petroleum sales with a virtual forum Thursday. WHY IS BIDEN TARGETTING OIL AND GAS LEASE SALES? Burning of oil, gas and coal from government-owned lands and waters is a top source of U.S. emissions, accounting for 24% of the nations greenhouse gases. Oil and gas account for the biggest chunk of human-caused fossil fuel emissions from federal lands following a drilling surge under former President Donald Trump. Emission reductions from a permanent leasing ban would be relatively small  about 100 million tons (91 million metric tons) annually, or less than 1% of global fossil fuel emissions, according to a study by a nonprofit research group. But environmentalists and others who want more aggressive action against climate change say a ban would nudge the economy in a new direction. Biden wants to substitute fossil fuel production and consumption with policies that promote renewable energy on public lands, such as wind and solar power. The federal government is a huge player here. The government has market power, said attorney Max Sarinsky with New York University Law Schools Institute for Policy Integrity. If you restrict the supply (of oil and gas), you alter the market and you create a better environment for more sustainable fuels. Lease sales and royalties companies pay on extracted oil and gas brought in more than $83 billion in revenue over the past decade. Half the money from onshore drilling goes to the state where it occurred. Money from offshore drilling gets shared with states at a lesser rate and pays for a conservation fund used to preserve land nationwide. WHATS BEEN DONE SO FAR? The administration postponed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and Utah. Biden earlier had suspended leasing in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Interior officials say the fossil fuel program has failed to consider climate impacts and that irresponsible leasing practices carve up wildlife habitat, threaten Native American cultural and sacred sites and lock up public lands that could be used for recreation or conservation. After what they call a fire sale of public energy reserves under Trump, Bidens team argues that companies still have plenty of undeveloped leases  almost 14 million acres (6 million hectares) in western states and more than 9 million acres (3.6 million hectares) offshore. Companies also have about 7,700 unused drilling permits  enough for years. Despite the moratorium, the Biden administration has continued to issue new permits for existing leases, including more than 200 in March, records show. Environmentalists want that to stop, but an outright drilling ban would raise thorny legal issues. Companies could claim they have the right to extract oil and gas after spending years and millions of dollars to secure leases. WHAT ARE BIDENS OPTIONS? A ban on new leases means drilling would fade out as existing ones expire. It would be a heavy blow for western and Gulf Coast states that heavily depend on oil and gas revenue to pay for schools, roads and other services. Another option is to increase royalty fees to reflect the social cost of climate change  damage from rising seas, drought, wildfires and other global warming impacts. That would keep revenue flowing and make it more expensive to drill on federal land, forcing companies to concentrate on the most profitable reserves and reducing emissions, though by less than a ban. If its not possible to have a carbon tax on all oil and gas extraction, at least we could do something akin to that on public lands, said James Stock, a Harvard University economist and former member of the White House Council on Economic Advisers under Obama. HOW MANY JOBS COULD BE LOST? Economists say claims by industry groups and allies in Congress that a leasing ban would trigger massive job losses are greatly exaggerated. An industry-promoted University of Wyoming study projected almost 300,000 jobs lost by 2025. But historical data on energy jobs suggest a much smaller impact of about 60,000 jobs, said Jeremy Weber, former chief energy economist for Trumps White House Council of Economic Advisers and now a University of Pittsburgh associate professor Thats still a significant number as the U.S. economy recovers from job losses in the pandemic. And even limited job losses could profoundly affect local economies in Wyoming, New Mexico and other oil-dependent states. Theres also no guarantee such impacts would be offset by Bidens promise to deliver millions of new green energy jobs, such as installing solar panels or helping with environmental cleanups of abandoned oil wells and coal mines. Despite promises by renewable energy advocates, such jobs dont fill the bucket like oil and gas does, said Jim Willox, a commissioner in Converse County, Wyoming, the states top crude producer and home to several new wind farms. Aware of such concerns, Biden climate adviser Gina McCarthy met with executives from Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other companies Monday to discuss ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A White House statement said the administration is not fighting the oil and gas sector and wants to create jobs while addressing emissions. American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said independent forecasts show natural gas and oil will provide about half of the global energy mix for decades to come. WHATS NEXT?

223,Oil and Gas Pipeline MLP's Outlook Promising Despite Coronavirus,zacks,"Mar 23, 2021",2021-03-23 13:59:25,"The midstream business model is not significantly exposed to the coronavirus-induced commodity price fluctuations since most infrastructure is being contracted for long term. Read More Hide Full Article The Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLPindustry comprises master limited partnerships (or MLPs) which are primarily engaged in transporting oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids (NGL) to consumers in North America. The services provided by the partnerships entail the gathering and processing of commodities as well. It is to be noted that MLPs are different from companies as interests in MLPs are considered units (not shares) and unitholders are partners in the business. Here are the industrys three major themes: The partnerships generate stable fee-based revenues from diversified networks of midstream infrastructure that is being utilized by shippers and customers under long-term contracts. Moreover, the partnerships have key capital projects under construction that will generate additional fee-based revenues. Importantly, the midstream business model is not significantly exposed to the coronavirus-induced commodity price fluctuations since most of the infrastructure is being used by shippers for long term. With oil prices recovering gradually  West Texas Intermediate crude has recovered almost 8% in the past month  most analysts opine that the decline in the tally of weekly rig will narrow down further. In fact, some analysts believe that if the recovery sustains, since more people are getting back to work on easing lockdown measures, many explorers will consider adding rigs. This signifies the possibility of more oil production, thereby increasing demand for midstream assets. Demand for NGL is on the rise since the commodity is being used for producing advanced materials that are being employed for the manufacturing of lighter aeroplanes and cars. Since the partnerships connect NGL consumers and producers through midstream energy assets, the unitholders can expect significant cashflows from higher fee-based revenues. Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Prospects The Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLP industry is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energysector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #28, which places it in the top 11% of more than 250 Zacks industries. The groups Zacks Industry Rank which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Taking into consideration the increasingly bullish outlook of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But its worth taking a look at the industrys recent stock-market performance and valuation picture first. Industry Lags Sector & S&P 500 The Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLP industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has declined 46.4% in the past year against the S&P 500s rise of 4.6% and the broader sectors fall of 40.4%. One-Year Price Performance Industrys Current Valuation Since midstream-focused oil and gas partnerships use fixed rate debt for majority of their borrowings, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, the industry is currently trading at 7.7X compared with the S&P 500s 11.63X. It is, however, significantly above the sectors trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 4.01X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 16.98X, as low as 6.70X, with a median of 13.36X. Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio Bottom Line Although the partnerships rely on significant debt capital to maintain existing midstream infrastructures and finance growth projects, more than 90% of their debt portfolio carries a fixed interest rate, which reduces threats stemming from interest rate volatility. Also, the partnerships midstream business is less exposed to fluctuations in oil and gas prices, reflecting a stable business model.

Oil & Gas Gas price for ONGC to inch up to $1.82, fall below $4 for Reliance-BP Simultaneously, the price for gas produced from difficult fields such as deepsea, which is based on a different formula, is likely to fall below USD 4 per mmBtu from the current price of USD 4.06 PTI March 23, 2021, 15:31 IST New Delhi: Government-dictated price for natural gas produced by companies such as ONGC is likely to inch up marginally to USD 1.82 next week while the same for difficult fieldslike one operated by Reliance-BP may fall below USD 4, sources said. The price of gas, which is used to generate electricity, make fertiliser and convert into CNG for automobiles and cooking gas for households, is due to bi-annual revision next week. The rates paid for gas produced from fields given to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation(ONGC) and Oil India Ltd(OIL) are most likely to go up to USD 1.82 per million British thermal unit for six month period beginning April 1 from a decade low of USD 1.79 currently, two people aware of the matter said. Simultaneously, the price for gas produced from difficult fields such as deepsea, which is based on a different formula, is likely to fall below USD 4 per mmBtu from the current price of USD 4.06. This is the maximum price that Reliance Industries Ltdand its partner BP plc are entitled to for gas they produced from deepsea blocks they won under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP). While the government sets the price of gas produced by ONGC from fields given to it on a nomination basis, it bi-annually announces a cap or maximum price that operators who won exploration acreage under NELP can get. The operators are supposed to do a market price discovery by seeking bids from users but that rate is subject to the price ceiling announced by the government, they said. Reliance-BP had in recent price discovery for new gas from their Krishna Godavari basin block, got rates of over USD 6 per mmBtu but they would get less than USD 4 as per the pricing formula. Natural gas price is set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 -- each year based on rates prevalent in surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia. At the last revision, the price was cut by 25 per cent to USD 1.79 per mmBtu for six months beginning October 1 from USD 2.39. This is the third straight reduction in rate in one year. The price was cut by a steep 26 per cent to USD 2.39 in April last year. The rate paid to producers of new gas from difficult fields such as deepsea was cut to USD 4.06 per mmBtu from USD 5.61. The rate from October 1 is equivalent to the price paid to ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) prior to May 2020 when formula-based pricing was first introduced. ONGC, sources said, had posted Rs 4,272 crore loss on gas business in 2017-18, which is likely to widen to over Rs 6,000 crore in the current fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021), they said. ONGC has seen incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic meters per day of gas it produces from domestic fields shortly after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula that had ""inherent limitations"" as it was based on pricing hubs of gas surplus countries such as the US, Canada, and Russia. Sources said ONGC in a recent communique to the government has stated that the break-even price to produce gas from new discoveries was in the range of USD 5-9 per mmBtu. In May 2010, the government had raised the rate of gas sold to power and fertiliser firms from USD 1.79 per mmBtu to USD 4.20. ONGC and OIL got USD 3.818 per mmBtu price for the gas they produced from fields given to them on a nomination basis and after adding a 10 per cent royalty, the fuel cost USD 4.20 per mmBtu for consumers. The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula. The new formula takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (the UK), Alberta (Canada), and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months - on April 1 and October 1 each year. The rate at the first revision, using the new formula, came to USD 5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till it touched USD 2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period. Subsequently, it rose to USD 3.69 in April 2019-September 2019 before being cut by 12.5 per cent in October 2019 to USD 3.23.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 23  Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) remains optimistic of strong potential in oil and gas and is making every effort to create conducive investment conditions. President and group chief executive officer Tengku Muhammad Taufik Tengku Aziz said the national oil company currently has 13 blocks on offer in the recently launched Malaysia Bid Round 2021. He said the bid round incorporated innovative block offerings, flexible bidding options, a two-phased exploration period, as well as data access and transparency. With more than 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent yet to be discovered, Malaysia presents a sizable runway of potential reserves, he said in his keynote address at the 13th International Petroleum Technology Conference (IPTC) held virtually today. Tengku Muhammad Taufik said Petronas has announced its aspiration to achieve net zero carbon emission by 2050 last year, an aspiration that it strongly believed would keep the group on track to be a progressive energy and solutions partner enriching lives for a sustainable future. He said the national oil company is moving forward in its recovery pathways by making technology its differentiator, digitalisation its accelerator and data as its assets, and these elements would play an important role in providing the crucial insights to develop more streamlined, prudent and efficient operations. To contend with growing energy demand, Tengku Muhammad Taufik said Petronas must now develop and deliver various forms of energy and technologies. Renewable energy alone will not be able to meet growing energy demand amidst growing populations and economic expansion, which we expect to see post-recovery, particularly in Asia. There is the problem of intermittency that needs to be resolved with advances in battery technology, he added.

A lot of eyeballs in North Dakota will be watching these hearings, including North Dakotas top oil and gas regulator Lynn Helms. In the states most recent monthly oil production report, Helms indicated he will watch the proceedings but doesnt expect to offer comments during the forum itself. Thats due more to timing than anything else. The March meeting of the North Dakota Industrial Commission isnt until five days later. I havent been cleared by the policy people to comment at the public forum, Helms said. But I am going to recommend to the Industrial Commission members that we offer them after that. So after the public comment period opens, I really anticipate we will be commenting. Helms indicated Division of Oil and Gas personnel have already begun evaluating which lands could be affected and in what way by the Biden administrations impending analysis. I think we are really going to focus on what we call split estates in North Dakota, Helms said. Most of the federal public lands in North Dakota are split estates, where a tract as small as 10 acres of federal lands can prevent the drilling or development of 5 to 600 acres of private or state land by just blocking the ability to lease and permit on those lands. Among such tracts is one by Trenton, which has 10 acres of federal minerals, and 580 acres north and south of that belonging to five individuals. The properties were to have been nominated for lease during the March sale, and would have supported between three and 45 wells. But now the whole thing is on hold. They are actually subjecting themselves to private litigation by blocking the leasing of those small tracts and preventing the drilling of those state and private minerals, Helms said. So we have a unique and interesting story to tell, along with the cumulative effects (on the states oil and gas production.) Financially the cumulative effects are potentially significant, Helms said, though perhaps not as sweeping as had initially been thought. Its less than expected because it was retracted from tribal and allotted lands, anything held in trust, Helms said. That is, dominantly, the best geography in North Dakota. So that really mitigated the impact on the state. Helms said his preliminary analysis suggests it could affect 150 new wells in the upcoming biennium, and would accelerate from there if the suspension becomes a long-term thing. Right now, theres a significant slowdown, in that no one in the district or local offices can issue permits, Helms said. They all have to go to Washington D.C. But its still possible to get one. So its not as impactful as the initial letter would have implied, since it doesnt apply to trust lands and there isnt an absolute moratorium on permitting. Its just a slowdown. Hearing details The Department of the Interiors public hearing on the federal oil and gas program was ordered by President Joe Biden in January. The forum will be from 1 to 4:30 p.m. March 25 in a live Zoom Webinar.

In light of the rising oil prices since November last year, debt investors have grown more interested in high-yield energy bonds, after having steered clear of the sector for most of the past two years.  As a result, the riskier lower-rated U.S. oil firms have managed to raise a total of over U$20 billion this year alone, a record amount in data going back to 1996, according to Refinitiv estimates cited by the FT.  For example, Chesapeake Energy  the poster child of U.S. shale firms drilling themselves to oblivion, which filed for bankruptcy last year and emerged from Chapter 11 in January this year  issued in February US$1 billion in senior notes, with part of the proceeds expected to fund the companys emergence from Chapter 11.  Many other companies have managed to price bond issues this year, as debt investors have started to look more positively at the short-term prospects for oil firms.  In the longer term, however, the keyword is caution, and investors advise caution because of the possible negative effects of the energy transition on the oil industry.  Earlier this year, S&P Global Ratings warned it could downgrade the ratings on some of the worlds biggest oil firms, citing increased risks coming from the energy transition, price volatility, and weaker profitability. The credit rating agency revised its industry risk assessment to moderately high risk from intermediate risk, due to the challenges the energy transition poses to companies, the pressure on the firms return on capital, and the volatility in oil and gas prices.

229,E&P Plus World View: What Prize Remains for Oil and Gas in the UKCS?,hartenergy,"Mar 22, 2021",2021-03-22 14:00:00,"Though the reputational and financial gains to be made from the renewables sector are now more attractive and attainable for investors, oil and gas retains a crucial role in the energy mix going forward. here . Despite turbulent pricing for oil and gas and a strong social pivot toward the energy transition and decarbonization, determination and cautious optimism prevails to make a success of the remaining life in the U.K. Continental Shelf (UKCS). In its 2019 economic report, Oil & Gas UK (OGUK) asserted that North Sea firms were on track to produce roughly the same amount of oil and gas in 2020 as they did the previous year, regardless of the unforeseen challenges thrown up by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with more than GBP35 billion of investment opportunities over the next 10 years included in companies plans at the outset of 2020, the annual study concedes there is real uncertainty about the viability of many of these initiatives going forward. Worley is a global provider of project and asset support services in the energy, chemicals and resources sectors. (Source: Worley) As a mature basin, dealing with aging infrastructure and challenging recovery costs, those in the local market are competing with easy and more profitable projects in other locations. However, it continues to be viewed as a resilient role model for burgeoning regions to concurrently reduce lifting costs and improve production in deeper, harsher and more demanding environments. Conversely, its fortune and fate also can act as a portent to oil and gas hubs reaching the dusk of life but where the sun still shines brightly. Making hay According to research by McKinsey & Co., aggregate fossil fuel demand is set to peak in 2027 with oil peaking in 2029 and gas in 2037, partially due to the impacts of COVID-19. The study surmises that while hydrocarbon consumption will plateau, more than half of all global energy demand will continue to be met by oil and gas up to 2050. There seems no doubt that standing still is not the answer. A different approach will be required to secure and sustain success in this new era for the energy mix. In less than a decade, the playing field of the North Sea has undergone dramatic change with many of the supermajors departing and making way for a new generation of smaller, more nimble, independent operators. There has also been a significant shift in the size and type of field development being progressed to extend life in the basin. This renovation looks likely to continue for another decade as renewables, such as offshore wind, hydrogen and greater electrification, take time to upscale. (Source: Worley) As one of the most mature provinces for oil and gas, the UKCS has continually evolved technologies to satisfy its specific requirementsmany times ahead of other regionswhich affords great opportunity. However, the counter point is now a very cost-focused culture where commoditization of the supply chain has ramped up, potentially hindering further investment in technology. Though the reputational and financial gains to be made from the renewables sector are now more attractive and attainable for investors, oil and gas retains a crucial role in the energy mix going forward. As the transition starts to pick up pace, oil and gas production is still considered the cash cow for investors. From a supply chain perspective, the ideal investment is one in which the technology being used to drive down the costs of remaining reserves can also build in efficiencies to lower carbon footprint and increase sustainability. Likewise, key to any kind of business, regardless of size or market, is learning to adapt to the conditions, adopt digital technologies and be agile in that change. Diversification into renewables also becomes increasingly important to spread the risk and increase the gains. Opportunity knocks It need not be doom and gloom for the sector. In fact, the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry makes it inherently more flexible to ride through the lows and take the prize with the highs. Its a myth to think of monolith organizations as dinosaurs seeking fossils. Adaptability whilst maintaining productivity has always been a necessary trait. Commercial prospects do exist in this sector, particularly as the U.K. boasts a fast-moving net-zero agenda and a highly qualified and highly skilled workforce with easily transferrable talent ready to expedite it. For example, knowledge and experience gleaned from decades working with natural gas enhance the safe and sustainable adoption and implementation of hydrogen management, processing and transportation. A strong skills base in the North Sea today is vital or our future role will be limited. As traditional oil and gas companies such as bp, Shell and Equinor evolve into international energy companies, the supply chain is pivoting toward those with strong provenance already in place. The issue is one of 10 keynote program sessions at SPE Offshore Europe 2021 being held Sept. 7-10 in Aberdeen, Scotland. It will bring together the regulator and a selection of operators at different stages of evolution to share experience and insight and discuss what is needed to survive and thrive in this period of extraordinary change and pressure. The sessions, which include transitioning to lower carbon solutions, oil and gas security of supply, lowering carbon footprint and emissions, and future collaboration models, are aligned to the overall theme and direction of the event: Oil & Gas: Working Together for a Net Zero Future. Aker Solutions engineers the products, systems and services required to unlock energy. (Source: Aker Solutions) Recipe for success in E&P With the continuing need for the provision of oil and gas to satisfy energy demand, alongside new and broader sources of energy provision, there is a market for many types of energy providers. Like an elaborate quilt, the industry is a patchwork of diverse companies each approaching the marketplace on a range of routes. Some of the larger internationals are using technology to drive it while smaller businesses are using varying work processes and practices. The winners will be those that can balance and take into consideration the agenda for decarbonization as well as continuing safe and sustainable production. For the future of E&P, which will be a major talking point at SPE Offshore Europe 2021, companies that can approach the marketplace with the right cost base and approach for managing and developing commercial deals and models, which may not be so heavily burdened with their own resources to keep costs lean, will make money. Essentially, if the recovery continues and lifting costs can be kept at or below $20/bbl, then theres still a profit to be made, even between US$40 to US$50/bbl. Anything is possible with the right combination of field, development plans and financial acumen. This also affords the industry opportunities to work together and develop solutions to reduce flaring and venting, for example, and legitimize their social license to operate. United we stand and deliver For the U.K., there has been a huge jump forward in terms of government investment in the low carbon agenda.

231,Rystad Energy: Spending gap narrows between renewables and oil and gas,energyglobal,"Mar 22, 2021",2021-03-22 11:00:00,"Rystad Energy analysis states that renewables spending is projected to meet a new record in 2021. Monday, 22 March 2021 11:00 Advertisement Capital expenditure for renewable energy projects is set for a new record in 2021, a Rystad Energy analysis shows, forecast to reach US$243 billion, and narrowing the gap with oil and gas spending, which is projected to be relatively flat this year at US$311 billion. While oilfield service suppliers have taken considerable steps to make structural changes and diversify, 2020s financial results suggest more needs to be done. Renewables capex, which equals purchases from supply firms, is set for another record year, picking up where last year left off, when spending hit US$224 billion. By contrast, oil and gas capex this year is expected to stay in line with 2020s US$306 billion  a far cry from the industrys better days, as just in 2019 E&Ps splurged US$422 billion on supply purchases, Rystad Energy states. The spending gap between renewable energy and oil and gas is closing, as capex for renewables is now just 22% below the estimate for upstream projects. Most of the renewable energy spending will go towards onshore wind projects, rising to US$100 billion from US$94 billion in 2020. Solar photovoltaics (PV) spending is expected to climb to US$96 billion this year from US$88 billion last year, while offshore wind will see capex grow to US$46 billion from US$43 billion, according to Rystad Energy. Most of the expenditure stems from Asia, which has 156 GW of capacity under construction as of January 2021, followed by Europe with 32 GW. Chinas decision to slowly reduce subsidy assistance from January forced many projects to start construction early, which further supported spending activity. Much of the spending is down to Chinas 800-MW Rudong offshore wind farm and the 2 GW Zhuozi County Project, as well as Orsteds 1.4 GW Hornsea 2 project off the UK. Rystad Energy states that upstream capex is expected to increase by less than 2% in 2021, with spending on greenfield projects declining by 6%. However, sanctioning activity is estimated to increase this year by 30%, mainly due to Qatargas US$30 billion North Field East development, which makes up 33% of the total budget to be sanctioned this year. Last years events forced leading oil and gas businesses to look at strategies to reduce exposure to the risky market amid the energy transition. Oilfield service suppliers, for instance, have started a considerable transformation, hoping to be more relevant in a greener market and become a more attractive option for investors, says Chinmayi Teggi, Energy Service Analyst at Rystad Energy. After a lamentable 2020, the financial results of some companies suggest more needs to be done. Rystad Energy has compared the revenues of 170 listed suppliers exposed to the upstream oil and gas, wind, and solar markets. Its analysis reveals that while oil and gas-focused businesses on average saw revenue drop 23% in 2020 from the previous year, wind and solar PV-focused businesses enjoyed an 18% growth in sales. Quarterly revenue for service companies exposed to the upstream sector has seen a massive deterioration, with 4Q revenue last year slumping 25% from a year earlier amid a lack of new contracts and slow execution of backlog work. Revenue from well services and seismic segments fell last year by 35% from 2019 levels, while drilling tools revenue shrank 25%, according to Rystad Energy. However, some positive performance was seen from giants Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Halliburton, driven by a combination of backlog execution improvements and an uptick in US shale activity towards the end of the year. The overall revenue of these companies gained 6% in 4Q from the preceding three months. By contrast, service companies exposed to the wind and solar sectors saw growth in 4Q of last year compared to 2019. Service players exposed to wind projects recorded a 15% y/y boost to revenues for the 4Q2020, with full-year revenues improving by 20%. Sales at service providers exposed to solar projects rose 3% in 4Q from the year-earlier period and climbed 14% for the full year, Rystad Energy states. Almost 65% of the wind equipment revenues analysed  which includes 18 listed companies  is down to the top three suppliers Vestas Wind Systems, General Electric (GE) and Siemens Energy. The companies explored multiple opportunities to increase profitability and reported order intake growth, indicating a fruitful future. Chinese service suppliers, including LONGi Green Energy, Jinko Solar, and Trina Solar  companies that also manufacture solar panels  accounted for most of the growth. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent decline in demand last year for PV systems led to a slowdown in sales in the 2H2020. Reduced demand, coupled with the price increase of raw materials, brought notable changes to the solar PV industry, including a shift to high-margin orders and efficiency improvements for modules  all in a bid to increase margins. Meanwhile, companies exposed to both oil and gas and renewable energy were able to offset deteriorating conventional revenues with better-performing wind and solar PV-focused segments.

Germany plans to extend a lockdown to contain COVID-19 infections into a fifth month, according to a draft proposal, after new cases exceeded levels authorities say will cause hospitals to be overstretched. ""The reality is that we're still a long way from a full demand recovery, and it's the record levels of withdrawn production capacity that's the main prop for the oil market"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at Axi. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have put in place unprecedented production cuts in a pact to balance global markets after demand plunged during the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. drillers are starting to take advantage of an earlier spike in prices on optimism about returning demand, adding the most rigs for extracting oil since January in the week through Friday. The oil and gas drilling rig tally, an early indicator of future production, rose nine to 411 last week, the highest since April, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely followed report on Friday. The rig count has been rising over the past seven months and is up nearly 70 per cent from a record low of 244 in August.

235,Egypt And Schlumberger Look To Digitalize Oil Production,oilprice,"Mar 21, 2021",2021-03-21 15:00:00,"Egypt and Schlumberger are teaming up in a first-of-its-kind tech trial that will leverage data to optimize oil and gas exploration The digitalization of subsurface information to collect data and improve production techniques could enhance exploration and drilling processes worldwide, led by Egypt.  A new project from The Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and US-based oilfield services company Schlumberger, the Egypt Upstream Gateway EUG, will digitalize subsurface information and make the data available worldwide through this access point. It aims to provide geological data to enhance drilling and production in the countrys waters.  Taking just one year to build, the EUG is expected to collect over 100 years' worth of accumulated national onshore and offshore seismic, non-seismic, well-log, production, and additional subsurface data under a single platform, according to a Schlumberger press release.  The first-of-its-kind technology in Egypt will use these data to alleviate risk in the exploration of oil across multiple basins. Egypt hopes to lead the way through the digitalization of data to enhance access to information and encourage greater foreign investment in the sector.  The Egypt Upstream Gateway will digitally promote Egypts oil and gas bid rounds through seamless online access to the sectors data, as well as endorsing our exploration potential worldwide. Tarek El-Molla, Egypts minister of petroleum and mineral resources, explained.  We believe that EUG will create game-changing impacts by promoting Egypts E&P potential on a truly global scale, Khaled Al Mogharbel, EVP of Geographies at Schlumberger, added about the development.  Related India Throws The Oil Tanker Industry A Lifeline  The heads of ten energy companies, including Italian Eni, American Apache, and German Wintershall Dea, signed membership agreements in the portal following its launch in February.  Over the last year, there has been a significant push towards been greater digitalisation across the oil and gas sector by both the private and public entities around the world. Oil and gas companies are now working hand-in-hand with tech firms, from giants to start-ups, who provide innovative cost and time saving solutions for energy exploration, monitoring, extraction, and delivery.  In 2020, of all oil and gas companies surveyed for DNV-GLs industry outlook report, 92 percent expected to increase or maintain levels of spending on digitalization. The main reason cited was adding value to the industry.  Previous developments in digitalization have already been made at the international level. In 2018, the Open Subsurface Data Universe OSDU forum was created as a means of establishing a standardised data platform where members could work in collaboration to ensure secure, reliable, worldwide access to subsurface and well information.  Over 35 oil and gas companies are currently participating in the OSDU, including founding companies Equinor and Shell. Members are contributing their knowledge and expertise to enhance the system, to develop the quantity and quality of shared subsurface data across the sector.  Emerson joined in 2020 with the aim of improving the efficiency of reservoir modelers and reservoir engineers and accelerate digital innovation across reservoir workflows. The standardisation of data through the system will help companies save time and money through a more streamlined and accurate information sharing process.  We will soon see what Egypts new EUG adds to the development of subsurface data as bidding begins on the exploration of oil across 24 regions in the Gulf of Suez, the Western Sahara, and the eastern and western Mediterranean.

""Building a brand new pipeline across Canada would be as big a challenge as keeping this existing pipeline operating  in fact, it might actually even be a bigger challenge to get unanimity from Canadians to do that,"" he said. ""We've seen multiple occasions where we can't as a country get behind  building a pipeline. So it's important to keep the existing ones up and running."" Line 5 isn't the only cross-border hotspot. In Minnesota, more than 200 people have been arrested in recent months as Indigenous protests escalate against Enbridge's $10-billion upgrade of an existing stretch of the network, this one known as Line 3. Protesters have been sitting in trees, shackling themselves to equipment and taking up residence inside sections of pipe, organizers say. Then there's Dakota Access, a 1,900-kilometre line between North Dakota and Illinois that faces a reckoning April 9. That is the court-ordered deadline for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to decide whether to shut down the pipeline and await a thorough environmental review. The DAPL case is widely seen as a likely bellwether for the pipeline industry in the U.S., where both Vice-President Kamala Harris and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, America's first Indigenous cabinet member, support shutting it down. ""The quarrel is not with the pipeline companies, the quarrel is with the producers, and the product they produce,"" Tertzakian said  a ""ridiculous proposition"" based on the premise that ending oil production in Canada will somehow solve the climate change problem. Instead, the challenge going forward is to reframe the debate to focus on which companies should be the ones meeting the demand for fossil fuels, which experts say will persist for decades to come. ""Clearly, who should supply the oil are the companies that are walking the talk in the world and making a concerted effort to reduce  emissions,"" he said.

239,Energy industry met challenge of addressing pandemic,mrt,"Mar 21, 2021",2021-03-21 03:59:54,"For a century, oil and gas producers have been challenged by the complexities of coaxing... As the pandemic intensified last year, energy companies faced the challenge of keeping their workforce safe and healthy while also keeping an essential industry in operation amid the economic shutdown and oil market crash. TAMIR KALIFA/NYT For a century, oil and gas producers have been challenged by the complexities of coaxing oil and natural gas from Permian Basin rocks. But they have never faced a challenge like the one they encountered last March as the novel coronavirus began to tear through the nation. As the virus spread, businesses of all kinds sent employees home and shut down, forcing them to figure out how to continue operating in this new environment. Companies across the energy spectrum told the Reporter-Telegram that as the pandemic took hold, safety became a top consideration. Chevron reacted by announcing a capital reduction of nearly $2 billion the Permian in order to balance short-term cash flow with preserving long-term value, Catie Matthews, public and government affairs advisor, told the Reporter-Telegram by email. She said the company reduced its operated rig count from17 to four over three months. Production was curtailed in the second quarter but returned to levels seen in early 2020 during the second half of the year. Matthews said Chevron also rushed to support the communities where it operates by contributing over $700,000, including in-kind donations, to partners and programs across the Permian to support food security, education and frontline operations. A year later, she said, Every decision we make starts with the core belief that people always come first. The health and safety of our workforce, their families and communities where we do business are Chevrons primary concerns. We continue to take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure, including referring symptomatic workers for testing and screening workers and visitors at company facilities. Business continuity measures, including alternative work arrangements, are being implemented as needed. Our thoughts continue to be with those affected by COVID-19 and the healthcare workers on the front lines. Occidental Petroleum implemented a work-from-home policy for those employees able to work from home. For those performing essential duties at the companys worksite, best practices for safety and health were implemented, including social distancing, wearing face coverings and other personal protective equipment. Company officials and internal health and safety experts continue to monitor guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and local health officials where Occidental operates. Vicki Hollub, chief executive officer, commented during recent earnings calls that No matter how favorable or challenging the environment in which we operate, we never take our eye off safety. Many of our teams tied or set new safety records last year, while our company-wide performance was our best ever as we simultaneously work to minimize the risk from COVID. The capability of our outstanding employees to consistently deliver remarkable results safely was key to our ability to navigate the challenges of the last year as well as the challenges presented by the winter storm. She continued, While much has changed during this pandemic for our company and our industry, the quality of our asset base and the skills of our teams will support success in 2021 and beyond. Well continue to apply and build our knowledge and continuously improve our track record of operational excellence. Our teams worked diligently to advance our development technologies and technical operations to ensure we emerge from this challenge stronger than before. The innovation and ingenuity of our workforce, combined with our differentiated low-carbon strategy, will drive our success and sustainability long into the future. Coping with the pandemic could be more challenging for those unable to work from home, like drilling companies, service companies and midstream companies. Reflecting on how Patterson-UTI reacted, Diana Dotolo, senior vice president of human resources, told the Reporter-Telegram by email, In a word, collaboration. She went on to comment that, When things first started, our immediate priority was to establish a representative cross section of leaders across all aspects of our company to collaborate on putting together a COVID-19 risk mitigation plan. That plan was the driver for all other actions and activities. The team we pulled together included Legal, HR Marketing, Operations, IT, and Supply Chain (full company representation)  all the major functions and internal stakeholders. We assessed where we were against what we knew about the virus and its trajectory and then overlaid that information with what we needed to consider doing  in priority order overall, as well as to meet needs at individual locations. Given all the uncertainties for each state where we operate and changing dynamics with CDC guidance, we had to (and still do) revisit the plan periodically as the situation developed and changed. Because it was classified as an essential business, she said the company remained open and operational but had to develop guidelines and protocols for office workers versus on-site teams. That included allowing individuals the option of working remotely and providing computers if needed. Visitors to company facilities were limited and Patterson worked with leaning companies at its offices to establish protocols and standards and engaged with sanitizing companies to dispatch them were exposures occurred. What we discovered is how hard it is for managers to check in and manage teams remotely, so we had to develop protocols and trainings to ensure teams were running effectively, she said. The last year has probably been the most challenging year in my 30+ year career as an HR professional -- especially when considering we were managing a people health pandemic alongside a market health pandemic. However, it also came with some very gratifying moments watching people step up and work together to tackle the challenges that were in front of us. When I look back on the past year, I am stunned at all we accomplished. The major changes we made would have been challenging in a normal year, but the addition of the pandemic dimension, makes what we were able to do truly amazing. We leaned heavily on our team and as things kept changing rapidly, we were able to adjust and manage on the fly. What Patterson has learned from its experiences is that people can be very effective working remotely, she said, though many missed the personal interaction. Another lesson was the need to manage people differently remotely than onsite. Managers must be more intentional and individualized in their outreach, she said, which is critical when it comes to bringing new people onboard.

The irreconcilable differences are rooted in the regional nature of the energy industry in both countries, experts say, with climate-change hardliners on one side and oil-and-gas traditionalists on the other. The solution, when it does come, will likely be not from the courtroom, but the classrooms producing the energy sectors next corporate suite. Weve got a very smart cohort of next-generation oil and gas leaders, said Peter Tertzakian, an energy economist, author and adjunct business professor at the University of Calgary.This very smart and energetic cohort is also very frustrated, if not confused, because of all of the negative stigma around the business. As young people with a bred-in-the-bone generational concern about climate change, theyre also very motivated to find ways to confront that challenge from inside an industry long seen as its anathema. Theyre trying to figure out everything from how to effectively pivot their organizations into that new transitional world, and how to also change Those narratives are often deeply frustrating to people in places like Alberta and Texas, where the fossil-fuel industry has been part of daily life for most of the last 150 yearsBut because pipelines, by their very nature, deliver the spoils of the Alberta oilsands to and through parts of the continent that can see little to no clear benefit, conflict is inevitable.You had this vast set of interest groups that lay between the resource and the market, that were basically not getting anything out of the deal, said Andrew Leach, an energy economist who teaches at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.Theres no, like, shut-it-down-tomorrow view of the world in all but the fringes in Alberta, whereas outside of Alberta its really easy to say, Yeah, just dont do that. That seems to be whats happening in Michigan, where Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has suddenly revoked a 1953 agreement that allowed Enbridge Inc.s Line 5 pipeline between Wisconsin and Sarnia, Ont., to move oil and gas underneath the Straits of Mackinac, an ecologically delicate section of the Great Lakes. Whitmer, a close ally of Joe Biden who was on his list of potential running mates, announced the decision less than a week after he was declared the winner of last years presidential election. Two months later, Biden famously cancelled the Keystone XL pipeline expansion, which aimed to move more than 800,000 barrels a day of Alberta oilsands bitumen to refineries on the U.S. East Coast. Shutting down Line 5 after more than 65 years would trigger a devastating energy and economic crisis in both countries, Enbridge vice-president Vern Yu told a House of Commons committee last week. Existing domestic lines are already at or near their peak capacity, and given public attitudes towards pipelines in Canada, it would be impossible to develop an alternative line that avoids crossing the border, he added.Building a brand new pipeline across Canada would be as big a challenge as keeping this existing pipeline operating  in fact, it might actually even be a bigger challenge to get unanimity from Canadians to do that, he said.Weve seen multiple occasions where we cant as a country get behind building a pipeline.

Those are the companies that should be left standing  the best players on the team. Even deep in the heart of Texas  an oil-and-gas state laced by 770,000 kilometres of pipeline, nearly as much in all of Canada  energy educators are beginning to see evidence of a shift. Richard Denne, director of the TCU Energy Institute at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Tex., said what used to be a diehard Texas student body is increasingly from liberal-minded California. Were starting to pivot to include much more of the renewables, Denne said in an interview, noting that one of his geology classes, once focused primarily on petrochemicals, is evolving. Im going to pivot that to be less oil and gas, and more of the other  uranium and the rare earths required for renewables and hydro and geothermal and all that kind of stuff, so that they get more of a broad brush and not just oil and gas.

241,The Worlds Biggest Oil Company Is About To Release Its 2020 Results,oilprice,"Mar 20, 2021",2021-03-20 23:00:00,"Saudi Aramco will release its financial results for 2020 this Sunday, results that could dramatically impact both the oil market and the global geopolitical power balance The Worlds Biggest Oil Company Is About To Release Its 2020 Results By Cyril Widdershoven- Mar 20, 2021, 6:00 PM CDT Join Our Community Saudi Aramco, the worlds largest oil and gas company, will present its 2020 financial results on Sunday, March 21st. Considering the turbulence and volatility of 2020, Aramcos results may reveal some of the trends to watch over the next decade in the oil industry. The impact of COVID-19, immense demand destruction, high volatility in oil prices, and continued weak demand are all factors to keep in mind when assessing the upcoming Aramco figures. As a semi-listed national oil company, Aramco has the largest company-based oil reserves on earth, estimated to be around 276 billion barrels of crude. The financial results reported by the five integrated supermajors - ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, and Total - might lead some to expect weak results from Aramco. Between them, the oil giants posted a combined record loss of $76 billion in 2020. While most of that loss was caused by asset impairments and write-offs, estimated to be around $69 billion, the real concern for shareholders has been net losses, with ExxonMobil reporting a loss of $22.4 billion, Shell and BP reporting a loss of more than $20 billion, and Total and Chevron reporting net losses of $5 billion to $6 billion. The cost of the global energy transition and the immense pressure to reassess the value of existing reserves or to divest vast parts of operating assets has hit these companies hard. These developments, however, are not an issue Aramco will have to deal with, as the national oil company is not yet adjusting its reserves or divesting its international operational assets. While the Saudi giant is readjusting its overall operations to deal with the global energy transition by entering full-force into hydrogen and unconventionals, it still plans to produce every barrel of oil it can. As a national oil company, Aramco does not have to bow to activist investors or short-term trends. That means oil and gas will remain the main revenue generator for decades to come. Related: Rarely-Used Recovery Method Could Unlock Billions Of Barrels In Alaska The most interesting parts of Aramcos financial report will be the possible changes in its budget, as it has already slashed its CAPEX budget and some major projects have been delayed. Global oil prices have largely recovered this year though, so some analysts are optimistic about Aramcos near-term future. Realistically though, despite being in a league of its own when it comes to production and spare-capacity, the current CAPEX cuts and postponement of major programs will likely be prolonged. Several large international projects have already been halted, such as downstream India, but Aramco will need to keep production in place and possibly even increase spare production capacity to counter possible demand growth in 2022. Aramcos CEO Amin Nasser has already indicated that he is cautiously optimistic about global oil markets, expecting growth in 2022. Expectations, based on the first three quarters of 2020, are that Aramcos FY2020 figures will be lower than in 2019. In Q3 2020, Aramco reported a profit decline of 44.6% to $11.79 billion, compared to $21.29 billion in Q3 2019. The company also slashed its CAPEX 2020 budget to less than $25 billion, which is considered a critical level when considering the investment required to counter production decline. Some analysts expect similar CAPEX budgets for 2021, which would hurt the current bullish sentiment in the oil market. In the short term, it will be Aramcos net profit and its overall margins that drive markets. As the largest oil producer in the world and the main power in the OPEC+ agreement, Aramcos financial stability is a major indicator of the stability of Saudi Arabia and the larger oil market. As the main government revenue generator, the stress on Aramcos financials is immense. Investors and Saudi government officials alike will be very wary of any potential negative news emerging. They will also be worried if Aramcos financials are not healthy enough to deal with the companys CAPEX/OPEX needs while also paying out $75 billion in dividends. If revenues are very low, the dividend issue could start to destabilize the companys future, as cutting CAPEX further would be seen in a very negative light. A potential expansion of production capacity, as was ordered in March 2020 by the Saudi government, has not yet been implemented due to low oil prices and CAPEX cuts. New production expansions, like Marjan, Berri, Safaniya, and Zuluf, have been delayed, while opportunities in the Red Sea offshore are currently still on ice. Aramcos figures will indicate just how strong the oil giants position currently is and whether its production capacity is about to come under pressure. Related Video: Why The Oil & Gas Rig Count Matters At the same time, analysts will be watching closely for any mention from Saudi Aramco officials about the ongoing escalation of the Yemen crisis. Increased drone attacks combined with the new long-range missile capabilities of the Houthis and other Iranian proxies pose a major threat to Aramco. Not only is the escalating Yemeni conflict a major threat to stability in the region, but also to the attractiveness and stability of Aramco. If a concerted drone-missile strategy is put in place, supported by Iran or other forces in the region, Aramcos oil production and export capabilities will be severely hampered. Weaker financial results, Riyadh demanding a higher percentage of revenues, continued instability in the region, and low oil prices are not a cocktail that will attract new investors or financial institutions. Aramco management and the Saud Ministry of Energy will be under pressure to convince markets that Aramco remains strong. The financial world will be watching on Sunday when the companys financials are reported. The attempts by Saudi officials at the moment to highlight substantial changes in the management of the company, major investments in blockchain, hydrogen, and even unconventional energy, are unlikely to be enough to halt the growing concern amongst analysts. Investors and traders will remain painfully aware that the future of Aramco is directly tied to the future of Saudi Arabia. Negative financial reports or assessments will have a tangible impact on the Kingdom itself. Luckily for Saudi entities, the world, even oil traders and hedge funds, are seeking stability at present. That sentiment could mean Aramcos potentially negative report will be viewed in a more positive light. Whatever the result, one thing is certain, all eyes will be on Aramco this Sunday.

Trump administration easing more Obama-era oil and gas rules MATTHEW BROWN Associated Press BILLINGS  The Trump administration is seeking to ease more rules for oil and gas drilling that were adopted under the Obama administration, with the latest changes projected to save energy companies more than $130 million over the next decade. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management proposal would streamline requirements for measuring and reporting oil and gas produced from federal lands. The administrations critics said it marks yet another instance of Trump backtracking on rules that were meant to ensure companies drill responsibly and that the public gets fairly paid for energy extracted from public lands. Under Trump, federal agencies looking to boost domestic energy production have systematically rolled back industry restrictions  from offshore safety rules in the Gulf of Mexico, to measures to protect imperiled species and prevent greenhouse gas pollution. Many of those moves have been challenged in court. Administration officials and industry representatives said the latest changes are meant to reduce the bureaucratic workload faced by smaller oil and gas producers. Many smaller companies have struggled to stay in business amid a drop in demand due to the coronavirus and a recent international dispute that drove down oil prices. The 438-page proposal will be subject to public comment after being published in the federal register. A publication date has not been set, said Bureau of Land Management spokesman Chris Tollefson. This gives the oil and gas industry everything they wanted,"" said Aaron Weiss with the Center for Western Priorities, a Denver-based conservation group. You're leaving open the possibility that taxpayers are not going to get their fair share for oil and gas that's being extracted."" Drilling in the U.S. has slowed dramatically since the arrival of the pandemic and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia thats since been resolved. In Wyoming, for example, a single drilling rig is now operating in the state, versus more than 30 a year ago. As prices come back up and we start ramping up production, anything that can streamline and modernize the way we do things would definitely be helpful,"" said Petroleum Association of Wyoming spokesman Ryan McConnaughey. Bureau of Land Management acting director William Perry Pendley said in a statement that the agency wanted to make sure companies can continue to drill for oil and gas on public lands. Officials cited the changing economics of drilling on federal lands and said the government has leeway to prioritize production over royalties"" that companies pay in order to maximize oil and gas extraction. Onshore oil and gas leases on federal and tribal lands generated almost $3 billion in royalties, rental payments and other revenues in 2018. The money is shared with states and tribes.",https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2020/07/31/trump-administration-easing-more-obama-era-oil-and-gas-rules/5556245002/

244,A&M energy expert optimistic about oil jobs returning to the Brazos Valley,kbtx,"Mar 20, 2021",2021-03-20 01:52:57,"A&M energy economist says oil workers should be optimistic for a return of more jobs and opportunity as the pandemic continues to fade. Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) - West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for the price of crude oil in the U.S., dropped yesterday for the fifth consecutive day. It was the biggest drop in price since September and it gives back promising gains that had pushed the price of gas up over the last few months. But Eric Lewis, an energy economics expert with the Texas A&M Bush School of Government and Public Service with a primary focus is on oil and natural gas, isnt discouraged. I wouldnt be too worried about this drop, Lewis said, I think this is a very short term. He says recent problems with the Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine may have reduced demand in Europe and China, but he says the price of oil has been remarkably resilient. Lewis believes that as more of the population becomes fully vaccinated, more people will feel comfortable traveling and that should increase demand for oil which would drive the price up. According to Petroleum Equipment and Services Association , more than 100,000 oil and gas jobs have been lost because of the pandemic, 50,000 of them right here in Texas. Lewis says those jobs should return in time. So were certainly not going to see all 100,000 jobs return right away, Lewis said, but I think we can be pretty optimistic that the industry is going to be hiring more and more people over time so we will see a return of those jobs. I think theres a great cause for optimism for those folks who are employed in that area. As of market close on Friday, the price for a barrel of oil was in the low $60 range Lewis said he believes prices need to increase before companies can profitably resume drilling new sites. We see a lot more drilling especially in Texas when we see prices getting a bit higher in the $70-$80 range, Lewis said. But he explains that there are already drilled sites that are almost finished that create jobs even sooner than new sites. A lot of times firms would drill but they wouldnt do what we call completing the wells, Lewis said, we will have some increased production as those drilled but uncompleted wells now get completed so we actually start to get production. All considered, he said the oil industry will emerge and likely return to pre-pandemic production and employment levels. I think we really can be optimistic that there will be a return, and I think thats really driven by the fact that the major reason for a recession was because of the pandemic and so as the vaccine comes out, as people get vaccinated, as travel restrictions ended, as people get more comfortable with traveling, we will see.

245,The Oil and Gas Industry Is Fighting North Face for Some Reason,gizmodo,"Mar 19, 2021",2021-03-19 18:55:00,"The North Face has become the oil industrys new favourite brand to hate. It all started back in December, when Innovex Downhole Solutions, a Worn Out: The Fashion Industrys Big Oil Problem I really like buying clothes. I spend countless hours in the middle of the night scrolling my favourite brands Instagram feeds, and though I try to stick to buying secondhand, I also definitely set myself alarms to remember sample sales. Embarrassing, I know. Read more The kerfluffle generated a bit of right wingpress in December, but it didnt stop there. Earlier this month, the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, a state fossil fuel advocacy group, held a fake awards ceremony where it mockingly bestowed an extraordinary customer award on North Face, emphasising the role of oil and gas plays in North Faces products and the outdoor industry. The whole half-hour thing is on YouTube and I have to hand it to them: Its a really incredible show of pettiness, complete with a slideshow of stock photos to illustrate how oil and gas plays a role in the outdoor industry. Why get mad at these people? Theyre our customers, Alex Cranberg, the chairman of the oil and gas company Aspect Energy, snarked at one point. They may not appreciate how valuable our product is, but I think we should appreciate North Face and all the other companies that use our products to make the world a better place. This sort of own-the-libs gotcha-ism is a classic conservative narrative arc. But the whole saga holds some clues about to techniques the fossil fuel industry may adopt at a wider scale as it faces more scrutiny and pressure due to its role in causing the climate crisis. The industry is increasingly leaning into the messaging that its products make life better: During the faux award show, Dan Haley, the Colorado Oil and Gas Associations president and CEO, shared images of people enjoying the outdoors with arrows pointing to everything made of oil from kayaks to hiking gear. And the group isnt letting up on the approach anytime soon. In fact, its using the North Face kerfuffle as a springboard for a campaign called Fuelling Our Lives. Haley told industry publisher Hart Energythat he hopes the campaign will connect oil and gas, for Coloradans, with the products they use every day. Historically, the North Face has been kind of late to the game in embracing its role as a brand in figuring out what were going to do about climate change. Thats particularly true, as CNBC reported in August compared to its direct competitor Patagonia. And the companys decision does feel a little amateur: If youre going to have morals on who you sell to, you might want to back them up with a little more work on your corporate sustainability Though some brands may be trying to change course, theyre not there yet (and in the North Faces case, some of the changes seem more PR than systemic). That means this type of attack by the oil and gas industry can really hit home. But its hardly just the outdoor industry that the oil and gas industry is hitching its horse to. Tom Pyle, another presenter at the fake award ceremony (who also helped head former President Donald Trumps energy transitionand runs the American Energy Alliance), waxed on about how the coronavirus vaccine would have been impossible without oil and gas. What these attacks reveal, though, is something deeper about the industry itself as well as the challenges of ending our relationship with fossil fuels. Yes, the oil executives are right. Your North Face jacket is made of oil; your ski trips run on oil; pretty much everything in your life runs on oil, and theres not a lot you as an individual can do about it. But thats because oil and gas companies have worked for decades to ingrain themselves into the fabric of society and amp up the value of their product by lying fending off competitors buying off politicians and creating new demand streams for their products (look no further than the coming plastics boomtriggered simply from excess oil produced by the industry). Were only now just coming to terms with the enormous costs from decades of fossil fuel use  and the fossil fuel industrys disinformation campaign are part of the reason why we allowed so much of our world to become reliant on their product, with few available alternatives. And its no surprise that politicians who get money from the industryare continually painting fossil fuels as necessaryas a way to block needed progress on transitioning off them, parroting the same messages Innovexs president and the Colorado Oil and Gas Association are now pushing. Its a looped messaging system of whataboutism, designed to fend off any accountability or the changes need to avert more damage to the climate. Its up to us to not let them  or even brands that rely on them like North Face  off the hook.

These studies underscore the critical importance of the oil and gas industry to our states budget, economy and communities, as well as the need for state and federal policies that encourage responsible development of our abundant mineral resources, Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford said during a press conference with those who conducted the studies. North Dakota State University researchers Dean Bangsund and Nancy Hodur studied the economic contribution of oil and gas exploration, extraction, transportation, processing and capital investments in 2019, the most recent data available. Similar studies have been conducted every two years since 2005. Their findings show North Dakotas oil and gas industry directly employed nearly 24,000 people in 2019, while economic activity from the indirect and induced effects of the industry supported an additional 17,000 and 18,000 jobs, respectively, for a total of 59,100 jobs attributed to the industry. Employment compensation, which includes wages, salaries and employee benefits, was estimated at $4.5 billion. Total gross business volume, which includes direct sales in the oil and gas industry and business generated from indirect and induced economic activity throughout North Dakota, was estimated at $40.2 billion  an increase of $7.5 billion over 2017 and more than a quarter of the states overall business volume. Bangsund said that while the COVID-19 pandemic certainly made 2020 a challenging year, the good news is that the oil and gas industry has become much more efficient in exploration and production and is expected to rebound quickly as it did from the last downturn. What we've learned over the last decade is that the North Dakota oil and natural gas industry is incredibly resilient, said Bangsund, research scientist in agribusiness and applied economics at NDSU. Regardless of market conditions, it continues to be a major force in our state's economy. From fiscal years 2008 to 2020, tax revenues from the oil and gas industry in North Dakota totaled nearly $22 billion, according to a study conducted for the Western Dakota Energy Association and North Dakota Petroleum Council. Those revenues supported $8.2 billion for local communities and infrastructure, nearly $1.6 billion for K-12 education, over $1.2 billion for water and flood control projects, $879 million for local transportation projects, $440 million for property tax relief and $29 million for outdoor heritage projects across the state. Our report shows that every county in North Dakota continues to receive revenue derived from the states oil and natural gas production and extraction taxes, said Brent Bogar, senior consultant for engineering and consulting firm AE2S, who led the study. From the $8 billion Legacy Fund to K-12 education and infrastructure funding, the industrys impact will be felt across North Dakota for generations to come. Officials hope the studies will help inform leaders in Washington, D.C., as well as the North Dakota Legislature as it continues to craft policies and the budget for the 2021-23 biennium. As elected officials set policies and issue orders directly affecting the livelihoods of tens of thousands of North Dakotans, its crucial they understand the tremendous impact of the oil and gas industry on our state and on our countrys energy independence and national security, Gov. Doug Burgum said. K. William Boyer is the Managing Editor of the Devils Lake News Journal. He can be reached at kboyer@gannett.com, or by phone at (701) 662-2127.

While oilfield service suppliers have taken considerable steps to make structural changes and diversify, 2020s financial results suggest more needs to be done. Renewables capex, which equals purchases from supply firms, is set for another record year, picking up where last year left off, when spending hit $224 billion. By contrast, oil and gas capex this year is expected to stay in line with 2020s $306 billion  a far cry from the industrys better days, as just in 2019 E&Ps splurged $422 billion on supply purchases. The spending gap between renewable energy and oil and gas is closing, as capex for renewables is now just 22% below the estimate for upstream projects. Most of the renewable energy spending will go towards onshore wind projects, rising to $100 billion from $94 billion in 2020. Solar PV spending is expected to climb to $96 billion this year from $88 billion last year, while offshore wind will see capex grow to $46 billion from $43 billion. Most of the expenditure stems from Asia, which has 156 gigawatts (GW) of capacity under construction as of January 2021, followed by Europe with 32 GW. Chinas decision to slowly reduce subsidy assistance from January forced many projects to start construction early, which further supported spending activity. Much of the spending is down to Chinas 800-megawatt (MW) Rudong offshore wind farm and the 2 GW Zhuozi County Project, as well as Orsteds 1.4 GW Hornsea 2 project off the UK. Upstream capex is expected to increase by less than 2% in 2021, with spending on greenfield projects declining by 6%. However, sanctioning activity is estimated to increase this year by 30%, mainly due to Qatargas $30 billion North Field East development, which makes up 33% of the total budget to be sanctioned this year. Last years events forced leading oil and gas businesses to look at strategies to reduce exposure to the risky market amid the energy transition. Oilfield service suppliers, for instance, have started a considerable transformation, hoping to be more relevant in a greener market and become a more attractive option for investors, says Chinmayi Teggi, energy service analyst at Rystad Energy. After a lamentable 2020, the financial results of some companies suggest more needs to be done. Rystad Energy has compared the revenues of 170 listed suppliers exposed to the upstream oil and gas, wind and solar markets. Our analysis reveals that while oil and gas-focused businesses on average saw revenue drop 23% in 2020 from the previous year, wind and solar PV-focused businesses enjoyed an 18% growth in sales. Quarterly revenue for service companies exposed to the upstream sector has seen a massive deterioration, with fourth-quarter revenue last year slumping 25% from a year earlier amid a lack of new contracts and slow execution of backlog work. Revenue from well services and seismic segments fell last year by 35% from 2019 levels, while drilling tools revenue shrank 25%. However, some positive performance was seen from giants Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Halliburton, driven by a combination of backlog execution improvements and an uptick in US shale activity towards the end of the year. The overall revenue of these companies gained 6% in the fourth quarter from the preceding three months. By contrast, service companies exposed to the wind and solar sectors saw growth in the fourth quarter of last year compared to 2019. Service players exposed to wind projects recorded a 15% year-on-year boost to revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020, with full-year revenues improving by 20%. Sales at service providers exposed to solar projects rose 3% in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period and climbed 14% for the full year. Almost 65% of the wind equipment revenues analyzed  which includes 18 listed companies  is down to the top three suppliers Vestas Wind Systems, General Electric (GE) and Siemens Energy. The companies explored multiple opportunities to increase profitability and reported order intake growth, indicating a fruitful future. Chinese service suppliers, including LONGi Green Energy, Jinko Solar and Trina Solar  companies that also manufacture solar panels  accounted for most of the growth. However, the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent decline in demand last year for photovoltaic systems led to a slowdown in sales in the second half of 2020. Reduced demand, coupled with the price increase of raw materials, brought notable changes to the solar PV industry, including a shift to high-margin orders and efficiency improvements for modules  all in a bid to increase margins. Meanwhile, companies exposed to both oil and gas and renewable energy were able to offset deteriorating conventional revenues with better-performing wind and solar PV-focused segments.

Oil & Gas World may see peak of petrol, diesel demand by 2035 but not India: Petroleum ministry official Fuel demand in years to come will be impacted by factors such as the availability of substitute fuels, the advent of electric vehicles (EVs) and the development of renewable fuels. PTI March 19, 2021, 08:19 IST New Delhi: The world is likely to see peak demand for petrol by the late 2020s and for diesel by 2035, but auto fuels will continue to see growth in India as the economyexpands, a senior petroleum ministryofficial said Thursday. Speaking at the 'India Chem 2021' conference, Sunil Kumar, Joint Secretary (Refinery), Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas said the country will see different energy systems co-exist through the next few decades as demand is expected to remain robust. Fuel demand in years to come will be impacted by factors such as the availability of substitute fuels, the advent of electric vehicles(EVs) and the development of renewable fuels. ""Globally, demand for gasoline (petrol) is expected to peak in the late 2020s and of diesel by 2035,"" he said. However, in India, different energy systems, including fossil fuel, will co-exist over the next few decades. ""Demand for petrol and diesel in India is expected to remain robust in the foreseeable future... at least up to 2040 because our pie is increasing,"" he said. ""India's demand for petrol and diesel will continue to rise despite new sources."" The time till the demand peaks can be used by the country and the oilindustry to prepare for future where crude oil can be converted directly into chemicals instead of the current practice of first it getting turned into fuel. ""Refining and petrochemicals have to have a synergy by sharing of streams and there is a lot of thinking and planning in this regard,"" he said. ""Changing market dynamics clearly indicate that integration of refining and petrochemicals is more of a necessity than a choice"" and is needed for improving margins and remaining competitive. The International Energy Agency (IEA), he said, sees the biggest growth coming from petrochemical feedstock such as ethane, LPG, naphtha, and jet fuel. ""It is estimated these products will account for around 90 per cent of the net increase in total oil product demand through 2040. This contrasts trends from 2000 when gasoline and diesel provided for two-third of growth in oil product."" Global petrochemical is growing at nearly 4 per cent per year, he said. But, India is 40 per cent import-dependent on meeting its chemical needs. India spent Rs 94,000 crore on the import of 35 petrochemicals alone in 2019-20. ""This is when our per capita consumption is only 12 kg against the world average of 37 kg,"" he said, adding as the standard of living rises, the demand for chemicals and petrochemicals will continue to grow. ""And it is assumed as a thumb rule that consumption of petrochemical products grows at 1.5 times that of the growth of India's GDP,"" he said. ""It is believed that India needs a cracker (to produce petrochemicals) every year in the foreseeable future for at least 10 years."" Kumar said India's oil refining capacity will rise from 249 million tonnes per annum now to 300 million tonnes by 2024-25 and 443 million tonnes by 2030. ""Oil demand is expected to grow from 4.4 to 8.7 million barrels per day ie 435 million tonnes per annum. Part of this requirement will also come from the production of petrochemicals as newer refineries are built with higher integration with petrochemicals,"" he said. The petrochemical intensity of the Indian refining industry is expected to increase from 3.5 per cent to 7 per cent by 2030 as all new refineries and expansion are planning to have 15-20 per cent of petrochemical exposure, he said. ""India dependent on imports for a variety of specialised petrochemical products. Production of such niche petrochemicals need to be encouraged through fiscal incentives,"" he said. ""So, in order to become Aatmanirbhar in petrochemical, we need to develop large scale infrastructure for import of alternate feedstock like ethane, LNG, condensate etc to augment available of feedstock.""

Oil and gas production gives rise to large anthropogenic methane emissions from numerous point sources. Methane point sources follow extreme (""fat-tailed"") distributions, meaning that a small number of strong emitters contribute disproportionately to total emissions. This presents an opportunity for effective climate-change mitigation if the strongest point sources can be rapidly identified, repaired, and routinely monitored. Satellite observations of atmospheric methane have unique potential for global and individual monitoring of point sources. I will describe how high-resolution GHGSat-D satellite observations have been used to quantify methane point sources in a Central Asian oil and gas field, and compare facility-scale GHGSat data with regional-scale satellite measurements from TROPOMI. Furthermore, I will show how methane point sources can be quantified using the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 twin satellites with 20-m pixel resolution and revisits every 2-5 days. I will demonstrate this previously unreported capability with examples of point-source monitoring in Turkmenistan and Algeria. REFERENCES Varon, D.

PAW joined the petition after the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which oversees energy and mineral development on federal land, this week didnt hold its quarterly lease sale . The Alliance alleges the agency violated the Mineral Leasing Act by not holding its lease sale for March. PAW also estimates that Wyoming could lose $9.5 million in revenue from the canceled lease sale, according to a news release. While many have tried to spin President Bidens Executive Order as harmless, that narrative is simply false, PAW President Pete Obermueller said in a statement. On average, Wyoming schools could have expected $4 million from this weeks lease sale  enough money to educate 220 Wyoming school children for an entire year. We join this lawsuit to show that the presidents leasing ban has resulted in real harm to Wyoming and those consequences will continue if this ill-advised EO is not overturned. The petition called the lease moratorium both arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. The Court should find the suspension invalid and set aside the challenged government action, it added. A publicly funded report by the Wyoming Energy Authority estimated that a would be a $639.7 billion hit to gross domestic product (GDP) in Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, California, and Alaska by 2040.

Technology Must-Have Technology for Oil and Gas Industry to Reduce Carbon Footprint As the oil and gas industry is increasingly being held to account for its methane footprint, adopting the right technology to detect and stop methane emissions can help it turn this challenge into a golden opportunity. Marion Messador and Antoine Halff, Kayrros Thu, 03/18/2021 - 12:00 PM Your browser does not support the audio element. Proper data has always been key to making change possible. For methane emissions, the technology to detect and measure vented and fugitive methane emissions and trace them back to their sources is now mature and can be cost-effectively scaled up to cover the entire energy supply chain. This technology hasnt come a moment too soon. Regulators all over the world have methane in their crosshairs. First came Europe with its Methane Strategy and the European Green Deal, followed more recently by the U.S. declaration of a climate emergency. One of the first steps taken by the Biden administration has been to call on the EPA to come up with new methane rules by September 2021. Investors, end-users and the general public are all increasingly vocal in their demands that the oil and gas industry must reduce its methane footprint. Until recently, this would have been a tall order. For a long time, oil and gas companies had been unable to take action because of a lack of reliable and comprehensive data on methane emissions. Methane sources are widely dispersed, both in time and in space, and can range from minute leaks to massive releases. With methane being invisible and odorless, companies had to blindly rely on antiquated emission factors to self-report their emissions. Then again, regulators didnt know any better.  Emissions kept increasing. In the last few years, a proliferation of new sensing technologies has cast a spotlight on methane emissions, and in so doing exposed the shortcomings of traditional reporting methods based on inventories and questionable emission factors. These new detection tools run the gamut from ground sensors (stationary and mobile) to aerial surveys (aircraft and drones) to tasking and monitoring satellites. Most of these sensors have a hefty price tag, though, and with very few exceptions can only perform sporadic checks at any one location. Given the multitude of potential sources and the intermittency of emissions, that can be a problem. Thats where monitoring satellites and systems integration come in. Using the power of artificial intelligence, Kayrros has trained algorithms to extract clear, actionable signals from the raw data of monitoring satellites that watch the globe continuously. These data can pick up large methane emissions at any time anywhere in the U.S. and most of the world and help optimize tasking tools by guiding them to their targets. Kayrros combines geospatial data and input from local sensors into an integrated surveillance system that offers the best of both worlds. Figure 1 It is possible to detect, quantify and attribute emissions using high-resolution imagery. (Source: Kayrros analysis of Szzentinel-2 data overlaid on optical image) Kayrros fuses data from Sentinel-5P, which picks up large emissions, and high-resolution satellites such as Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 and PRISMA than can locate a methane source within 30 meters (Figure 1). Using full inversion models and input from high-resolution satellites, Kayrros can attribute large methane events down to the facility and operator level. Kayrros technology can also find additional methane sources, leveraging the lower detection threshold of hi-res satellites and the increased number of measurements. When necessary, the use of mobile sensors can help discriminate between companies operating in the same area when attributing emissions back to their source. Armed with these tools, Kayrros scientists have tracked methane emissions across all major U.S. oil and gas production basins for the past two years. This has led to significant new lessons learned. First, major emissions can go undetected for months. After an aerial campaign conducted by the Environmental Defense Fund in the Permian last September made headlines by spotting a large methane emission event, Kayrros analysis of satellite imagery showed that leak had actually been going on for nearly three months at a rate of up to 11 MMcf/d. Even though aerial campaigns are helpful, only monitoring satellites can systematically detect large anomalous events from the onset and help address them as soon as they occur. Second, while criticism of the industrys methane footprint has been mounting, the actual volume of emissions has been decreasing over the past year. Credit goes in part to producers progress in controlling their emissions and to new takeaway capacity for associated natural gas that has reduced the recourse to flaring and venting. But lower emissions also reflect reduced field activity after the demand shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting price drop. Indeed, as the number of wells put into production started to rebound in the fourth quarter of 2020, so did methane emissionsa trend that continues in 2021 (Figure 2). With regulators around the world more and more concerned about climate change, the industry should prevent a return to the status quo ante and start tackling the issue. The European satellite Sentinel-5P can be used to measure methane emissions across major U.S. oil and gas basins. (Source: Kayrros analysis of Sentinel-5P images) It has all the tools to do so. Monitoring satellites now provide direct measurements at a global scale, with daily revisit time, addressing the critical issue of emission intermittency thanks to their global and continuous coverage. While punctual campaigns can detect fugitive emissions at a given moment and help identify malfunctions across the infrastructure, they do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Making monitoring satellites the cornerstone of any methane monitoring system helps optimize the use of other technologies including tasking satellites, aerial campaigns and ground sensors, which are often more expensive, by guiding them to the right targets. Cost-effectiveness being a necessity for any robust methane monitoring system, using satellites to identify the high-risk areas before leak detection and repair (LDAR) campaigns saves capital and helps reap the low-hanging fruit of emissions abatement. System integration helps overcome the shortcomings of the various technologies currently available, combining the global coverage of monitoring satellites and the spatial resolution and sensitivity of targeted campaigns. This combination is the only way for upstream and midstream operators to credibly show progress towards their emission targets. Although most U.S. companies are not part of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership, using Kayrros technology would qualify them for the OGMP 2.0 frameworks highest reporting standard (Level 5), which requires asset-level di",https://www.hartenergy.com/exclusives/must-have-technology-oil-and-gas-industry-reduce-carbon-footprint-192823

Myanmar unrest saps oil product imports, analysts say By Noah Browning 2 Min Read LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - Violent unrest and sanctions are reducing Myanmars imports of gasoline and other oil products, energy analysts FGE and Vortexa said on Thursday. The widespread unrest has severely impacted businesses in the country, including oil terminal operators, energy consulting firm FGE said. U.S. sanctions have led to foreign banks declining letters of credit from Myanmar banks, which in turn limits trading activities. Furthermore, ongoing protests have obstructed logistical flows and choked ports. The military junta remains unfazed. In the months ahead, even if anti-coup protests were to ease somewhat, it is likely that credit issues due to sanctions will continue to hamper business activities, FGE added. Loadings of oil products bound to Myanmar have fallen to about 180,000 tonnes for the second half of March, according to oil analytics and ship tracking firm Vortexa, compared to nearly 600,000 tonnes for all of January. Gasoil accounts for the most of the fall, followed by gasoline. Most of it is from Singapore and Malaysia, Vortexa added, as well as China, Indonesia and Japan. Myanmars elected leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, was overthrown and detained in a Feb. 1 military coup that has triggered mass protests.

On Aug. 26, the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposed a lease sale of about 3,263 acres of public lands in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, with most of the sale occurring in southeast New Mexicos Permian Basin region. The BLM also planned to sell leases to about 45,445 acres of federal land also in southeast New Mexico to the oil and gas industry  a sale that was postponed in May due to difficulties associated with the pandemic. At its last lease sale, the BLM sold about 17,024 acres of federal land to oil and gas operators in its Feb. 6 sale, on 68 parcels in New Mexico and Oklahoma. The sale raised about $20.4 million, with the highest per-acre bid going to Federal Abstract Company at $31,680 per acre for about 321 acres in Eddy County. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. But Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, said the same market and public health problems that led to the May sales postponement were still present in August and that the lease sales should be delayed further. Holding that sale just makes no sense, Prentice-Dunn said. The industry is in freefall and it's not like the industry has a lack of mineral rights to drill on. Its really bad for the taxpayer. These are public mineral rights and should be leased responsibly. Prentice-Dunn argued that as the market struggled with low oil prices and shrinking rig counts  New Mexico was reported to have its lowest count of the year this month at about 45 reported on Friday compared with 111 a year ago  oil companies would offer significantly lower bids. More: Trump admin. curbs federal oil and gas emissions standards. Here's where New Mexico stands Oil and gas lease sales should be discontinued, he said, until the market recovers, and New Mexico taxpayers can get a fair rate for public land. Theyve already postponed lease sales earlier this year due to market conditions, Prentice-Dunn said. They should do that again. Bidding is likely to be depressed compared to what it was during a more robust time in the market. But Robert McEntyre, spokesman for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said the long-term return for leases of public land to the extraction industry would remain solid despite the markets recent downturn. More: New Mexico's oil and gas water regulations criticized by environmentalists He said that when the market recovers, producers will be able to better develop oil and gas resources using the leases acquired during the bust and generate more revenue for the state to counteract any potentially lower-than-normal bids. When the industry is in a downturn, these resources will continue to be there, McEntyre said. Developing our federal resources is not only good for New Mexico, it allows companies to create significant revenue for the state. Ensuring the BLM holds regular lease sales is important to our economy and our future. And after the industry recovers from the pandemic, McEntyre argued the federal government would likely charge higher royalties on extraction activities taking place on federal lands, thus creating more long-term revenue for the state and its taxpayers. More: Oil and gas impacts cited in possible listing of dunes sagebrush lizard as endangered Historically, these assets produce the most return over several years, not necessarily right up front when the lease is sold, he said. The federal government will receive an adequate return over several years. But any notable recovery from the industry will wait until the pandemic subsides, as the industrys success is largely dependent on fuel demand which was slashed during the health crisis and subsequent travel restrictions. The industrys recovery will closely follow the pandemics recovery, McEntyre said. Prices seem to be responding to some of the production curtailments since early spring. But our recovery is heavily dependent on our ability to recover from the pandemic and restore peoples ability to return to some form of normal life. ""But the geology has not changed. The longer-term value of those resources has not changed. More: New Mexico oil and gas methane regulations criticized for 'loop holes' At the New Mexico State Land Office, the agency chose to go another route. Rather than building up oil and gas developments in expectation for the markets recovery, Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard said the downturn proved an opportunity to diversify New Mexicos land management economy so it wont be as financially devastated by the next bust. Oil and gas continued to represent about 90 percent of the Land Offices receipts, down from 94 percent last year, and marked a 5 percent decline in royalty payments from $899 million in fiscal year 2019 to $854 million in FY 2020. More: Chevron uses renewables to power oil and gas operations, market shows signs of recovery Meanwhile, the Land Office reported a 118 percent increase in revenue from wind energy, from $406,685 in FY 2019 to $885,273 in FY 2020. And rights of way easement payments were up 58 percent from $24.7 million last year to $39 million in FY 2020. Although oil and gas remained the primary revenue driver for the state, Garcia Richard said her office intended to continue diversifying its revenue sources to include more renewable energy that could protect the state from future drops in oil prices. More: Concho Resources, Solaris expand oil and gas water operations in Permian Basin And the markets decline was expected to more negatively impact FY 2021s revenue, Garcia Richard said, which would likely not see that $1 billion incomes enjoyed in FY 2019 and 2020 when the oil and gas industry was healthier. Its important for the Land Office to be seen as a consistent source of income for the institutions that we support, she said. We are working hard to diversify our revenue sources to assure that if we see future decreases in the price of oil like we did this year, other activities are thriving so that the beneficiaries dont take a hit.

Leslie Oil and Gas Investor Thu, 03/18/2021 - 03:00 AM [Editor's note: A version of this story appears in the March 2021 issue of Oil and Gas Investor magazine.] Energy-focused private equity funds always scout around for the next way to hit a home run. Beyond shale plays, digitalization or M&A, today many private equity scouts are chasing alternative energy opportunities, and that means a lot more than backing gas producers to feed a power plant. Several factors are driving their march toward a greener portfolio. Last year, as a Biden presidency came into view and the energy transition became the talk of the town, public and private investors increasingly turned to renewable energy (solar, wind, biogas) or energy transition ideas (electric vehicles [EVs], battery storage, distributed power generation). Whether valuations are realistic or not in todays heated atmosphere, many of the biggest private equity firms for energy believe in an all of the above approach and thus have invested in alternatives for several years, usually led by a separate in-house origination team using dedicated capital that is separate from their oil and gas funds.

Oil & Gas Oil supertankers losing millions are a bullish vaccine trade The coronavirus has ravaged both global oil demand and supply, rendering the fees that owners charge for individual cargo deliveries little short of disastrous. Bloomberg March 18, 2021, 11:21 IST The market for moving oilacross the worlds oceans is currently so bad that owners of the industrys biggest supertankersare actually subsidizing the delivery of cargoes. Strange to think, then, that shares of two of the markets biggest pureplay owners -- Euronav NV and Frontline Ltd. -- have been steadily rallying since early February. Its because the oil tanker sector is emerging as a hot coronavirus vaccineplay. The coronavirus has ravaged both global oil demand and supply, rendering the fees that owners charge for individual cargo deliveries little short of disastrous. But industry executives, shipbrokers and analysts all say theres reason to be bullish: the more oil is kept off the market now, the harder the snapback will be as vaccination programs help to revive global oil demand -- and with it the flow of cargoes. We are probably never going to experience a demand increase similar to what we are likely to see over the next nine months for tankers, said Eirik Haavaldsen, a shipping analyst at Pareto Securities AS in Oslo. Six months down the road, we will have higher OPEC+ production because the world is going to consume a lot more oil as vaccines take effect and economies recover. Coming Back Its an optimism that already filtered into the oil market. Banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Citigroup Inc.and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. have all hiked their crude-price forecasts over the past few months in anticipation of stellar summer demand as vaccination programs take effect. The International Energy Agencysays world oil consumption will be back approaching 100 million barrels a day by the end of the year, about 6% higher than the first quarter. In a report Wednesday, the agency said OPEC+ could quickly bring supply back if oil markets tighten. For now though, rates for the industrys biggest tankers are in the doldrums. OPEC and its allies surprised markets earlier this month, by keeping existing output cuts for at least a month longer than the oil market had been anticipating. Oil tankers competing to move 2-million-barrel cargoes from the Middle East to China have lost an average of about $2,800 a day in the so-called on-the-spot charter market since the start of February, data from the Baltic Exchange data show. That compares with earnings of about $250,000 a day a year ago, when a downturn in the oil market had oil traders storing fuels at sea on every type of vessel that they could find. Other parts of the shipping market are already strengthening. The Baltic Dry Index, a gauge of ships hauling commodities like coal and iron ore is at a five-month high, while container shipping rates have also soared amid a spate of global inventory restocking. There are signs that tanker owners are waiting it out for better times too. Normally, such catastrophic earnings would reshape the supply of vessels, with ships either being scrapped on the beaches of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, or sitting idle in bays and harbors off the coasts of countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. So far, theres little sign of either happening -- despite ships having their highest scrap values since late 2014. But there are also relatively few new vessels being built either, further reducing the incentive for some owners to succumb to weak rates now. The outlook for vessel supply is the most bullish since 2003, according to Frode Morkedal, an analyst at Clarksons Platou AS, a unit of the worlds biggest shipbroker. And the prospects for demand look positive too. Shipping is a leveraged bet on the world economy and commodity prices, analysts including Morkedal said.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 18  Malaysias oil and gas industry is in the recovery cycle this year as several sectors within the industry are expected to chart gradual recovery such as engineering, procurement, construction, installation, and commissioning (EPCIC), said AmInvestment Bank Bhd. The investment bank said among the sectors was rising EPCIC would be driven by several activities, including pipeline installations growing by 4.2x to a base-case of 266 days in 2023 from 64 days in 2021 as more development projects tie in to existing platforms or processing facilities. Decommissioning of wells increase to 18 this year from 15 in 2020, which will rise further to 24 in 2022 and expand to remove 51 conductors, two floaters and one fixed platform, it said in a research note Thursday. AmInvestment Bank said currently, 56 per cent of Petronas 350 facilities were operating beyond the assets design life, 38 per cent of the 750 pipelines, while 45 per cent of the 3,000 wells were idle with over 500 wells were expected to be permanently plugged by 2030. The investment bank also notes that Sapura Energy Bhds integrated service platform was well positioned to secure these jobs, given the groups under-utilised heavy installation vessels currently, while former local EPCIC players such as Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd was still under PN17 status. It noted that higher vessel demand to support drilling and projects, rising to 172 this year from 141 in 2020 should support operators such as Icon Offshore Bhd, Perdana Petroleum Bhd and Alam Maritim Resources Bhd. Even so, this still represents a 33 per cent decrease from the earlier 2020 plan for 256 vessels notwithstanding Petronas prioritisation of local ships. However, vessel requirement to support production operations is relatively flat year-on-year at 131 vessels this year, said AmInvestment Bank. It added that the number of rigs expected to rebound to 22 in 2021 from 14 in the second half of 2020 due to plummeting oil prices and the movement control order. While this is below the earlier 2020 target of 26 rigs, we expect Velesto Energy Bhd to experience improving asset utilisation towards the second half of the year, said AmInvestment Bank. However, some segments could still struggle as hook-up and commissioning activities will decline this year by 20 per cent year-on-year to 3.5 million man-hours due to resource limitation and Petronas optimisation plan to uberise marine vessels onto a single digital platform. Likewise, offshore maintenance and construction is expected to decline by 10 per cent year-on-year to 10.1 million man-hours.

""There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,"" she said during a 2019 town hall event on climate change hosted by CNN. ""This is something I've taken on in California. I have a history of working on this issue. We have to just acknowledge that the residual impact of fracking is enormous in terms of the impact on the health and safety of communities.""

If elected, he planned to end some subsidies for oil and gas companies while also placing a ban on oil and gas leasing on public lands. More: Joe Biden vows to ban oil and gas drilling if elected President, draws scorn from industry The Biden campaign challenged assertions made this summer by the Trump campaign that the former-Vice President favored a full-on ban on fracking, but some New Mexico industry advocates said his selection of Harris cemented the challenger's policy positions that could be devastating to the industry and economy of the state. Larry Behrens, the New Mexico-based western states director for Power the Future, an industry-advocacy group said Biden and Harris' energy policies would be ""devastating"" to New Mexico. He said a ban on fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, could risk more than 100,000 jobs and billions of dollars in revenue for New Mexico schools, infrastructure and public safety. Opinion: Oil lobbyist drills into political rock Sadly, a fracking ban is no longer an idea from fringe candidate, its now the centerpiece of a major candidates campaign and New Mexicans should be worried, Behrens said. Every New Mexico official who has endorsed Joe Biden should now have to answer if they support the extreme position of banning fracking and destroying our economy.

It was unclear the ratio of Democrats and Republicans surveyed. More than 70 percent of voters polled believed oil and gas to be a significant industry in meeting the U.S. energy needs for the next two decades, the study read, and 67 percent of Democrats polled believed the industry will play an important role in economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we approach the election, it is clear a majority of New Mexico voters know and support the critical role the natural gas and oil industry plays in driving the economic recovery, keeping energy costs low and protecting national security, said API President Mike Sommers.

Wikiwell website shows oil and gas well history SR Sean Feagan, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter Strathmore Times timer 2 min. read A website providing information about oil and gas wells throughout North America now has more Alberta wells, allowing landowners to check the history and status of wells in and around their properties. WellWiki.org was created by Joel Gehman, a professor of strategy, entrepreneurship and management at the University of Alberta School of Business. The project started when Gehman was working on his PhD at Pennsylvania State University and became interested in the oil and gas industry, then taking off there with the advent of fracking. He started to compile data on wells and continued this focus after moving to the University of Alberta in 2012. As part of a grant application, Gehman proposed to create a website allowing members of the public to access the information he worked to compile. He won the grant and spent parts of 2013 and 2014 building a prototype of the site. Since then, he has worked to expand the site and increase its coverage. WellWiki.org now includes over 4.3 million wells drilled by almost 136,000 producers. By his estimates, there are 5.8 million wells in North America. So about a million and a half to go, he said. Each U.S. state and Canadian province also has its own rules and regulations for the oil and gas industry, influencing how information is categorized, stored and accessed. Theres a whole wide variety of ways of how we find the data, said Gehman. The more recent wells are, the more likely they are in the database. Some of the oldest wells, drilled before regulations or regulators, might not be included. The record for each well contains its unique well identifier (UWI) number, operator, legal land location and license status, among other information. Each well has a unique page, providing a map and details of its history and production output. With support by the Alberta Real Estate Foundation, Gehman was able to expand the sites coverage in Alberta. This was done to make oil and gas well data more accessible to landowners, municipalities and other stakeholders across Alberta. Alberta features 619,503 wells in the database drilled by 18,015 producers. Thats every well the regulator knows exists, said Gehman. But there was some early activity back at the start of the early 1900s, so its very possible there are some wells that never got recorded. Wheatland County, Alberta, contains 18,110 wells in the dataset. The top three producers in the county account for about 86 per cent of its wells. These include Lynx Energy ULC (8,014 wells or about 44 per cent), Torxen Energy Ltd. (4,400 wells or about 24 per cent) and Ember Resources Inc. (3,256 wells or about 18 per cent).

Adrian Hedden Carlsbad Current-Argus The federal government made about $8.2 million from a sale of public land to the oil and gas industry in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. The sale was held by the Bureau of Land Management on Aug. 26 and 27 and offered 113 parcels on about 48,778 acres of land in the three states. About 45,405 acres of the sale were from the BLMs May lease sale which was postponed along with 2,866 new acres offered for the August sale. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. On Aug. 26, the new acreage generated about $1.3 million with the highest bid per acre at $1,401 and the highest bid per parcel at $896,640. The next day saw the sales highest bid per acre at $21,512 for a 120-acre parcel in Eddy County to Federal Abstract Company. That same parcel also received the highest bid per parcel for a total of about $2.6 million. More: New Mexico oil and gas rig counts continue drop; industry to see gradual recovery in 2020 Overall, the second day of the sale which offered the parcels postponed from May generated about $7 million. BLM leases are awarded for 10-year terms and as long after the term that the land generates oil and natural gas. If activities on the land results in oil or gas production, revenue from royalties paid to the BLM is shared with the states. More: Oil and gas leases sales continue in New Mexico despite industry downturn during COVID-19 States receive about half of the royalties, per a statement from the BLM. The BLMs policy is to promote oil and gas development if it meets the guidelines and regulations set forth by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other subsequent laws, the statement read. The sales are also in keeping with the America First Energy Plan, which is an all-of-the-above plan that includes oil and gas, coal, strategic minerals, and renewable sources such as wind, geothermal and solar, all of which can be developed on public lands. More: Trump admin. curbs federal oil and gas emissions standards. Here's where New Mexico stands But New Mexico environmental groups questioned if the states taxpayers were truly getting their fair share of the profits and the value of public land. Opponents of the oil and gas production on public land argued the lease sales should be postponed indefinitely amid the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent downturn in the fossil fuel industry. The price per barrel of domestic oil continued to stagnate between about $42 and $40 per barrel, well below the $50 to $60 pre-pandemic price range, per data from Nasdaq. More: New Mexico oil and gas advocates criticize Democrat presidential ticket's fracking stance Meanwhile New Mexicos count of active oil and gas rigs fell dramatically during the health crisis from an average of 114 in March when the pandemic first spread to the state to an average of 46 in August. Texas average rig count also fell during the pandemic from an average of 394 in March down to 105 in August. During the downturn in production and lower price environment, President of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship David Jenkins said the industry was able to acquire public land for much less than it was worth. More: New Mexico oil and gas market could take 3 more years to recover He said the current downturn in the market let to a lower market value for the land, compared with recent years when production boomed in the Permian Basin. The administration of President Donald Trump, Jenkins said, was more interested in providing land to the industry that conserving natural resources. At this latest sale, oil companies were able to scarf up leases for a tiny fraction of what they would normally go for, denying New Mexico and the American taxpayer anything close to a reasonable return, Jenkins said. Such dismal results are predictable, given the Trump administrations baffling inability to read and respond to market conditions. This sale ended up being nothing but a massive give away to oil companiesone that comes at the expense of every other American and our national public lands. More: New Mexico's oil and gas water regulations criticized by environmentalists Judy Calman, director of policy for Audubon Southwest argued the health crisis could lead to delays in environmental oversight and public input and the BLM should delay future land sales until the pandemic subsided. She also worried much of the land offered in the sale was near wildlife corridors and other areas of concern. ""It's outrageous that the BLM continues to hold oil and gas lease sales each quarter in the middle of a pandemic, Calman said. Not only do some of these areas overlap critical habitat for birds and game species which will be irreparably harmed once developed, the COVID crisis is also causing delays and sometimes outright halting of enforcement of environmental laws, as well as impeding the public's ability to participate in agency decision-making. More: Oil and gas impacts cited in possible listing of dunes sagebrush lizard as endangered And Phil Francis, chair of the Coalition to Protect Americas parks contended the sale could threaten sensitive areas such as Carlsbad Caverns, which provides a unique wildlife experience for visitors but also supports karstic aquifers that supply much of the regions groundwater. ""This jeopardizes not only animal migration and critical species habitat, it puts the irreplaceable natural and cultural resources at Carlsbad Caverns itself at risk, Francis said. Leasing public land for oil and gas drilling on the doorstep of our national parks is never okay, but continuing to hold lease sales during a pandemic, when the ability of the public to comment on these sales is hindered, is completely unacceptable. More: New Mexico oil and gas methane regulations criticized for 'loop holes' Robert McEntyre, spokesman for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association responded that oil and gas companies purchasing land during the market downturn would put them in a stronger position to produce oil and gas when the market recovers. He said this would result in taxpayers getting a better return on the land than if the sales were postponed. Developing our federal resources is not only good for New Mexico, it allows companies to create significant revenue for the state. Ensuring the BLM holds regular lease sales is important to our economy and our future, McEntyre said. Historically, these assets produce the most return over several years, not necessarily right up front when the lease is sold. The federal government will receive an adequate return over several years.

264,Oil and Gas Charter Flight Demand Surging |Rigzone,rigzone,"Mar 17, 2021",2021-03-17 09:39:41,"A global aircraft charter broker reports that charter flights for oil and gas crews are soaring. PHOTO SOURCE: ACS Tweet A global aircraft charter broker reports that charter flights for oil and gas crews are soaring. PHOTO SOURCE: ACS Thanks to disruptions in commercial aviation, bookings for charter flights for oil and gas crews have risen dramatically, according to the global aircraft charter broker Air Charter Service (ACS). ACS recently reported triple-digit-percentage increases in workforce logistics flight bookings and inquiries from energy, oil, gas, and mining companies. The firm stated that inquiries have risen 145% and bookings 120% year-over-year. Moreover, the company expects the surge to continue as oil and gas firms seek to ensure long-term connectivity for crews traveling to and from operations worldwide. It is evident that commercial flight schedules may take a number of years to return to their original, pre-pandemic capacity, ACS observed in a written statement emailed to Rigzone. The near collapse in demand for business travel, as well as the leisure sector, during the pandemic has impacted the number of routes, frequency and size of aircraft being used. ACS Group Commercial Jets Director Matthew Purton pointed out that oil and gas clients will continue to face limited options to fly commercially given the more niche routes upon which they frequently rely. Moreover, he said that multiple companies are increasingly consolidating personnel onto one flight to make chartering a more viable option. Purton also informed Rigzone about regions where bookings have been particularly robust. There has always been an African market, but we are now receiving even more requests between South America and Africa, as well as Australian companies looking for movements around Africa, he said. Panama has been a common request, as well as workers originating in The Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand traveling to Europe or Africa. In addition, Purton referenced places that companies are seeking to avoid given coronavirus-related developments. We have seen a surge in requests to try and bypass countries linked to COVID mutations or countries that require quarantine at the end destination, he explained. An example would be avoiding the UAE, which has restrictions on arrival to the U.K. even if there is a transit stop at Dubai, for example.

Try refreshing your browser. How do oil and gas companies get away with it? Back to video $3.2 million in unpaid property taxes owed by oil and gas companies?  How do those companies get away with this?  How are our farmers and country folk going to travel on good and well maintained county roads? Recovering these delinquencies and unpaid taxes from other property owners who already pay too much tax in almost every area of our lives and businesses? Municipalities must pay the province the assessments (money?) regardless of whether or not the oil and gas industry pays? The county wrote off nearly $2 million in unpaid taxes instead of foreclosing on the leases just to get the Province to pay for Provincial government relief and then everyone else to pay higher provincial taxes? The Province helped the oil and gas industry to stop paying drilling fees to counties without the power to prevent drilling until unpaid tax assessments are paid by the oil and gas industry? The Province is ready to work with both municipalities and industry to solve these issue(s) so municipalities (can) collect unpaid taxes and the oil and gas industry can contribute in a fair and equitable manner? Oil and gas industries are not parents, like farmers dealing with fairness and equality issues when it comes to the farms future ; the oil and gas industry is a provider with power to do as they please so long as the Province via taxpayers are there to bail them out.   Like not requiring them to pay linear assessments that both counties and municipalities depend on, but laying these taxes on municipal citizens that can ill-afford to pay them.  Perhaps the Province should look at cutting back on the size of their bureaucracy, make the oil and gas industry pay their bills, continue to cut red tape, and start moving more forward into cleaner and greener consumable food products like unadulterated honey and less sugar production, more greenhouses, hot houses, etc; farmers could achieve critical mass without government support if they got the tax breaks that the oil and gas industry gets.  Farmers would like to make more money on the money they earn, and begin to be price makers (like the oil and gas industry) instead of price takers despite their carbon footprint. Advertisement This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content People like me  regular tax payers  are getting tired of bailing out big business at taxpayers expense without the power to influence governments and government decisions. Fair is requiring the oil and gas industry to pay its taxes on current leases, or they dont get to drill. Equitable is the county foreclosing on leases and encouraging other energy providers with the opportunity to use those leases for thermal, hydrogen and other forms of renewable energy so as to build hot houses and greenhouses for more local food production. We will always need traditional energy production but not at the expense of taxpayers. Can the provincial government comment please?

268,Opinion: Oil and gas industry are good for Ohio communities despite report,dispatch,"Mar 17, 2021",2021-03-17 06:20:00,"Three county commissioners say the oil and gas industries are good for Ohio communities Rebuttal: Oil and gas industry are good for Ohio communities despite report Jerry Echemann, Skip Gardner and Paul Coffland Guest Columnists From the car dealers selling vehicles so quickly they can barely keep up with demand, to the construction crews who are as busy as they have ever been, area businesses in Ohios shale country are thriving thanks to the investments and economic activity being generated by the oil and gas industry. As commissioners from these counties, we see how the industry is benefitting our communities and constituents every day. More: That is why we were stunned to see a recent article in The Dispatch argue that the oil and gas industry has not been an economically uplifting force in our communities. The February article, "" Report: Ohio fracking counties saw declines in jobs, population and income ,"" blatantly distorted and misrepresented facts while detailing a report by the Ohio River Valley Institute an organization of radical activists whose main purpose is to promote renewable energy sources. The facts are that the oil and gas industry has invested more than $60 billion in Ohio to support upstream activities such as drilling, extraction and leasing since 2011. That number comes from  a report out of Cleveland State University which was commissioned by JobsOhio.That same report showed that from July 2019 to December 2019, the industry invested more than $400 million in Belmont County alone. Let that sink in, $400 million in one county in just six months. In that same time period the industry invested $206,280,000 in Harrison County and $168,480,000 in Guernsey County. The report also indicates that the industry has provided more than $1 billion to build and repair roads since 2011. Jack Kleinhenz, a nationally recognized economist, issued a similar report in January 2020, which was commissioned by the Ohio Oil and Gas Energy Education Program. His report showed that in 2018 the industry paid $1.1 billion in taxes and royalties. More than 92% of the taxes and royalties paid by the industry go to local governments and landowners, with the remainder being paid to the state. The report also showed that Belmont, Carroll, Columbiana, Guernsey, Harrison, Jefferson, Monroe, Noble and Washington counties saw a combined $1.6 billion in labor income in 2018 thanks to the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, as of 2018, the industry was directly responsible for or actively supporting 37,256 Ohio jobs  largely in shale counties. Reports by the American Petroleum Institute, Ohio Oil and Gas Association, Shale Crescent USA and others all tell the same story. The oil and gas industry is investing enormous sums in eastern Ohio. Their investment is generating tens of thousands of well-paying jobs, significant tax revenues for our schools, roads and local governments, and tens of billions of dollars in economic activity for our state. The numbers are clear, the oil and gas industry is an economic engine in eastern Ohio. The shale boom has made our communities more prosperous than they have ever been, and you dont have to take our word for it. We invite anyone who wants to see for themselves to visit our counties and spend some time speaking to the locals. It wont take you long to find first-hand accounts of folks benefiting from the enormous investments being made by the oil and gas industry in eastern Ohio. Jerry Echemann, Skip Gardner and Paul Coffland are county commissioners in Belmont, Guernsey and Harrison counties, respectively.

269,New Mexico's leaders call for Biden to end oil and gas restrictions,currentargus,"Mar 17, 2021",2021-03-17 03:42:00,"New Mexico's two Democrat U.S. senators and governor warned Biden's efforts to slow oil and gas operations could have dire impacts on the state. View Comments A controversial executive action from the administration of President Joe Biden that restricted some oil and gas activity on federal land was set to expire on Sunday, as authority over oil and gas permits and other approvals was returned to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and its local field offices. On Jan. 20, acting Interior secretary Scott de la Vega suspended the authority of sub-agencies within the Department like the BLM to make needed approvals for oil and gas operations such as permits to drill, tie into pipelines and rights of way need to transport oil and natural gas. The order meant such decisions were to be made at the cabinet level  effectively slowing the process and restricting the ability of field offices to work directly with local operators. More: Deb Haaland to lead Interior amid concerns from New Mexico oil and gas industry The order was set for 60 days, and an Interior spokesperson confirmed to the Current-Argus on Tuesday that it would not be renewed. Biden himself also enacted an executive order to place a temporary but indefinite halt on new oil and gas leases on federal land. But existing leases still need frequent approvals for operations, to connect to pipelines for transportation, begin drilling or adjust equipment for safety needs. More: Biden's review of oil and gas leasing moves forward amid concern from New Mexico leaders Under de la Vegas order those decisions were removed from local field offices such as the BLMs Carlsbad Field Office, which was found to be one of the busiest in the nation with thousands of such approvals annually. And while new leases were still blocked, management of active leases was returned to the local office as of March 21  the day after the two-month term of the initial order. The orders sunset was applauded by New Mexicos Democrat U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujan who previously urged the Biden administration to not extend the order for fear it could be detrimental to the states economy. More: New Mexico oil and gas emissions grew in 2020, study says, while spills declined New Mexico ranks third in the nation for oil production and ninth in natural gas, while oil and gas provides about a third of the states budget each year with more than half of such operations occurring on federal land. Industry and political leaders argued since Biden took office that his federal actions related to fossil fuel extraction could impact New Mexico more than any other state. In a joint statement, Heinrich and Lujan commended the Interior Department for ending the suspension of the BLMs authority, contending New Mexicos leaders were committed to working with the Biden administration to address pollution and climate change while continuing to produce fossil fuels. More: New Mexico bill to diversify economy beyond oil and gas gains steam in State House While a temporary review period at the beginning of the new administration is reasonable, extending the review period could have led to unnecessary delays that would have a negative impact on New Mexicos economy, the senators wrote. We will continue to work with our colleagues in Congress and the entire Biden administration to ensure that energy states like ours are able to make a smooth transition to a diversified economy based on clean energy and a carbon-free future. Rural communities such as Carlsbad, situated in the Permian Basin oilfield in southeast New Mexico and West Texas, could be especially harmed by such federal actions, the senators wrote, as operators could leave the state and layoff local workers while cutting revenue to regions that host oil and gas developments. More: Lujan Grisham joins state leaders voicing concerns for Biden's halt on oil and gas leases Oil and gas workers and the communities they live in have helped build our nation for more than a century, and revenues from mineral production have supported New Mexicos educational system and state budget, wrote the senators. It is morally imperative that we dont leave these workers and their communities behind as we tackle the climate crisis with the urgency it requires. New Mexico leaders wary of continued oil and gas leasing halt Heinrich and Lujan also called on the President and his administration to end the halt on new federal oil and gas leases. More: The Interior Department reported oil and gas companies hold 13.9 million leased but unused onshore acres of federal land  53 percent of the 26 million total acres set aside for oil and gas production. On and offshore the Department reported oil and gas companies hold 7,700 approved but inactive drilling permits. New Mexicos State energy regulators asserted the impact of the halt on new leases would likely not be felt for about two years, but in the long-term such a ban could bring significant funding shortages to the state as companies would be unable to lease new land. More: Ozone problems continue to plague New Mexico. Enviros seek federal action, blame oil and gas The Department announced it was moving forward with a review of its federal leasing program, scheduling a townhall meeting on March 25 to solicit feedback from stakeholders during the leasing pause. Though a short-term pause is fully appropriate in the new Biden administration, an extended and indefinite suspension would have significant impacts on our workforce and state funding for education and creates unnecessary uncertainty for New Mexicos state and local tax revenues, Heinrich and Lujan said. We oppose an indefinite federal ban on oil and gas leasing, and we urge the administration to complete its review and resume responsible leasing as soon as possible. More: Energy secretary called on to consider impact on New Mexico, oil and gas of federal policy New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also warned the Biden administration of the dire impact the leasing halt could have in disrupting one of New Mexicos major economic drivers.

276,Energy companies have left Colorado with billions of dollars in oil and gas cleanup  Sterling Journal-Advocate,journal-advocate,"Mar 16, 2021",2021-03-16 19:48:42,"When an oil or gas well reaches the end of its lifespan, it must be plugged. If it isnt, the well might leak toxic chemicals into groundwater and spew methane, carbon dioxide and other pollutants  Source: Carbon Tracker Initiative Data visualization: Luna Anna Archey/High Country News **Data not collected for Texas clean up funds. By Nick Bowlin| High Country News March 16, 2021 at 1:48 p.m. When an oil or gas well reaches the end of its lifespan, it must be plugged. If it isnt, the well might leak toxic chemicals into groundwater and spew methane, carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere for years on end. But plugging a well is no simple task: Cement must be pumped down into it to block the opening, and the tubes connecting it to tanks or pipelines must be removed, along with all the other onsite equipment. Then the top of the well has to be chopped off near the surface and plugged again, and the area around the rig must be cleaned up. There are nearly 60,000 unplugged wells in Colorado in need of this treatment  each costing $140,000 on average, according to the Carbon Tracker, a climate think tank, in a new report that analyzes oil and gas permitting data. Plugging this many wells will cost a lot more than $8 billion, the report found. Companies that drill wells in Colorado are legally required to pay for plugging them. They do so in the form of bonds, which the state can call on to pay for the plugging. But as it stands today, Colorado has only about $185 million from industry  just 2% of the estimated cleanup bill, according to the new study. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) assumes a cost of $82,500 per each well  lower than the Carbon Trackers figure, which factors in issues like well depth. But even using the states more conservative number, the overall cleanup would cost nearly $5 billion, of which the money currently available from energy companies would cover less than 5%. This is the product of more than 150 years of energy extraction. Now, with the oil and gas industry looking less robust every year and reeling in the wake of the pandemic, the state of Colorado and its people could be on the hook for billions in cleanup costs. Meanwhile, unplugged wells persist as environmental hazards. This spring, Colorado will tackle the problem; state energy regulators have been tasked with reforming the policies governing well cleanup and financial commitments from industry. The system has put the state at risk, and it needs to change, said Josh Joswick, an organizer with the environmental group Earthworks. Now we have a government that wants to do something about it. *** The first Western oil well broke ground in Colorado in 1860. Drilling has been an important part of the states economy ever since; as of 2019, Colorado ranked in the sixth and seventh in the nation for oil and natural gas production, respectively. When it comes to cleanup, Colorado uses a tiered system known as blanket bonding. Small operators can pay ahead on single wells. Drillers with more than 100 wells statewide pay a fixed reclamation fee of $100,000, regardless of the number of wells. A similar system also applies to wells on federal public land in the state. Large companies pay a single $150,000 bond, which covers unlimited federal public land wells throughout the country. There are about 7,400 public-land wells capable of producing oil or gas in Colorado, according to the Bureau of Land Management. When a driller walks away or cannot pay for cleanup, the well enters the states Orphan Well Program, which works to identify and plug these wells. There are about 200 wells in the program right now, according to the state. But a closer look at state data reveals a large number of wells at risk. Nearly half of the states unplugged wells are stripper wells low-producing operations with small profit margins often at the end of their lifespans. These wells are particularly vulnerable to shifts in oil prices. That means they change hands often. This is a common tactic in the oil and gas industry: Spinning off liabilities to progressively weaker companies, until the final owner goes bankrupt and none of the previous owners are on the hook for cleanup, said Clark Williams-Derry, a finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. There are also inactive wells: Nearly 10% of the states wells have not produced oil or gas in at least two years, according to a Carbon Tracker analysis of state permitting data. Unlike some of the neighboring oil states, Colorado requires that companies pay a single bond on each inactive well of this sort. This costs either $10,000 or $20,000, depending on the depth of the well. In theory, these payments protect the state, in case the well owner goes bankrupt. But in Colorado, its still far cheaper for energy companies to pay the cost of that single, unused well  and the small annual premium payments on the bond  than to actually plug it. Colorado clearly makes it cheaper to idle a well than to clean it up, Williams-Derry said. In Colorado, just two companies are responsible for nearly 70% of the bonds for currently inactive wells. One is Noble Energy Inc., which was purchased by the global oil giant Chevron in October 2020. The other is Kerr-McGee, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. Kerr-McGee was responsible for the 2017 home explosion in Firestone, Colorado, that killed two people. Last year, the COGCC fined the company more than $18 million for the accident, by far the largest fine in state history. Both companies still own large numbers of wells in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, the prolific oil and gas formation beneath central and eastern Colorado. And the mass desertion of wells is not hypothetical: In fall of 2019, a small company called Petroshare Corporation went bankrupt and left about 90 wells for the state to cleanup. That alone will cost Colorado millions of dollars. Last summer, when Californias largest oil driller filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, it left billions in debt and more than17,000 unplugged wells. The oil and gas industry is already mired in a years-long decline that raises doubts about its ability to meet cleanup costs. In six out of the past seven years, energy has been either the worst- or second-worst-performing sector on the S&P 500. And the economic fallout from COVID-19 has only accelerated the decline. Oil prices hit record lows in 2020. The industrys debt approached record levels, and thousands of oilfield workers lost their jobs, Colorado Public Radio reported. Many companies went bankrupt, including 12 drilling companies and six oilfield service companies in Colorado, according to Haynes and Boone LLP, a law firm that tracks industry trends. *** In 2019, a new law completely overhauled the states relationship to oil and gas. This spring, Colorado oil and gas regulators are tasked with reforming the financial requirements for well plugging. Its a big deal, especially in an oil state like Colorado: The law gives local governments more control over oil and gas development, and it rewrote the mission of the COGCC, the states energy regulator. The COGCC has subsequently banned",https://www.journal-advocate.com/2021/03/16/energy-companies-have-left-colorado-with-billions-of-dollars-in-oil-and-gas-cleanup/

Save North Dakota is gearing up to fight for its oil and gas industry, which faces significant headwinds at the federal level. Those headwinds are readily apparent in recent decisions that range from killing Keystone XLs border crossing permit to ordering more environmental study for Dakota Access. More recently, the Biden administration announced a suspension of oil and gas leasing on federal lands, for policy review  one that will seek to align the federal government with the Democratic partys' climate change agenda. Our administration is making North Dakotas case known to the powers that be in Washington, Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford said in a media conference Tuesday, March 16 to unveil two studies to help the state make that case. Thats is why its so important to educate both the public and policy makers on the tremendous impact the oil and gas industry has on North Dakotas economy, on our workforce and our communities. One study was prepared by NDSUs Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics and the other is by Brent Bogar, formerly with Jadestone Consulting and now a senior consultant for AE2S. This is a very critical time for the industry, and, in turn, for our states overall economic health, Sanford said. As the forces of COVID that drove oil prices into negative territory begin to wane, life is finally beginning to return to normal, and oil prices rebound. And there are new forces, at the same time, working against the oil and gas industry. Seventeen counties in North Dakota are producing oil and gas. That's a fraction of the state's total, 53 counties, but the industry focused there is a statewide economic powerhouse, driving $40 billion in gross business volume for 2019 alone, as well as generating $3.8 billion in tax revenues from the gross production and extraction taxes, which are distributed statewide through various funding formulas or ""buckets."" Even during the pandemic, which crushed oil demand worldwide amid an international price war and caused the loss of thousands of energy jobs in the state, NDSU researchers Dean Bangsund and Nancy Hodur still found ""out-sized"" economic impact from the industry. And, despite the pandemic, the industry still generated just over $2 billion in tax revenues from gross production and extraction taxes. That was a drop from 2019 of almost $500 million  but still exceeded annual funds generated in the 2015-17 downturn. It suggests North Dakota's oil and gas industry is maturing, and offering a larger number of more stable jobs, Bangsund said. Where drilling used to account for the bulk of oil and gas jobs, there are now more jobs in things like transportation and processing. The industry has also gotten better, both technologically and logistically. What we've learned over the last decade is that the North Dakota oil and natural gas industry is incredibly resilient, he added. Regardless of market conditions, it continues to be a major force in our state's economy. Tax revenues from 2008 to 2020, meanwhile, totaled around $22 billion, according to a study prepared by Bogar for both the Western Dakota Energy Association and the North Dakota Petroleum Council. Every county in North Dakota continues to receive revenue derived from the states oil and natural gas production and extraction taxes, Bogar said. From the $8 billion Legacy Fund to K-12 education and infrastructure funding, the industrys impact will be felt across North Dakota for generations to come. The expenditures ranged from $1.5 billion for education to $1.2 billion for water projects, among many others, Bogar said. In all, tax revenues supported $8.2 billion in spending for infrastructure in local communities, as well as $440 million for statewide property tax relief for the study period. Cass County received the most funding from the various oil and gas tax distributions, according to Bogars analysis. That's a key finding, Sanford said. (The oil and natural gas industry) truly has statewide impact, he said. It should be considered as a statewide industry in our policy making and our budgeting decisions.",https://www.willistonherald.com/news/oil_and_energy/north-dakota-gears-up-to-help-fight-for-multibillion-dollar-oil-and-gas-industry/article_64646ad0-867e-11eb-9f0b-aff1a4f55ead.html

View Comments A major oil and gas producer in the Permian Basin withdrew its application for a permit to construct and operate a natural gas facility in Eddy County, citing future infrastructure plans in the area. XTO Energy, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil withdrew the permit application in an Aug. 31 letter to the New Mexico Environment Department. The air quality permit application was filed by the company on Oct. 24, 2019 and was received by NMED five days later, records show. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. The application was for two facilities known as the Husky Gas Plant and Central Delivery Point planned to operate in Eddy County about 14 miles northeast of Loving, which would have had capacity to process about 200,000 barrels per day of oil stabilization, along with natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL). NMED records show the facility was expected to emit on a daily basis about 257 tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 226 tons of carbon monoxide, 742 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 182 tons of particulate matter. Overall, the facility was also expected to emit about 2.7 million tons per day of greenhouse gas. More: New Mexico finalizes oil and gas wastewater regulations, lawmakers hear testimony Records show NMED found the expected emissions would not exceed air quality standards, and on Aug. 4 announced its intent to approve the permit by Sept. 7. In the letter withdrawing the permit, Ethan Boor, an environmental engineer with XTO Energy said the permit was to be withdrawn in response to future infrastructure development plans in Eddy County. XTO did not respond to request for additional comments from the Current-Argus regarding the reason for the withdrawal. More: Southeast New Mexico economy struggles during COVID-19, declines in oil and gas In the letter, Boor wrote that the Delaware Basin, an oil-rich western section of the greater Permian Basin which straddles the New Mexico-Texas state line, remained an important area for XTOs ongoing fossil fuel development operations. He noted the company recently began operations at its Cowboy Central Delivery Point, a natural gas processing plant in Lea County about 18 miles southeast of Loving and will continue to use existing infrastructure to develop in the Permian with a smaller environmental footprint. The Delaware Basin remains a key component of XTOs future growth and the current decision has no impact on the existing operations in New Mexico, Boor wrote. XTO recently started up the Cowboy Central Delivery Pint and will leverage this facility and other infrastructure to continue to efficiently develop the Permian Basin with a smaller physical and environmental footprint. More: New Mexico oil and gas rig counts continue drop; industry to see gradual recovery in 2020 Jeremy Nichols, climate and energy program director at Santa Fe-based environmental group WildEarth Guardians said the organization opposed the project from its start, citing its impact on air quality if the plant was built and operated. He said that while NMED at the XTO did not acknowledge the reason for the withdrawal of the permit, Nichols suspected air quality concerns raised by WildEarth Guardians likely played a role in the decision. ""While NMED's response to our comments only says that XTO withdrew its application, it seems pretty clear that air quality concerns factored into the company's decision, Nichols said. This gas plant was set to be a major installation and it seems like XTO has already invested considerably in its planning.  At the end of the day, this probably reflects the fact that XTO saw this as a losing investment, both from an economic and environmental standpoint. Whatever the reason, this is great news for clean air and health in southeast New Mexico and it underscores the headwinds facing industry as they own up to their true environmental liabilities. More: Sale of New Mexico public land to oil and gas nets $8M, despite opposition during Covid-19 In comments submitted by WildEarth Guardians in January 2019 to NMED, the group pointed to the region of the proposed plant in southeast New Mexico as one known to exceed allowable ozone levels prescribed in the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The NAAQS maximum set in 2015, is 70 parts per billion (ppb) of ozone, and New Mexicos statutes require action if any area records 95 percent of the standard or 67 ppb taken as a three-year average. Ozone, an air pollutant known to cause asthma and other respiratory problems, is created when NOx or VOCs interact with sunlight at the ground level. More: New Mexico oil and gas advocates criticize Democrat presidential ticket's fracking stance Exceeding the federal standard could trigger stricter restrictions from the Environmental Protection Agency and increase requirements for future permitting and operations in the area. State records show that between 2017 and 2019 Carlsbad in Eddy County had an average of 79 ppb of ozone, while Hobbs in neighboring Lea County also known for heavy oil and gas operations posted an average of 71 ppb.

The confirmation drew differing reactions from the New Mexicos activist community championing the first Native American appointed to the seat as a defender of environmental concerns, and the oil and gas industry which worried her record of radical stances on fossil fuels could imperil the states economy. More than half of New Mexicos oil and gas production is on federal land subject to policies enacted at the Department of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management which Haaland will lead as a cabinet secretary. More: 'Radical' or bipartisan? Haaland's Interior Secretary hearing a debate on oil and gas Meanwhile, the state depends on fossil fuel development for about a third of its budget on average each year. Haalands confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which voted 11-9 to send the nomination to the Senate Floor for the final vote, was testy at times as Republican members grilled the congresswoman on her stances on oil and gas, extraction and the environment. The nominee repeatedly deflected questions about her own stances, as Republicans pointed to her past support of the Green New Deal and a ban on hydraulic fracturing, contending she would follow the agenda of President Joe Biden, not her own. More: Key energy takeaways from Deb Haaland's confirmation hearing for Interior Secretary Political leaders, industry hope for collaboration with Haaland Ryan Flynn, president of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association said upon her confirmation that Haalands performance in the hearing was encouraging and he hoped the industry would continue its close work with federal regulators under the incoming administration. He said oil and gas was essential to New Mexicos economy, providing billions of dollars for public education and infrastructure and that the industry was committed to addressing pollution and climate change under Haalands leadership. The secretary set an encouraging tone of collaboration and partnership in her confirmation hearings, promising to work with all stakeholders to develop and safeguard Americas vast natural resources, Flynn said. We are eager to do our part to proactively combat climate change and ensure our state and nation continues to be a leader in the safe, responsible production of oil and natural gas. More: New Mexico oil and gas industry, environmentalists divided on Haaland nomination Democrat political leaders in New Mexico congratulated Haaland as New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham hoped she could undue the energy policies of former-President Donald Trump who pursued an American energy dominance agenda during his term and sought to open more land to oil and gas while rolling back key environmental regulations. Lujan Grisham said she also looked forward to Haalands ability, as a 35th-generation New Mexican and member of the Laguna Pueblo, to address the needs and concerns of Native Americans and Tribal Nations. Her leadership at Interior will not only help reverse the harmful policies of the last four years but chart a new, balanced and productive course for the future, Lujan Grisham said. I greatly look forward to working with the secretary on the issues that matter to tribes and pueblos and to all New Mexicans. More: Biden's review of oil and gas leasing moves forward amid concern from New Mexico leaders U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) who voted in support of Haalands nomination said the secretary was an ideal choice as one who would work closely with western states to diversify economies and protect natural resources. She will be a true partner for Western states like New Mexico as we diversify our economy, invest in our communities, and remain a global leader in producing and exporting energy, Heinrich said. Environmentalists, oil and gas advocates clash on Haalands energy policy Larry Behrens, Santa Fe-based western states director with Power the Future  a group that advocates for the oil and gas industry  worried that Bidens agenda, which Haaland pledged to follow, was already harming New Mexico. More: New Mexico oil and gas emissions grew in 2020, study says, while spills declined He pointed to an indefinite pause on new oil and gas leases on federal land enacted by Biden via executive order upon taking office as a sign that the new federal administration intended to slow fossil fuel development to the detriment of New Mexicos bottom line. Deb Haaland has said she will simply follow President Bidens orders, sadly those orders are already killing jobs in Haalands own state, Behrens said. During her confirmation hearing, Deb Haaland made a commitment to listen to Americas energy workers, now we will see if she was telling the truth. Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance said Haaland was Bidens most extreme cabinet nominee and would likely lead federal policy that will raise the cost of energy and drive oil and gas companies away from the U.S. Any senator who casts a vote in support of Haaland is voting against American energy and will be forced to explain to their own constituents that they are directly responsible for rising energy prices and why foreign nations like China, who controls the rare earth mineral market required for renewable energy manufacturing, is in control of our energy future, not us, Pyle said. More: New Mexico bill to diversify economy beyond oil and gas gains steam in State House By contrast, environmentalists applauded Haalands stances on conservation and energy arguing she would take action to address climate change at the helm of the Department of the Interior. New Mexico Wildlife Federation Executive Director Jesse Deubel said he expected Haaland to lead the management of public lands to a more diverse use including outdoor recreation and conservation initiatives. There is a lot of work to do, and a lot of bad policy from the previous administration to undo, Deubel said. The confirmation of Deb Haaland as Interior Secretary represents a huge step forward in common-sense land management and energy policy that will be good for families, sportsmen and sportswomen, our youth, our natural world, and the economy. More: Lujan Grisham joins state leaders voicing concerns for Biden's halt on oil and gas leases Mark Allison, executive director of New Mexico Wilderness Alliance pointed to Haalands work in Congress to prevent oil and gas development in the historic and sacred Chaco Canyon area in northwestern New Mexico while pushing a public lands package that created 13 new protected wilderness areas across the state. As competing climate and mass extinction crises worsen, Secretary Haaland is the perfect choice to safeguard our wild places, Allison said. We know she is the right leader for this critical time, and she will bring the same effec",https://www.currentargus.com/story/news/local/2021/03/16/deb-haaland-lead-interior-new-mexico-oil-and-gas-industry-concerned/4715884001/
281,Will AI Replace People in Oil and Gas? |Rigzone,rigzone,"Mar 16, 2021",2021-03-16 09:45:55,"""Spot"" the robot dog aboard the Skarv FPSO in the North Sea. PHOTO SOURCE: Cognite Tweet ""Spot"" the robot dog aboard the Skarv FPSO in the North Sea. PHOTO SOURCE: Cognite The energy transition and digitalization are common buzzwords in the oil and gas industry. According to the head of an industrial data software firm, the former will rely on the latter. Digitalization will be the backbone of the energy transition, said John Markus Lervik, CEO and co-founder of Cognite. Instant access to trustworthy contextualized data for better business decisions will transform the industry. Those who invest in their digital agendas and focus on scalability and democratized user enablement will continue to lead the way and increase sustainability, safety, effectiveness, and profitability in the process. The oil and gas industrys tribulations from the past year have also given it more clarity regarding how to embrace digitalization, said Lervik. Read on for his insights on how the industrys focus on digitalization has changed  including his answer to the question in the title about artificial intelligence (AI)  and related trends in the digital evolution of oil and gas operations. Rigzone: Looking back to early 2020 versus now, how has the oil and gas industrys interest level in remote operations changed? John Markus Lervik: The pandemic has really applied a stress test on digitalization investments and very quickly revealed which investments were valuable and future-proof. A lot of industrial companies we work with experienced challenges of their teams having limited access to industrial sites, having to cut budgets while increasing ROI (return on investment) from digital investments, and of course turbulence related to uncertainty in the market. However, weve seen the frontrunners invest in digital strategies that focus on scalability and end-user enablement  whether its for the engineers, the data scientists, or the domain experts in the field. The ability to quickly scale solutions across industrial assets is a competitive advantage. One of Cognites clients, which operates 30 oil platforms with more than 300 wells, lacked a unified overview of maintenance activities and the ability to communicate them effectively to workers. In a matter of a couple of months, we helped them develop and deploy a maintenance planner application powered by contextualized data from our industrial data platform, Cognite Data Fusion to optimize efficiency and reduce waste by enabling efficient scoping, planning and execution of maintenance work. The application leverages contextualized data from different source systems to display a list of work orders prioritized by risk factors and maps them to a 3D model of the platform. This solution has been readily scaled from one platform to 21 platforms, helping the client to reduce planned shutdowns by close to 30%, boosting production by approximately 700,000 barrels a year. These efficiency gains are valued at $38 million a year. Another focus area is investing in technology, which enables end-users to make better data-driven decisions by exposing them to the contextualized data in the format they understand. Our belief at Cognite is that technology is there to abstract complexity and democratize access to data. An example of a company that has really embraced this is OMV (OTCMKTS: OMVKY) as they are focusing on live operational digital twins to power remote operations. Rigzone: Which segments of the industry have been most active in integrating AI, and what have they observed by doing so? Lervik: First, it is key to understand that without access to contextualized, governed data, AI in the industry is at best just a nice theory. As explained later, industrial AI indeed has a lot of potential, but one needs to make sure one has a robust data architecture, which contextualizes data from the common siloed data systems, and makes this data available with sufficient quality and performance. As for practical uses of AI, there are two areas I can highlight that have had the most impactful results, and one emerging area that I believe will deliver a lot of impact going forward. The first one is predictive maintenance. A number of our clients have been leveraging Cognite Data Fusion to enable solutions for predictive maintenance by contextualizing vast amounts of historical and real-time data, analyzing it, and applying AI to predict where the next downtime is most likely to happen and enabling the companies to plan their maintenance much more proactively and actually allocate time to attend to the most critical tasks first. The second one is production optimization. There the power lies in what we call hybrid AI which is really merging physics-based modeling with AI to forecast and optimize production. OMV is an example of one of the leaders in the field. They use Cognites application called BestDay. BestDay uses data-driven AI modeling to calculate what its name suggests: the best possible production day. BestDay evaluates a fields production history, custom boundary conditions, and production criteria to produce a maximum capacity algorithm that updates daily. This creates real-time organizational visibility on all aspects of production, enabling experts to reduce unplanned deferment events and increase overall production throughput. One of the emerging AI applications with the most impact is within the robotics field where you can incorporate data (visual and sound)  for instance, collected by robots or drones  into continuously enriched digital twins and then use this to analyze asset performance. Then you can start to automate some of these missions using Cognite Data Fusion. You may have seen that we recently deployed Spot the robot dog on his first autonomous missionoffshore aboard the Skarv in the North Sea with Aker BP (FRA: ARC). Rigzone: Which types of operations are best suited for robots and other AI technologies? Lervik: Everything that happens in the industry can be optimized by data. The next big space with a lot of potential is using data to make operations more sustainable by attacking areas like fuel consumption, chemical use, and others. Here data can be leveraged to directly decrease the environmental footprint of the operations while at the same time maintaining and often increasing profitability. Cognite is currently working with the Center for 4th Industrial Revolution for the Oceans, which is established by Aker and the World Economic Forum, together with industrial partners such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Here, we develop a next-generation Discharge and Emissions Tracker, where the objective is to build a digital application that will optimize, track, and eventually develop better and more efficient practices for oil and gas chemical consumption and discharge. The tracker is a joint effort between the Center and project partners, including Cognite, and the E&P company Aker BP. Aker BP provides the tracker with real-time data and operational expertise from its offshore facilities, while Cognite is responsible for the software solutions.

282,"In Colorado, the Looming Liability of Oil and Gas Cleanup",undark,"Mar 16, 2021",2021-03-16 09:08:21,"After collecting only a fraction of the funds needed from companies, the state is reforming financial requirements. W hen an oil or gas well reaches the end of its lifespan, it must be plugged. If it isnt, the well might leak toxic chemicals into groundwater and spew methane, carbon dioxide, and other pollutants into the atmosphere for years on end. But plugging a well is no simple task: Cement must be pumped down into it to block the opening, and the tubes connecting it to tanks or pipelines must be removed, along with all the other onsite equipment. Then the top of the well has to be chopped off near the surface and plugged again, and the area around the rig must be cleaned up. This story was originally published by High Country Newsand is reproduced here as part of the Climate Deskcollaboration. There are nearly 60,000 unplugged wells in Colorado in need of this treatment  each costing $140,000 on average, according to the Carbon Tracker, a climate think tank, in a new report that analyzes oil and gas permitting data. Plugging this many wells will cost a lot  more than $8 billion, the report found. Companies that drill wells in Colorado are legally required to pay for plugging them. They do so in the form of bonds, which the state can call on to pay for the plugging. But as it stands today, Colorado has only about $185 million from industry  just 2 percent of the estimated cleanup bill, according to the new study. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) assumes an average cost of $82,500 per well  lower than the Carbon Trackers figure, which factors in issues like well depth. But even using the states more conservative number, the overall cleanup would cost nearly $5 billion, of which the money currently available from energy companies would cover less than 5 percent. This situation is the product of more than 150 years of energy extraction. Now, with the oil and gas industry looking less robust every year and reeling in the wake of the pandemic, the state of Colorado and its people could be on the hook for billions in cleanup costs. Meanwhile, unplugged wells persist as environmental hazards. This spring, Colorado will try to tackle the problem; state energy regulators have been tasked with reforming the policies governing well cleanup and financial commitments from industry. The system has put the state at risk, and it needs to change, said Josh Joswick, an organizer with the environmental group Earthworks. Now we have a government that wants to do something about it. Related With Industrial Brine Comes a Surfeit of Sinkholes The first western oil well broke ground in Colorado in 1860. Drilling has been an important part of the states economy ever since; as of 2019, Colorado ranked in the sixth and seventh in the nation for oil and natural gas production, respectively. When it comes to cleanup, Colorado uses a tiered system known as blanket bonding. Small operators can pay ahead with bonds on single wells. Drillers with more than 100 wells statewide pay a fixed reclamation fee of $100,000, regardless of the number of wells. A similar system also applies to wells on federal public land in the state. Large companies pay a single $150,000 bond, which covers unlimited federal public land wells throughout the country. There are about 7,400 public-land wells capable of producing oil or gas in Colorado, according to the Bureau of Land Management. When a driller walks away or cannot pay for cleanup, the well enters the states Orphan Well Program, which works to identify and plug these wells. There are about 200 wells in the program right now, according to the state. But a closer look at state data reveals a large number of wells at risk. Nearly half of the states unplugged wells are stripper wells  low-producing operations with small profit margins often at the end of their lifespans. These wells are particularly vulnerable to shifts in oil prices. That means they change hands often. This is a common tactic in the oil and gas industry: Spinning off liabilities to progressively weaker companies, until the final owner goes bankrupt and none of the previous owners are on the hook for cleanup, said Clark Williams-Derry, a finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. There are also inactive wells: Nearly 10 percent of the states wells have not produced oil or gas in at least two years, according to a Carbon Tracker analysis of state permitting data. Unlike some of the neighboring oil states, Colorado requires that companies pay a single bond on each inactive well of this sort. This costs either $10,000 or $20,000, depending on the depth of the well. In theory, these payments protect the state, in case the well owner goes bankrupt. But in Colorado, its still far cheaper for energy companies to pay the cost of that single, unused well  and the small annual premium payments on the bond  than to actually plug it. Colorado clearly makes it cheaper to idle a well than to clean it up, Williams-Derry said. In Colorado, just two companies are responsible for nearly 70 percent of the bonds for currently inactive wells. One is Noble Energy Inc., which was purchased by the global oil giant Chevron in October 2020. The other is Kerr-McGee, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. Kerr-McGee was responsible for the 2017 home explosion in Firestone, Colorado, that killed two people. Last year, the COGCC fined the company more than $18 million for the accident, by far the largest fine in state history. Both companies still own large numbers of wells in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, the prolific oil and gas formation beneath central and eastern Colorado. And the mass desertion of wells is not hypothetical: In fall of 2019, a small company called Petroshare Corporation went bankrupt and left about 90 wells for the state to cleanup. That alone will cost Colorado millions of dollars. Last summer, when Californias largest oil driller filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, it left billions in debt and more than 17,000 unplugged wells. Data not collected for Texas clean up funds. Source: Carbon Tracker Initiative Data visualization: Luna Anna Archey/High Country News The oil and gas industry is already mired in a years-long decline that raises doubts about its ability to meet cleanup costs. In six out of the past seven years, energy has been either the worst- or second-worst-performing sector on the S&P 500. And the economic fallout from Covid-19 has only accelerated the decline. Oil prices hit record lows in 2020. The industrys debt approached record levels, and thousands of oilfield workers lost their jobs, Colorado Public Radio reported . Many companies went bankrupt, including 12 drilling companies and six oilfield service companies in Colorado, according to Haynes and Boone LLP, a law firm that tracks industry trends. In 2019, a new law completely overhauled the states relationship to oil and gas. This spring, Colorado oil and gas regulators are tasked with reforming the financial requirements for well plugging.

Comments Share: Dublin, March  15, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Reservoir Analysis Market - Forecasts from 2021 to 2026""report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The global reservoir analysis market is evaluated at US$7.737 billion for the year 2020 growing at a CAGR of 4.67% reaching the market size of US$10.174 billion by the year 2026. Reservoir analysis refers to the analysis of the rocks, pores and fluids inside a reservoir to optimise their production and recovery techniques. The methods and equipment used in the analysis develops subsurface data which helps in the analysis of the reservoir in order to increase the reliability of the reservoir. The market is majorly driven by the rapid increase in the complexities of the reservoir due to increasing depth and the also with rising use of horizontal wells as well. The analysis also helps in further developing the dynamic properties of the rock and fluid properties that the reservoir has. A key factor expected to be driving the market during the forecast period is the increase in the demand of oil & gas which are used in various applications across several industries like, automotive, aviation, electricity generation, and others. Moreover, with the given rate of industrialization and technological advancements in the energy sector, the reliability on reservoir analysis has increased in the recent years. Moreover, the analysis gives us the relevant information in several areas like Reservoir Characteristics - Permeability, completion efficiency (skin), formation permeability, etc, if the flowing pressure is known in addition to the flow rate (assuming the existence of BDF), estimate of the recoverable hydrocarbons, and is usually determined by traditional production decline analysis methods, amongst others. Furthermore, the rising focus on mature oil & gas fields and other field developments are expected to fuel the market during the forecast period. The market is expected to witness a significant growth owing to the innovation in the techniques used to do the analysis required. For instance, with the introduction of Rate-transient Analysis (RTA) which is said to be an extension to the Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA), allows the operator to analyse the data without shutting down the operations of the well which prevents the losses in production. The RTA technique basically combines Darcy's law with EoS and MBE to obtain a PDE, which is then solved analytically. The market of the reservoir analysis will be majorly fuelled by the rising demand of energy resources at a global level. This has led to an increased productivity of most of the energy resources in the recent years. For instance, According to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global production of the natural gas reached the highest production done ever in the year 2019 with 4 088 Bcm produced which is +3.33% as compared to that in the year 2018. According to the report, the production of the natural gas has witnessed a steady increase since the financial crisis at compounded annual growth rate of 2.7%. The advent of COVID-19 had an adverse impact on the global Reservoir analysis market since the pandemic brought the activities in refinery industry to a standstill globally which restricted the project construction, exploration and production activities. After the initial lockdown period, some of the activities were allowed but with restrictions and certain protocols that were required to be followed like the refinery will be operated with lesser capacity which will require less labour to come in contact and social distancing was required to be maintained in the premises as well. Moreover, the sales in the industry dipped during the initial months of the year owing to the lockdown which led to the shutting down of the sellers for a certain period initially. Countries across the globe which are one of the biggest consumers of oil, gas and petroleum related products were under lockdown in the year which led to a decline in the prices of oil globally. With the industries recovering after the pandemic gradually, the oil & gas business is expected to operate in full capacity starting from the third and fourth quarters of 2020. This will further help in the recovery of the reservoir analysis market during the forecast period. The segmentation of the global Reservoir analysis market has been done into application, reservoir type, service and geography. By application, the classification of the market has been done into Onshore and Offshore. By reservoir type, the classification of the market has been done into Conventional and Unconventional. By service, the classification of the market has been done into Geo Modelling, and Reservoir Simulation, Data Acquisition and Monitoring, Reservoir Sampling, and Others. Furthermore, on the basis of geography, the global market has been distributed as North America, South America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and the Asia Pacific. Increasing investments in the oil & gas sector will drive the market during the forecast period The growth of the Reservoir analysis market is fuelled by the increasing investments being done in the oil & gas sector. The main aim of the investments are to urbanize and digitalise the sector in order to increase productivity by making the production plants more efficient, in order to meet the surging demands of the energy sources globally. Various initiatives across several countries have fuelled the investments in the sector over the years and is expected to continue the trend during the forecast period as well. According to a report on global investments in the sector by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the investments in nominal terms in the sector have witnessed a significant rise over the years from US$ 434 Billion in the year 2016 to US$ 483 Billion in 2019. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic in the year adversely effected the planned investments that were to be done in the sector during the year 2020, the amount of planned investments is expected to recover during the year 2020 owing to the upcoming oil & gas projects and other similar projects that were suspended due to the pandemic. Thus, the upcoming and ongoing investments is expected to drive the market during the forecast period, as technology innovations in the sector will increase the adoption of the reservoir analysis technology in the sector. A substantial shift towards developing unconventional reserves will be a tailwind to the growth The rise in the development of unconventional reserves is expected to fuel the growth of the market of reservoir analysis during the forecast period. The shift is due to the rising concern at a global level about the increasing rate of depletion of conventional sources of energy this has led to a noticeable decline in the production levels of oil & gas. The concern has led to the tapping of energy potential from solid rocks. The shift has been fuelled by the increasing government relaxations across sever",http://feeds.benzinga.com/~r/benzinga/analyst-ratings/~3/EvFneq3CaO4/worldwide-reservoir-analysis-industry-to-2026-increasing-investments-in-the-oil-gas-sector-will-dr

Well-funded anti-oil and gas campaigners are using the old magicians trick of look over there so you dont notice whats going on over here. For some time we have seen sensational claims the oil and gas industry is receiving billions in subsidies and the campaigns to end them. Its just the oil and gas industry isnt getting these subsidies and so their campaigns to end them succeeded before they started. What they are successfully distracting from are the billions in real subsidies for green energy, ironically funded in part with tax revenues from the oil and gas industry. This magic trick of starting petitions to end nonexistent subsidies depended on using a special definition of subsidies. So they note that things like the discounted price of gasoline in Saudi Arabia increases international demand and thus is a subsidy to the global oil and gas industry. Or they find an economist to say the normal royalties on oil and gas should be higher and so the actual rate is a subsidy. In ENGO magic tricks, when you pay cash royalties you are actually receiving government subsidies. Another one of their favourites is to say LNG equipment should be depreciated slowly and so the Government is giving oil and gas companies another subsidy. Thats right when an LNG business pays cash for equipment and puts the expense on their tax return its not investing in infrastructure and the economy, its a Government subsidy. The list goes on but you can perhaps forgive the confused Chief Financial Officers of oil and gas companies searching with google for where they can apply for the billions in subsidies and finding none. On the other hand, try googling green energy grants and think how long it would take to go through the 260 million results. When it comes to windmills, solar, biofuel, hydrogen, batteries, fuel cells, electric cars we are talking billions and billions of subsidies. You know the kind where the Government sends you money, not the other way around. The same google search for oil and gas grants turns up only millions. But thats how magic works, no one notices how the billions disappeared if you are looking over there at a few million. Though recently ENGOs turned up a real subsidy. During the double whammy of COVID-19 restrictions making it difficult to work and the worldwide complete collapse in oil prices, the industry asked for liquidity support. The Government did in fact put a record number of billions into liquidity support to among other things support the bond market in many companies. The Government did announce several programs to help the oil industry too, but when you tried to access these programs you were told to call your bank or put them on hold while they considered it. The only meaningful support that came through was a $1.9 billion commitment to help abandon wells. Here are the problems with that support: It is being released over time and so almost none of it reached companies while they struggled with a liquidity crisis A lot goes to orphan wells and so this only covers liabilities of companies already bankrupt. A subsidy after you go bankrupt is not so useful. You can only access the support for part of the cost of abandoning wells if you spend money for the other part. If you need liquidity support because you dont have liquidity then you cant access the subsidy. When the Government is literally spending hundreds of billions giving $1.9 billion to the countrys largest industry is a drop in the bucket. So the ENGOs finally found their actual subsidy for oil and gas. A drip going mostly to big foreign oil companies with the money to take advantage of it, while an ocean of COVID-19 dollars floods the markets. Without a doubt, the central theme of this Government is cash subsidies for their much-ballyhooed green recovery. Here are a couple of examples. A policy brief from the International Institute for Sustainable Development notes that Canada announced almost $15 billion in financial support for green initiatives in 2020. That is almost 800% more than the support announced for the much larger oil and gas industry during COVID-19. Perhaps the biggest Canadian example of green subsidies comes from the disastrous Green Energy Act in Ontario. According to the Auditor General of Ontario , from 2006 to 2014, Ontarians unwittingly subsidized their green energy plan to the tune of $37 billion from the Global Adjustment fees on their power bills.

Washington DC [US]: A new study, led by scientists at the University of Miami(UM) Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, provides new details on the fate of spilled oiland the effectiveness of its chemical dispersants in the marine environment. The findings demonstrates that under realistic environmental conditions, oil drifting in the oceanafter the DWH oil spillphoto-oxidised into persistent compounds within hours to days, instead over long periods of time as was thought during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This is the first model result to support the new paradigm of photooxidation that emerged from laboratory research. After an oil spill, oil droplets on the ocean surface can be transformed by a weathering processknown as photooxidation, which results in the degradation of crude oil from exposure to lightand oxygen into new by-products over time. Tar , a by-product of this weathering process, can remain in coastal areas for decades after a spill. Despite the significant consequences of this weathering pathway, photooxidation was not taken into account in oil spill models or the oil budget calculations during the Deepwater Horizon spill. The UM Rosenstiel School research team developed the first oil-spill model algorithm that tracks the dose of solar radiation oil droplets receive as they rise from the deep sea and are transported at the ocean surface. The authors found that the weathering of oil droplets by solar light occurred within hours to days, and that roughly 75 per cent of the photooxidation during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred on the same areas where chemical dispersants were sprayed from aircraft. Photooxidized oil is known to reduce the effectiveness of aerial dispersants. ""Understanding the timing and location of this weathering process is highly consequential,"" said Claire Paris, a UM Rosenstiel School faculty and senior author of the study. ""It helps directing efforts and resources on fresh oil while avoiding stressing the environment with chemical dispersants on oil that cannot be dispersed."" ""Photooxidized compounds like tar persist longer in the environment, so modeling the likelihood of photooxidation is critically important not only for guiding first response decisions during an oil spill and restoration efforts afterwards, but it also needs to be taken into account on risk assessments before exploration activities"" added Ana Carolina Vaz, assistant scientist at UM's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies and lead author of the study.

Oil & Gas Oil on the boil: Can crude prices sustain at higher levels? Oil prices should remain stable in the range of $55-65 per barrel wherein it will be a balancing act for both the producers as well as consumers of oil. ET CONTRIBUTORS March 15, 2021, 15:16 IST Brent and WTI prices have been rocketing in recent weeks and this has attracted a lot of attention from investors globally. Price rise of more than 75 per cent since November 2020 has been on account of major economies reopening and vaccinating their populations after the pandemic shut down factories and grounded planes in March 2020. This has been a boon for exporters of oil and this flood of cash is a relief for energy behemoths like Saudi Arabiaand Russia, two of the top producers in the global energy market. Although the rising oil pricesare boon for exporters, the importing countries are feeling the heat with growth still lagging when compared to the pre-pandemic era and high oil prices are pinching the end consumers in the form of higher inflation. Demand optimism boils oil The recent meeting of OPEC producersheld on 4 March 2021 opted to increase the production by a meagre 1,50,000 bpd in April instead of market expectations of 1.5 million barrels per day. This clearly signals that the group wants the oil prices to be on the higher side. On the contrary, the demand side boost and optimism is a reason for the strength and the continued momentum in oil prices. Investors have been pumping funds into commodities such as oil on expectations of a demand recovery in the second half of the year as the global economygrows, while a wider rollout of vaccines against the Covid-19 pandemic allows more people to travel this summer. US leads the way in increasing demand According to data from the US Energy Information Administrationreleased on 10 March, the US East Coast crude inventories fell by 478,000 barrels to about 8.4 million barrels, the lowest on record. The East Coast gasoline inventories also fell by about 7.5 million barrels to 63.7 million barrels, the biggest decline since September 2016. Moreover, the overall US gasoline stocks fell by 11.9 million barrels in the week to 231.6 million barrels, compared with expectations for a 3.5 million-barrel drop. The drop in product inventories clearly signals the rising demand from US consumers. Note of caution: Are oil prices sustainable? Although the producers and exporters are a happy lot, the importers are not and hence the recovery in the post-Covid era accompanied by high oil prices is a hindrance for the consumers of oil importing economies. Although the vaccination programmes have started globally, the fresh wave of virus and the increasing infections are leading to restrictions in travel, international and domestic. High oil prices are always detrimental for aviation companies as they form a bigger chunk of the operating costs and the impact becomes more pronounced in a post pandemic world when the demand has not picked up adequately. Higher oil prices have a Passover effect on all the sectors of the economy as all the connected industries right from automobiles to plastics to transportation to agriculture are all dependent on oil. Higher input costs further adds to higher inflationary scenarios in an era of low growth wherein economies are trying to recover from after effects of the pandemic. We are of the view that oil prices should remain stable in the range of $55-65 per barrel wherein it will be a balancing act for both the producers as well as consumers of oil. Taking into consideration the recent gains in oil, and the state of the global economy, higher oil prices will hinder the growth and momentum across. Oil prices cannot sustain at higher prices and we expect correction in (brent and WTI) towards $65/bbl and $60 per barrel respectively. While MCXoil prices have also had the support of the depreciating rupee, prices might move lower towards the Rs 4200/bbl mark in a months time frame.

The newspaper said its source told it that a decision to ban new oil and gas licenses in the UK was close, with the article's authors labeling the potential move as a beginning of the end of the North Sea oil industry, and said the ban would be particularly controversial in Scotland, where almost 40 percent of the UK's total oil and gas workforce is employed. Worth noting, the article says that options considered include a ban on new licenses in 2040, an immediate temporary halt in licensing, but also, it is possible that there wouldn't be any changes. (Read the full article here  registration required). Responding to the article, Oil and Gas UK, a UK-based industry body representing interests of the local offshore oil and gas industry said that any ban as proposed in the article could hinder the UKs ability to deliver a net-zero future, damage, domestic supply chain, increase energy imports and affect local jobs and skills. OGUK Sustainability Director Mike Tholen said:""The UKs offshore oil and gas industry recognizes the urgent need for change and was one of the first sectors to commit to be a net-Zero industry by 2050, setting demanding interim targets to halve its own emissions by 2030. By working together, we can help deliver the energy transition, providing the oil and gas the UK will need for decades to come while cutting the impact on the environment. Any curtailment of activity by licencing constraints risks impeding the UKs ability to deliver a net-zero future, damaging our domestic supply chain and increasing energy imports whilst exporting the jobs and skills. Our industry is leading the way on green technologies including the switch to hydrogen and long-term storage of CO2. Achieving this through UK companies will require significant investment and we continue to work constructively with government to show this industry has the essential expertise and commitment to ensure delivery.""

View Comments As the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) prepares to lease about 6,000 acres of public land to the oil and gas industry for extraction operations next year, public comments on the sale were scheduled to be accepted through next week. The BLM opened public comments on Monday for its January 2021 lease sale and will accept the comments until Sept. 24. The period is intended to solicit feedback from local stakeholders and organizations to inform the final decision making for the parcels to be offered in the sale. Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. The sale was planed for Jan. 14, 2021. As of Wednesday, the sale offered 33 parcels of land totaling in about 6,442 acres in Eddy and Lea County in New Mexico and in Wise County, Texas. Records show about 720 acres or 11 percent of the land offered in the sale was in Eddy County, while 5,223 acres or 81 percent of the land was offered in Lea County. A single, 500-acre parcel was offered in Wise County, Texas  about 8 percent of the sale. More: Permian Basin crude oil pipeline cancelled as market struggles to recover from COVID-19 States that offer public land in the sales receive 48 percent of the sale revenue, with the rest going to the U.S. Treasury, per a BLM news release. The states also receive half the revenue generated when oil and gas is produced on the leased land. The BLM is a key contributor to the Trump Administration's America-First Energy Plan, an all-of-the-above strategy that includes oil and gas, coal, strategic minerals, and renewable sources such as wind, geothermal, and solar  all of which can be produced on public lands, read a statement from the BLM. More: BLM analysis finds no significant impact from oil and gas on public land Through its Environmental Analysis (EA) the BLM reported it found the lease sale would not have a significant impact on air quality and emissions, greenhouse gases, surface and groundwater or threatened species in the area such as the dunes sagebrush lizard or the lesser prairie chicken. The BLM estimated the leases in Eddy and Lea counties would result in 32 horizontal wells and 144 acres of surface disturbance and about 5.4 million barrels of oil produced along with about 31.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The EA noted that extensive oil and gas development already exists in the area contributing to its local economy. More: New Mexico finalizes oil and gas wastewater regulations, lawmakers hear testimony Within these counties, as well as the area immediately surrounding the nominated lease parcels, there already exists extensive oil and gas development and production, read the report. Oil and gas development and its attendant industry are identifying components of the economic and social fabric of the region. While the report noted that the area already exceeded federal ozone standards under the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the analysis argued it was unlikely the wells would be developed concurrently or in the same year and that they would be spread out. More: Oil and gas company opposed to nuke site near Carlsbad excluded from federal proceedings Additionally, emissions would be spread out spatially because the nominated lease parcels would be located in two (Eddy and Lea) counties, read the report. Thus, it is not expected that the Proposed Action would lead directly to additional NAAQS exceedances of O3 in Eddy County. The report also noted that none of the parcels offered contain residences and that nearest residence was about .01 miles from any nominated parcels. Some local pollutant levels see short-term rises, read the report, for about 30 to 60 days. More: New Mexico researchers seek to map Delaware Basin aquifers, inform oil and gas permitting Air quality is dependent on not only the quantity of air pollutants but also environmental conditions (humidity, wind direction and speed, temperature) that influence concentration and dispersion of pollutants, the report read. As for greenhouse gases, estimated operations on the leased land would result in 35,688 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, marking an annual increase of .00055 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions, the report read, and an annual increase of .035 percent of New Mexico oil and gas emissions. The future development was expected to use about 998 acre feet of ground water at about 50 acre feet per year for 20 years, a 0.01 increase of the BLM Pecos Districts 620,416 acre feet of total water use, the report read.

Leasing for oil and gas, and subsequent exploration and development, is a regular and ongoing activity in the region, the report read. In addition, the regulatory program associated with these issues successfully addresses the adverse effects of primary concern and the BLMs authority under standard lease terms and conditions allows the BLM to attach conditions of approval (which typically reduce or eliminate adverse effects on resources) to activities authorized at the time of lease development.

294,Fourteen U.S. states sue Biden administration over oil and gas leasing pause,yahoo,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 16:50:46,"The legal actions, which seek to restore regular federal drilling auctions, came a day before the administration is set to launch a review of the oil and gas... Fr Ihre tgliche Effizienz und Sicherheit | Mehr erfahren National Review The Biden Administration Is Coercing the States. Ohio Is Fighting Back Nudge, but dont push, the Supreme Court tells the federal government about the states. The new Congress this month moved straight to shoving with all its might, and Ohio pushed back last week with a lawsuit that could set an important precedent for federalism. Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 with an eleventh-hour Easter egg, authored by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), that prohibits the states from using any money from the Act to directly or indirectly reduce a states net tax revenue. The federal government is authorized under the Act to claw back money from states that offend this proviso. Now, Ohio does not have any legislative tax cuts in the hopper. (Even supply-siders need to remember that both ends of the Laffer curve have a value of zero: Somewhere along that curve, lower tax rates produce lower tax revenue, and a rate of zero produces zero.) But Schumers Easter egg is a big one and full of surprises. It would affect not only Ohios tax policy but also economic development and job-creation efforts through tax credits and abatements, decisions by the Ohio tax commissioner, and perhaps even enterprise zones. Ohios argument with the federal government is not about cutting taxes; it is about whether the federal government may use its disbursal of funds to dictate state policy  about this or any other subject that is not the province of the federal government under the Constitution. The Supreme Court has held that, when the federal government wants to attach strings to the money it sends back to the states, a few thin strings are okay; coercion is not. So what are a few strings? In the early 1980s, each state set its own drinking age, which varied from 18 to 21. Drunk driving was a major cause of auto accidents and death, and young drivers died more frequently than any others. The federal government wanted a national drinking age but clearly did not have the authority to mandate it. So, reasoned the clever lawyers in D.C., why not simply condition federal highway money on a states raising the age to 21? It was controversial at the time. Politicians called it Little Prohibition and charged that it was federal overreach. President Reagan expressed reservations. But over time, Reagan  ever mindful of practical politics  came around. In 1984, the New York Times noted that in dropping his opposition to the measure, Reagan said he was persuaded by the evidence that raising the drinking age could save lives. In addition, some of Reagans reelection strategists made no secret of their hope that the issue would help the presidents standing among voters. Its a grave national problem, and it touches all our lives, Reagan said as he signed the bill in 1984. With the problem so clear-cut and the proven solution at hand, we have no misgiving about this judicious use of federal power. A lawsuit ensued. The Supreme Court, in South Dakota v. Dole, held that the drinking-age requirement did not offend the Constitution, including the Tenth Amendment, noting that only 5 percent of highway funds would be withheld for noncompliance  a mere inducement, not coercion. During the Obama administration, the federal government threw away the pretense of attaching thin strings and went for the heavy rope. Under the Affordable Care Act, a state that wanted to continue to receive federal funds for the Medicaid program had to dramatically expand Medicaid, which would cost the states billions of dollars. The Supreme Court held in NFIB v. Sebelius, 72, that the mandatory Medicaid expansion of Obamacare was unconstitutionally coercive. The Schumer Easter egg  the federal tax mandate  is the same thing, and its why Ohio went to court. Ohio will receive $5.5 billion under the American Rescue Plan Act, more than 7 percent of the states entire expenditure last year. Critics say, If you dont like it, dont accept the money. But that was the same argument in NFIB  a choice that the Supreme Court likened to a gun to the head. The money to be distributed through the Act is not sitting in a coffee can behind the Treasury secretarys desk. It will be borrowed, and the people of Ohio will be on the hook to repay that money, whether it accepts the money or not. To not accept the money is to accept a penalty of $5.5 billion, plus interest, against the state. This is not the mere inducement to a partnership, as described in South Dakota v. Dole. The tax mandate in the American Rescue Plan Act uses the federal spending power to compel state tax policy, effectively enacting a tax floor though 2024. But state tax policy is inherently a state prerogative. And it is one of the clearest examples of the strengths of federalism: Some states today have low overall burdens and fewer services. Others have higher tax burdens and more services. Some states tax income; others, consumption. People are moving from some of these state laboratories of democracy to others. Federalism is a safeguard against a fatal mistake. When I was a lawyer in private practice, I advised clients to incorporate different business units as separate entities, so that a mistake in one did not sink the entire enterprise. Military commanders compartmentalize information on a need to know basis for the same reason. Federalism limits the bad effects of ill-advised experiments to the states that enact them. Positive results can be and are implemented in other jurisdictions. Federalism protects conservative states against domination by progressive federal governments; it protects progressive states from domination by conservative federal governments. Ohios lawsuit will set a marker on the limits of federal power and protect the safe space in which states may operate. Attorneys general of both parties should support this effort. Were making the argument to protect red and blue states alike. 15h ago",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fourteen-u-states-sue-biden-165046038.html

The gas storage facility was commissioned in 2019. The development of the Companys gas business follows the global trend of using cleaner gas fuel. The implementation of the APG Management Improvement Programme reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves the environmental situation in the producing regions. The APG storage injection technology was implemented for the first time in Eastern Siberia at the Verkhnechonskoye oil and gas condensate field. The unique feature of this technology is the accumulation of associated gas in a temporary underground storage facility for subsequent rational use, rather than for maintaining reservoir pressure. The technology has brought the level of APG utilisation at the Verkhnechonskoye oil and gas condensate field to 97%, which is one of the highest rates in the industry. The associated gas produced together with crude oil at the Verkhnechonskoye field is used for the technological needs of the field--for the operation of a gas turbine power plant and as fuel for oil heating furnaces and boiler houses. As part of the project, a gas compressor station with a capacity of more than 1 bcm per year, a 41 km gas injection pipeline, and six gas injection wells for APG injection were built at the Verkhnechonskoye field. The storage area is 330 km2, or about a quarter of the total area of the field.

This 2019 photo shows oil well storage tanks southeast of Loveland. By Pamela Johnson| johnsonp@reporter-herald.com| Loveland Reporter-Herald PUBLISHED: March 16, 2021 at 2:55 p.m. | UPDATED: March 16, 2021 at 4:12 p.m. Larimer County wont accept applications for oil and gas permits or for 1041 permits for at least 30 days, if not longer. The Larimer County commissioners on Tuesday unanimously approved temporary moratoriums for both types of permits, going into effect immediately and lasting until April 15. Two days before the end, on April 13, the county will hold a public hearing for input on whether to extend or amend the moratoriums. The county is in the midst of reworking both of those sections of the land use code, and Lesli Ellis, community development director, said the moratoriums would prevent potential applicants from rushing to apply before the new, and possibly stricter, rules are implemented. I just feel like its smart to pause and not take applications while were going through this process, said Kristin Stephens, one of three elected county commissioners. She asked residents to weigh in at the 3:30 p.m. hearing April 13 on whether to extend both moratoriums. It does give us an opportunity to work on things and not have to process applications that would be in this gray area between old regulations and new regulations, Stephens said. Oil and gas A previous board of Larimer County commissioners approved the countys first-ever oil and gas regulations last April. Then in November, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission finished creating new state standards for the industry, which are stricter than the county rules. Ellis said the county standards now are out of sync with what was adopted by the state and need to be further aligned and studied. The new board of commissioners  three Democrats who have all said they would like stricter health, safety and environmental regulations  has begun the process with the county staff of reworking the rules with a goal of having the updated regulations on the books by the end of July. Ellis said she anticipates that oil and gas operators could file applications in the county in the interim, creating some urgency for the moratorium to prevent this from happening. The resolution creating that moratorium stressed that it would give county officials time to study the regulations to create what is best for residents and preserve the status quo during that process. The resolution also described the moratorium as necessary for the immediate preservation of public health, welfare or safety of the present and future (residents). Its just the thoughtful and intentional space were creating so we can be very diligent on making these regulations comprehensive, and done well, said Commissioner Jody Shadduck-McNally. While a citizen group that has been advocating for more environmental protections in the oil and gas rules, and asking for the moratorium, lauded the decision, an industry representative was aghast. Tim Gosar, coordinator for the Larimer Alliance, said the moratorium was appropriate and applauded the commissioners for its decision as well as their recent choice to slow down the update process and allow more public comment an to hire an attorney with expertise about oil and gas to help with the rewrite. What youve done is good governance, Gosar said during the public comment portion of the commissioners Tuesday meeting. Its responsive to peoples concerns and needs. I hope at the end, there are great oil and gas regulations that are protective of health, safety and the environment. However, later Tuesday, Lynn Granger, executive director of the American Petroleum Institute, released a statement criticizing the countys move. We are taken aback and gravely concerned with Larimer Countys decision to impose a moratorium on new oil and gas development today, she said in the written statement. The county comprises a significant amount of development in the state, and just last year passed new rules and regulations after appointing a task force and receiving a great deal of community input. The countys unilateral choice to halt new development sends a deeply harmful message to one of the countys most important economic drivers. We hope that commissioners immediately reconsider their unnecessary and rushed decision. 1041 permits Under state laws, counties are able to create regulations that give them a say on certain aspects of projects  that are considered matters of state interest and that they would not normally approve or deny. Just under a decade ago, Larimer County adopted this process, called 1041 powers, for power plants, transmission lines, substations, pipelines and gas storage facilities. High-profile applications filed under this section of the county code include applications for the Thornton Pipeline which was denied and for the Northern Integrated Supply Project which was approved. The county is in the process of updating these rules as part of a land use code overhaul to align with the countys comprehensive plan that addresses public health, safety and welfare, Ellis said. She expects to work on the new standards for eight to 10 months and, as with the oil and gas regulations, believes applications for 1041 permits could be filed in the interim. So, as with the oil and gas regulations, she presented a 30-day moratorium that could be changed or amended at the same April 13 public hearing. All three commissioners supported the pause in 1041 applications to give the county time to study and think through changes to the code.

Biden froze new drilling lease auctions in January as one of his first moves in the White House to pave the way for the review, triggering a backlash from the oil and gas industry which warned it would cost jobs and hurt the economy.

300,Environmentalists dispute oil and gas industry's fears of leasing pause,currentargus,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 02:00:00,"A study showed the oil and gas industry in New Mexico forfeited more than 1 million acres in unused leases between 2011 and 2020. View Comments Days before the U.S. Department of Interior planned a public forum on its review of federal oil and gas leasing  amid a pause on new leases instituted by President Joe Biden upon taking office in January  conservation groups accused the industry of exaggerating the impact of the executive actions. Fossil fuel supporters in New Mexico argued the state could be the hardest hit by a disruption in oil and gas production, as more than half of its operations occur on federal land and extraction provides about a third of the states budget. Former President of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association Ryan Flynn, who stepped down from the past last week, was swift to criticize the move as a blockade on New Mexicos economy that could imperil oil and gas communities in the southeast Permian Basin and northwest San Juan Basin. More: New Mexico's political leaders call for President Biden to end oil and gas restrictions Flynn was joined by myriad other trade groups and industry advocates in renouncing the halt on federal leases. We share the new administrations commitment to reducing emissions and combating climate change, but we do not make progress by sacrificing New Mexico communities like Carlsbad, Farmington, or Hobbs, Flynn said. New Mexicans are eager to work, and our country and state is best served by keeping their jobs here at home, rather than outsourcing them abroad. More: Deb Haaland to lead Interior amid concerns from New Mexico oil and gas industry But a Tuesday study from the Center for Western Prioritiesshowed the oil and gas industry could have leased more land that it knew what to do with. Between 2011 and 2020, the industry forfeited more than 1 million acres of unused federal land in New Mexico leased for oil and gas development, per the study. And from 2016 to 2020, more than 3,800 approved applications to permit drilling (APDs), about 58 percent of APDs issued during that time frame, either expired without being used or continue to sit idle. More: Lujan Grisham joins state leaders voicing concerns for Biden's halt on oil and gas leases Executive Director at the Center Jennifer Rokala argued this meant the industry would not be as negatively impacted by Bidens actions as its supported claimed, and that the backlog of approved leases and permits would be able to sustain oil and gas production during the halt on new leases and while the federal program is reviewed. The oil and gas industry has surrendered millions of acres over the past decade, showing that their attempts to paint the Biden administrations temporary leasing pause as catastrophic are disingenuous, she said. Operators have forfeited numerous tangible opportunities to drill, wasting government resources while demonstrating that they have no urgent need for additional federal leases or permits.

By Max Levy| mlevy@prairiemountainmedia.com| Loveland Reporter-Herald PUBLISHED: March 22, 2021 at 9:50 p.m. | UPDATED: March 22, 2021 at 9:50 p.m. Larimer County commissioners and staffers again heard from members of the public about the prospect of modifying local oil and gas regulations on Monday. The county is in the process of updating its oil and gas land use rules, which were introduced last year, in light of new state regulations as well as the election of two county commissioners seeking greater oversight of the industry. County consultant Matt Sura delivered his analysis of how the countys rules stack up against new rules promulgated by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. In a memo, he described the local rules passed in April 2020 as being among the most stringent local government regulations in the state at that time. They wound up being as strict as or stricter than the COGCCs new rulebook, with a few exceptions, including setbacks from housing, noise mitigation, required planning documents and enforcement policies. While Larimer County requires that oil and gas operations be set back at least 1,000 feet from any building unit, the state rules go further in places, mandating a minimum 2,000 feet from schools. Any operation looking to set up less than 2,000 feet from another type of building must go through a state hearing process, and operators cant set up any closer than 500 feet from a building. Regarding noise, the state requires continuous monitoring when an operation is less than 2,000 feet from a home, while the county does not require continuous monitoring of any kind. It also does not limit noise using all of the same metrics as the state. Operators must provide 12 types planning documents to the county, while the state requires 20. Finally, concerning enforcement, the COGCC has more than 40 inspectors, enforcement officers and environmental specialists, and is empowered to impose fines as high as $15,000 per day. Larimer Countys resources are more limited, though the county reserves the right to inspect the property for compliance, and may sue or yank permits from noncompliant operators. Even though county rules lag behind the states in a few areas, operators are generally required to abide by the stricter of the two. Sura encouraged the public to be patient as local governments develop their rules, which they were only empowered to do recently with the passage of Senate Bill 181. While I know that there is some feeling of urgency among the public, and we are certainly moving as fast as we can, and weve got a moratorium in place, we recognize that this is something thats pretty new to Colorado generally, he said. He said Larimer Countys rules are particularly strict given its place among the top 15 oil and gas-producing counties in the state. Many members of the public who commented represented the oil and gas industry or spoke in favor of the county exercising caution in its regulatory fine-tuning. Melinda Ford, who said she has lived in Fort Collins for 50 years, called the industry vital and said new regulations had already left her nephew out of a job. These new regulations are making it so that the only places that meet the criteria are on federal land, and getting permits to drill there is not happening, she said. This means that the oil and gas industry will likely dry up in the next 5 to 10 years. They definitely provide jobs, which are so necessary  and along with that are the housing needs, Beverly Perina of Armadillo Property Management in Fort Collins said. We have folks who are either renting or owning, and now theyre spending money in our town, and theyre sending their children to school, and theyre becoming a part of that community which we love. Others said they believed the county was on the right track tightening its rules. Andrew Forkes-Gudmundson, deputy director of the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans, said one of the positive impacts of Senate Bill 181 was the sharing of evidence about the public health impacts of oil and gas for local governments to consider while drafting their rules. It generated, quite possibly, thousands of pages of evidence about the impacts of oil and gas operations and the potential solutions to those problems, he said. Im really encouraged by what Ive been hearing lately from Larimer County.  There are certain areas where the state is doing an effective job already, and there are certain areas where Larimer County is uniquely suited to build upon that. While commissioners were virtually present during the meeting, they participated little as they were also following the coverage of the Boulder shooting that left 10 people dead Monday afternoon. John Kefalas called for a moment of silence at the start of the meeting. Jody Shadduck-McNally said her son was present shortly before the shooting at the grocery store where it had taken place, but he had since texted her and was safe. The countys next public hearing on the regulatory update is scheduled for April 8. Topics to be discussed include land use, siting, infrastructure and setbacks.

306,"China increases oil and gas outputs, imports in H1",globaltimes,"Mar 22, 2021",2021-03-22 20:48:40,"Chinese oil and gas imports soared in the first half of 2020, partly driven by lower international oil prices, but experts warn that the industry could face sluggish demand in the second half of the year. China increases oil and gas outputs, imports in H1 By Wang Sheng Source: Global Times Published: 2020/7/16 20:48:40 Photo shows Keshen 605 well at the Tarim Oilfield in Aksu, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Photo: Xinhua Chinese oil and gas imports soared in the first half of 2020, partly driven by lower international oil prices, but experts warn that the industry could face sluggish demand in the second half of the year. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that in June China imported 53.18 million tons of crude oil, soaring 34.4 percent from a year earlier. China in the first half of the year (H1) imported 269 million tons of crude oil, an increase of 9.9 percent year-on-year, said the NBS. In June, China produced 16.24 million tons of crude oil, a year-on-year increase of 0.7 percent, a growth rate of 0.6 percentage points lower than that of May. In H1, China's crude oil output hit 97.15 million tons, up 1.7 percent year-on-year, according to NBS. Chinese oil fields have maintained stable operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, so outputs in the first half year have remained relatively flat, Gu Hongjun, a senior engineer at Xinjiang Oilfield Co of China National Petroleum Corp, told the Global Times on Thursday. Additionally, Chinese oil demand is expected to peak between 2040 and 2050, when Chinese oil output will continually increase to keep pace with demand, Gu added. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price for July stood at $40.81 per barrel, entering negative territory for the first time in April, while Brent crude for August delivery settled at $43.46 per barrel on Monday at 14:50. In June China imported 8.33 million tons of natural gas, an increase of 10.8 percent from a year earlier, a growth rate of 6.6 percentage points higher than that of May. In H1, China imported 48.36 million tons of natural gas, an increase of 3.3 percent year-on-year, said the NBS. The increase of natural gas imports is driven by China's new long-term contracts with Russia and low prices in spot gas markets, Bai Jun, vice president of Research Institute of Beijing Gas Group told the Global Times. In June, China produced 15.2 billion cubic meters of natural gas, an increase of 11.3 percent from a year earlier, a growth rate of 1.4 percentage points lower than that of May. In H1, domestic natural gas output reached 94 billion cubic meters, an increase of 10.3 percent year-on-year, said the NBS. ""Natural gas production growth will likely slow in the second half of 2020, if demand can't pick up pace with supply,"" Bai warned. Bai suggests that domestic oil companies should prepare for a rebalancing of the oil and gas market amid upstream investment contractions and a merger & acquisition push in the wake of the oil and gas price collapses when they do overseas investment and international trades.

307,Opinion: Colorados new cleanup and financial obligations of the oil and gas industry,steamboatpilot,"Mar 22, 2021",2021-03-22 12:52:00,"Unless you have an oil well in your backyard, most of you will probably not be aware of the current serious effort being made in Colorado to finally require the oil and gas industry to Rodger Steen For Steamboat Pilot & Today Unless you have an oil well in your backyard, most of you will probably not be aware of the current serious effort being made in Colorado to finally require the oil and gas industry to clean up its operating oil and gas wells and to accept responsibility for reclaiming the land after use. For federal mineral rights managed by the Bureau of Land Management, several bills are currently being considered in the House to address the enormous reclamation funding gap. At the state level and for privately-owned mineral rights, this effort is largely being carried by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. It does not make for exciting news, but it should because of the resulting cleaner air in the future and lower impact on both the federal and Colorado budgets: 1) The air emissions from these operations are invisible but contribute to toxins and ozone-precursors; and 2) the unfunded liabilities for cleanup of the impacted properties is estimated by the COGCC at more than $18 million (215 declared orphans at $82,500 per cleanup as of July 2020) for Colorado. This cost estimate addresses only the officially orphaned wells. There are multiples of these that are unlikely to ever produce again and will not have viable and identified operators but are not yet declared orphans, so the real costs to Colorado are expected to be much more. Until now, the oil and gas industry has gotten a largely free ride in impacting our health, welfare and environment, and leaving their trash when they are finished for us, the public, to clean up. This is changing. Regarding the environmental impacts, in the past two years, through Colorados SB 19-181, the industry is now required to install emission control technology, which has been available for more than two decades, that minimizes the emissions of toxins, other ozone-forming hydrocarbons and methane, a major greenhouse gas. Operators are now required to capture the useful gas product that they were previously free to vent (with or without flaring) to the atmosphere at no cost to them. They did not pay royalties on any gas that they vented; any gas not captured and sold was free to them. Operators are now required to regularly scan the wells for leaks with special hydrocarbon-sensing cameras and to repair them quickly. Frequent scanning is particularly important because hydrocarbons are slippery, in that they seep out of joints, connectors and valves easily and cannot be seen without that camera. There are many more regulatory changes, too numerous to list here, that move the tradeoff of production cost versus impact on the public more toward the publics interest. Regarding financial obligations for wells on non-federal minerals, currently our COGCC is in the process of establishing rules for requiring the industry to fully fund the cost of plugging old wells, removing obsolete equipment and restoring the well sites back to pre-well-use condition. This involves posting of bonds or other forms of financial value committed at the time of well permitting in an amount needed to fully restore the sites. An associated part of these new regulations is defining a clear trigger for declaring a well as abandoned and requiring cleanup. The industry has become proficient at never declaring a well dry and abandoned, so they never have to spend the money to clean it up. Similar financial obligations for wells on federal minerals are being considered by BLM through federal level legislation and under different political forces  not addressed in this article. A funding mechanism for wells on non-federal minerals is also being considered by COGCC in the current rulemaking for the more difficult issue of cleanup and restoration of the many orphan sites  sites that still have trash equipment, often still leak hydrocarbon gas and have no identifiable and financially viable owner. Restoration of these sites involves properly plugging the well, removing trash equipment and restoring the surface, including access roads, which are also considered the responsibility of the current industry to fund. In the past, a common business model of the industry was to pump a well nearly dry, then sell that well in order to dodge the financial obligation to restore it. The purchasing company would collect and sell the remaining oil, then declare bankruptcy, causing the well to be orphaned. We look forward to new rules that will eliminate these unacceptable business practices in Colorado. Rodger Steen is a 40-year resident of Colorado, currently residing in Routt County. During those 40 years he worked for industry and government agencies as an air-quality engineer, primarily specifying the proper air pollution control equipment for industry.

Colorado increases tax on oil and gas operators to fund regulators' $3.4 million shortfall Mark Jaffe Special to the Colorado Sun The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission on Tuesday raised the tax it levies on oil and gas production in the state to fill a $3.4 million hole created by declining commodity prices  with the support of both industry and environmental groups. The support on the part of industry was the product of the commission deciding to reduce the size of the new levy as a result of improving oil and gas prices. Scaling back the increase was a move in the right direction, and offered breathing room for the industry, said Rich Coolidge, director of regulatory affairs for the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, a major trade group. Matt Jones, a Boulder County Commissioner, however, urged the new, seven-member, full-time commission to press for the full increase in the production tax in order to fulfill the agencys new mandate to protect public health, safety, welfare and the environment.

Mr Kerr has written to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, asking for a reassessment of the rules. He said he had been contacted by constituents concerned they are having to spend 75% of their salary while spending 10 days of their allocated 14 field break days in quarantine hotels after returning from the Middle East.

The Scottish Government said it had introduced measures for those returning from North Sea platforms via non-acute countries, but there would be no exemptions from those acute risk countries including the United Arab Emirates Claim workers left without seeing families Mr Kerr said: Nicola Sturgeon told me at First Ministers Questions that she would write to me with clarification on the issue  however, I have received no correspondence and that sums up the SNPs handling of the quarantine situation for oil workers its been a complete mess. Im calling on the Scottish Governmentto set a date on when a review will be carried out on the situation for those who will barely be able to see their families for months if this continues. Oil workers abroad face spending less than seven days with their families over an eight-week period for just doing their job. MSP Liam Kerr. So many answers have been avoided by the SNP Government, who have their head in the sand on this issue because they know what a shambles it has been. Hundreds of north-east workers are based in the likes of the Middle East and have been treated as an afterthought through this whole process  its a disgrace. They have absolutely no idea how long this will go on for and have been given no clarification whatsoever. I will continue to push for answers and have demanded a quick response on the issue. In his letter to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Kerr said: The answer to this is a major issue and concern in the north-east and many companies and families are desperate for both your response but also some comfort that they may be able to spend their field break with their families or at least that a review might be imminent. No exemptions A Scottish Government spokesperson said: It is vital that we do everything possible to prevent the importation of Covid-19, and clearly we cannot risk variants from international travel undermining the deployment of vaccines. We have introduced regulations to ensure those travelling from an installation in the North Sea who have transited via a non-acute risk country or territory are not required to stay in managed accommodation but must to stay in specified premises.

India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) on Thursday maintained a stable outlook for oil and gas sector during FY22, driven by a strong demand revival for petroleum products and continued sound liquidity. Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], Mar 18 (ANI): India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) on Thursday maintained a stable outlook for oil and gas sector during FY22, driven by a strong demand revival for petroleum products and continued sound liquidity. The agency has also maintained a stable rating outlook for upstream oil companies and oil marketing companies, driven by their strategic importance to the government and for city gas distribution (CGD) entities due to their growth prospects. Ind-Ra expects a pickup in profitability for upstream producers led by higher crude prices and gas pricing reforms along with higher production. Although upstream companies have large capex plans and they continue to pay high dividends, the agency expects their credit metrics to remain strong in FY22 led by their scale and nature of operations and strong liquidity backed by availability of liquid investments, sufficient banking lines and access to capital markets. Higher domestic gas price can impact the margins of CGD players marginally though they will continue to benefit from their competitive position with respect to other fuels. Besides, said Ind-Ra, bringing natural gas under goods and services tax can boost the consumption gradually. While the agency expects only a gradual pickup in gross refining margins in FY22, led by a muted improvement in crack spreads of key products, the marketing and pipeline segments will continue to provide cash flow stability. Petrochemical spreads which had hit rock bottom in FY20 gained momentum over 9M FY21. Ind-Ra expects them to remain at higher than FY20 levels despite a sharp pick-up in feedstock prices -- especially naphtha. A lower subsidy burden and possible asset monetisation can help in meeting the high capex requirement of OMCs partly, though dividend outflows are expected to remain high. Policy-level changes during the stake sale of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd or changes in the subsidy-sharing mechanism will continue to be key monitorables for assessing the linkages of oil marketing companies with the government.

Larimer County commissioners on Tuesday halted permitting of oil and gas and ""1041"" land use applications until April 15 while county leaders work to revise regulations for the sometimes controversial processes. Democratic Commissioners John Kefalas, Kristin Stephens and Jody Shadduck-McNally approved the temporary moratoriums on permitting with a 3-0 vote. The county has worked for months on its rules for oil and gas permitting after the Democrat-controlled Colorado legislature gave municipal and county governments more control over future development during its 2019 session. County leaders adopted their first ever regulations on oil and gas facilities in April 2020, but citizen groups have asked for increased public health and safety measures. Previously: Larimer County adopts first ever regulations on oil and gas facilities While oil and gas development in Larimer County is a fraction of that in neighboring Weld County, citizen concern over impacts related to the Front Range's poor air quality and climate change have led to efforts to further limit development within the county. A citizen-approved moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, within Fort Collins city limits was struck down by the Colorado Supreme Court in 2016. The county's 1041 permitting process most recently caught public attention when commissioners in 2019 denied Thornton's plan to build a water pipeline through the county. A Colorado judge has since upheld that decision, stating that Thornton failed in its application to meet seven of 12 criteria for the project. The pipeline, opposed by potentially impacted county residents and environmental advocates, would pipe Poudre River water from near the mouth of the Poudre Canyon to the growing Denver-area suburb. Thornton officials said in February they would take time to decide on next steps, including whether to appeal the court's decision. Previously: Court upholds Larimer County commissioners' denial of Thornton pipeline The county has scheduled a public hearing at 3:30 p.m. April 13 to decide whether to end, extend or amend the new moratoriums, according to a county release.

It was a 60-day ban, and he was going through relook at it, the president, Louisiana Oil and Gas Association President Mike Moncla said. Moncla says their worst fear was that the president would extend that ban past 60 days. He says as the 60-day ban comes closer to its end, President Biden isnt easing restrictions. Hes enforcing new ones, cancelling the 80-million-acre Gulf of Mexico oil lease sale that was scheduled for March 17 in New Orleans. It would kill our state. It would kill workers, Moncla added. It would kill jobs, and it would be a terrible thing. Moncla says all they can do now is wait. Were hoping that Governor Edwards letter may have talked some sense into the president and that he wont extend that 60 days, he told News Ten. Moncla says the Gulf of Mexico supports 250,000 jobs between Louisaiana, Texas, and Mississippi and 98,000 Louisiana jobs offshore.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/louisiana-oil-and-gas-industry-in-danger-after-president-biden-cancels-80-million-acre-oil-lease-sale/

Normally, this is a subject that will dwell on the economic disaster of the past year  the sharp recession last winter, the huge spike in unemployment, the unprecedented surge in government debt. All of these are important, even urgent, topics for discussion, but were here to talk about vaccines and opportunity. Specifically, the vaccines coming out of the biotech sector, and the opportunities theyll bring. The rapid spread of COVID around the world led to huge push by the Big Pharma industry to create a working vaccine for the disease  a push that has had successful results. Two working vaccines were in production and getting to the general public before the end of 2020, and several others vaccine manufacturers had products in development or in approval in the early months of this year. It was an impressive display of medical and technological know-how, put to the public benefit. The advent of vaccines, however, did not put the COVID pandemic to rest. As this virus has been mutating, and new variants are beginning to spread. The existing vaccines may prove effective, but they may not  and just as we get a new flu shot every year, we may be looking at a situation in which we will need our regular corona boosters to cope with the shifting variants of the virus. And now we get to the opportunities. A global vaccination program, and new vaccines for new strains, will present a huge business opening for biopharma companies involved in vaccine research and production. Using the TipRanks database, weve pulled the details on three biopharma firms that stand to gain as the vaccination opportunities expand. Novavax, Inc. (NVAX) Well start in the DC suburbs, where Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Novavax is a specialist biotech firm focusing on developing vaccines for respiratory illnesses. The company was involved in earlier work on the SARS and MERS viral outbreaks, which left it uniquely pre-adapted for work on the COVID-19 agent; both the SARS and MERS viruses come from the same class of coronaviruses as COVID-19. Earlier this month, Novavax reported that its COVID-19 vaccine program had completed Phase 3 trials, and demonstrated a 96.4% efficacy against the original strain of the virus. In addition, Novavaxs vaccine is also in a Phase 2b trial against the South Africa variant of the virus. The company announced that data from that trial shows a 55.4% efficacy against the South African strain, in patients who are HIV-negative. In both studies, the vaccine candidate achieved its statistical goals, including 100% protection against severe disease and hospitalization. Covering this stock for B. Riley Securities, 5-star analyst Mayank Mamtani notes the companys successful vaccine trials, and sees them as the surest path forward for Novavax. NVAX [is] ahead in the marathon of building durable vaccines' franchise, primarily via designing multi-valent booster vaccine candidate that could also include both their late-stage vaccine candidates against C-19 and influenza,"" Mamtani noted. The analyst added, ""We continue to believe recent stock volatility presents yet another attractive opportunity to accumulate NVAX shares, particularly in light of a highly derisked catalyst profile constituting of several regulatory approvals globally beginning with reiterated guidance of U.K. MHRA filing in early 2Q and U.S. FDA filing within 2Q. To this end, Mamtani rates NVAX shares as a Buy, and his $397 price target implies a 74% upside potential for the coming year. (To watch Mamtanis track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street analysts agree that NVAX is a solid prospect for investors; all 5 of the recent reviews here are to Buy, making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. Shares are trading for $201.50, and the $307.40 average price target suggests ~35% one-year upside. (See NVAX stock analysis on TipRanks) VBI Vaccines (VBIV) The next COVID warrior were looking at is VBI Vaccines, another company that specializes in vaccine research and has taken up the challenge of the novel coronavirus. The company has a history of working with difficult to treat, chronic viral diseases, such as Hepatitis B, but has also worked with other coronaviruses in the past. The big news here came out earlier this month, when VBI and CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) together announced a partnership to use VBIs vaccine candidates in research against the B.1.351 variant of the COVID-19 virus. This is the South African variant, and is known to be more resistant to existing treatments. Development of a vaccine against this strain would be a major step forward against the COVID-19 pandemic. The partnership comes with $33 million in funding for VBI adapt its enveloped virus like particle (eVLP) vaccine technology against the South African variant. VBIs eVLP technology has already been tested in preclinical studies against SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 agent), and has shown promise in inducing antibody titers against all three variants. Additionally  and, perhaps, more excitingly  the vaccine candidate has also shown reactivity to HCoV-OC43, one of the already known seasonal coronaviruses. All of this has attracted attention from Raymond James analyst Steven Seedhouse. Partnership with CEPI coupled with our macro thesis on COVID (which is that the virus is endemic and variant vaccines plus annual boosts will be required for years or even in perpetuity) collectively sets up VBI for a meaningful elevation in profile of its COVID vaccine programs and more broadly its eVLP platform with an important organization (CEPI) that also announced a $3.5B initiative today to cut vaccine development timelines for future pandemics, Seedhouse opined. Seedhouse puts a $9 price target on this stock, showing confidence in a robust 159% upside for the next 12 months, and supporting his Strong Buy rating. (To watch Seedhouses track record, click here) Overall, were looking at a stock with a unanimous Wall Street analyst consensus  4 reviewers have weighed in, and they have all put a seal of approval here, for a Strong Buy rating.

View Comments The COVID-19 pandemic brought significant declines in New Mexicos economy across the state. The southeast region struggled with declines in the oil and gas industry, its main generator of revenue and jobs, as the industry remained a major economic driver amid the pandemic. An economic summary for Eddy County released in August by the States Economic Development Department showed the county lost 22 percent or $452 million of its matched taxable gross receipts (MGRT) between the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020, which ran from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020.

327,EPA ordered to pay oil and gas company $110k,stuff,"Mar 15, 2021",2021-03-15 00:55:22,"In a scathing Environment Court decision, the EPA has been ordered to pay $110k000 to an oil and gas company it prevented from disconnecting a floating production station off the coast of Taranaki. Initial legal wrangling failed to overturn the abatement notices and eventually, a two-day appeal was heard in the Environment Court which cancelled them in October. In the same month the Umuroa went into voluntary liquidation BW Offshore said it had cost $31 million to have the vessel at Tui in 2020 while it missed out on $46 million in potential earnings elsewhere. In November, the company made an application for court costs against the EPA of almost $300,000. It argued the basis for the EPA abatement notices was without merit or substance. ""The EPA did not file any expert evidence to support its arguments, in circumstances where it would reasonably have been expected to do so if there had been a proper basis for the abatement notices,"" BW Offshore said. The EPA submitted that no order for costs against it should be made against it. ""As a regulatory consent authority the EPA has performed it duties properly and acted reasonably, and the appeal arose out of a genuine dispute about legal rights - the effect of the 2017 Ruling - which was in the interests of the parties to resolve,"" it argued. In his decision, Judge Smith noted that it was unusual to award costs against a regulatory body, but that the EPA's actions displayed a level of blame that met the threshold for this. ""The EPA's case demonstrated a narrow focus, the EPA did not adapt to the changes that occurred between issuing of the abatement notices and the hearing,"" Judge Smith said. ""In particular detailed evidence as to the security of the field was provided to the EPA well before this hearing."" Judge Smith said that the EPA did not fulfil its role properly. ""No experts were called by the EPA, and the Profac report relied on by the EPA had not been reviewed in light of expert evidence from BW Offshore. ""As noted in the Court's decision there was no evidence advanced, either in the abatement notices or any time prior or since, that there are [environmental] effects from the disconnection that are more than minor."" New Plymouth mayor Neil Holdom, whose district's coastline would potentially have been affected by any oil spill, however, backed the EPA stance. ""There was widespread support for the EPA move because we all understood that they were exercising caution and looking to mitigate perceived environmental risk. ""We would rather they overreached and protected our environment and were very conservative than going with what companies are asking them to do to protect their own future profits."" Taranaki Chamber of Commerce chief executive Arun Chaudhari took a more dim view of the EPA's actions. ""The EPA didn't do it's due diligence properly and had a report that was not really reliable and BW Offshore shouldn't have had to sink in so much money when it was actually another company that went bankrupt. ""BW Offshore has been punished for no real fault of theirs really."" In November, the Ministry of Innovation Business and Employment, which is now overseeing the decommissioning of the Tui, signed an agreement with BW Offshore to remove the Umuroa from the field. The vessel is expected to leave mid-winter this year.

329,"LA clean energy plan: Cut natural gas, fight climate change",latimes,"Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24 12:00:46,"The plan would help fight climate change and reduce deadly air pollution from cars, trucks and power plants and gas furnaces. Los Angeles is one of the last places in California still burning coal for electricity  and if all goes according to plan, it could become one of the country's first major cities to nearly eliminate fossil fuels from its power supply. In a first-of-its-kind study commissioned by the city and released Wednesday, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded L.A. is capable of achieving 98% clean energy within the next decade and 100% by 2035, meeting one of President Biden's most ambitious climate goals. And it can do so without causing blackouts or disrupting the economy, the federal research lab found, undercutting two of the most common arguments used by opponents of climate action. The path forward for the next decade is clear, NREL found: Build solar farms, wind turbines and batteries as fast as possible. Get solar panels on rooftops, electric cars in garages and electric heat pumps in homes. And invest in energy efficiency and ""demand response"" programs that pay people to use electricity during times of day when solar and wind power are plentiful. The benefits would be immense: not only helping to counteract the climate crisis, but also slashing deadly air pollution from cars, trucks, power plants and gas furnaces, much of it concentrated in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color. Crucially, all the paths to 100% clean energy studied by NREL would be capable of keeping the lights on every hour of the year, the researchers say  even on the hottest summer and coldest winter days, even when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow for days at a time, and even when a wildfire takes down a major transmission line. That's a key point after recent weather extremes that highlighted the importance of a reliable power grid, including brief rolling blackouts in California during a heat wave last summer and multi-day outages in Texas during last month's cold snap. Or as Mayor Eric Garcetti put it: ""We can keep our medical equipment on, we can keep our refrigerators working, we can keep the city going even in the face of more extreme weather."" ""The top scientists in the world have taken this from dreamland to reality."" Garcetti said in an interview. ""There are hundreds of pathways that could take us to 100% renewable. It no longer should be a question of if, but when and how."" The NREL study team included nearly 100 people and was aided by the ""Eagle"" supercomputer at the research lab's Golden, Colo., headquarters. They conducted an energy systems analysis they believe to be unprecedented in scope and detail, running more than 100 million simulations since 2017 and integrating heaps of modeling data on electricity use, job creation, weather conditions, power lines and the potential for rooftop solar panels on houses across Los Angeles, among other topics. The possibility of reaching 100% clean energy by 2035 is one of several options the researchers studied in detail. Under a different scenario, L.A. would still get about 10% of its electricity from gas come 2045, down from 24% today. City officials say that would be in compliance with a state law requiring 100% clean energy by that year, under a contested interpretation of the law's wording. It's a point of frustration for clean energy advocates, who say the legislation's intent was clear. That relatively less ambitious option would cost Los Angeles $57 billion to $69 billion, depending in part on how many people switch to electric cars and electric heat pumps, and how good a job the city does cajoling people into using energy during sunnier, windier times of day. Getting to 100% a decade earlier  and doing so without gas or biofuels  would cost about $86 billion. The study doesn't offer a detailed look at how energy bills might change for Angelenos over the next quarter-century. It also doesn't estimate how many jobs might be lost in specific businesses such as oil refining and gas distribution, although it does project several thousand new jobs a year building and operating clean energy facilities under every scenario. But however fast or aggressively officials choose to act, getting to 100% climate-friendly power ""will not affect the City of L.A. economy, on net, in any meaningful manner,"" especially with the costs spread out over 25 years, NREL concluded. ""While there may be slight positive or negative impacts, these changes are small in relationship to the 3.9 million jobs and $200 billion in annual output in [the] L.A. economy as a whole and have an almost negligible impact,"" the study says. Asked whether he supports a 2035 target date, Garcetti hinted to expect an answer at his State of the City address in April. ""To me, accelerating the target date to 2035 increases the benefits,"" he said. ""Even if it costs more upfront, we know the long-term costs of living cheaply in the short term are too much to bear."" Still, just because 100% clean energy is possible doesn't mean it will be easy. Los Angeles will need to add 470 to 730 megawatts of solar, wind and batteries every year for the next 25 years on average, NREL found  three times as much as in recent years, on the high end. Building all those facilities will require navigating land-use disputes that are only growing more contentious as renewable energy developers increasingly lock up open space in rural areas. And getting all that electricity to L.A. will require building new transmission lines, which can take as long as a decade. Jason Rondou, director of clean grid strategy at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, cited recent power purchase contracts with a solar farm north of L.A. and a New Mexico wind farm as the types of deals the city will need more of, and fast. We dont necessarily have a year to wait to take action on this,"" Rondou said. The city will also need relatively expensive clean energy technologies to make sure the lights stay on at all times. Every pathway outlined by NREL includes geothermal power plants, which tap the Earth's subterranean heat and can generate climate-friendly energy around the clock, as well as pumped hydropower, which can store solar and wind longer than a typical battery. Several pathways in the study also assume the city keeps its 5.7% ownership stake in Arizona's Palo Verde nuclear plant. For Luis Amezcua, a Sierra Club organizer who served on an advisory committee that helped NREL design the study, one of the most important findings is that Los Angeles can stop burning natural gas for electricity, possibly as soon as 2035. The fuel has become a focal point in climate battles around the country, with some utility companies proposing new gas plants even as they pledge to eventually zero out their planet-warming emissions. Gas burns more cleanly than coal but is still a major contributor to climate change, especially after accounting for leaks from pipelines and other infrastructure.

331,Hess Sells Off Denmark Oil Assets,oilprice,"Mar 20, 2021",2021-03-20 15:00:00,"INEOS Energy has agreed to purchases Hess Corp's stake in two oil fields offshore Denmark, and aims to boost production in the country prior until 2050 Danish oil is attracting attention as INEOS agrees to purchase Hess Corps stake in two oil fields within EU producer Denmark.  INEOS has agreed the purchase of U.S. oil firm Hess' subsidiary Hess Denmark at a value of $150 million and aims to boost Danish production prior to the countrys planned termination of its oil production by 2050.  INEOS Energy, which currently works in Denmarks Siri field, will acquire the remaining 61.5 percent of the Hess-operated Syd Arne oilfield and a 4.8 percent stake in the Solsort oilfield.  In December 2020, Denmark announced it would ban new exploration and production of gas and oil in the North Sea from 2050. This comes after Norway announced similar energy objectives in 2020 in line with Paris Agreement expectations.  The government cancelled its anticipated eighth offshore licensing round and all future licensing rounds as part of the planned cessation of activities.  Denmark has held the title of the third-largest oil producing country in the EU for many years, following the U.K. and Norway, whose activities are also largely based around the North Sea. However, in 2018 it became a net importer of oil following a quarter of a century as a net exporter due to its shrinking oil reserves.  At its peak in 2004, Denmark produced 390,000 bpd oil equivalent but by 2020 average production dropped to around 70,000 bpd. This is partially due to the need to cease operations at Denmarks largest oil field, the Tyra field, due to seabed subsidence. The redevelopment of the site has put operations on hold for the next two years, with output expected to rise again by 2025.  INEOS currently produces around 60,000 bpd oil equivalent, and its increased capacity potential a boost in production by 6,000 bpd. The company plans to tap into Denmarks full oil potential before the national industry grinds to a halt within the next forty years.  INEOS chair Brian Gilvary explains, It takes us from a position in Denmark where effectively we ran an end-game to a position now where we can grow out to the mid-2040s.  In addition to traditional oil exploration and production, INEOS is also expected to develop its Greensands carbon storage project in Denmark. The idea is to capture and store carbon emissions from the oilfields to meet carbon-reduction aims in line with greener government policies. Carbon capture is becoming an increasingly popular form of carbon reduction as regulators put pressure on oil majors to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.  Using innovative technology, INEOS plans to store 8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions under the basin every year starting from as early as 2025.  Hess is also expected to win from the deal, using the sale to invest heavily in its Guyana oil production. Partnering with Exxon Mobil, Hess has seen success in Guyanas Stabroek Block with over a dozen oil discoveries.  The deal between INEOS and Hess is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2021, with 60 employees transferring companies. This means INEOS can quickly start ramping up production to ensure it meets its pre-2050 peak targets.

340,Nigerias Bitter-Sweet Oil and Dropping Rigs,thisdaylive,"Mar 21, 2021",2021-03-21 02:40:31,"Energy Although the price of crude oil inched down, a dollar or more, below $70, this past week, standing on a $40 per barrel-driven budget benchmark for the year, the economy is supposedly on an Viber Energy Although the price of crude oil inched down, a dollar or more, below $70, this past week, standing on a $40 per barrel-driven budget benchmark for the year, the economy is supposedly on an estimated $20 safe grounds. That safe grounds are still large and wide enough to accommodate the fuel price increase/subsidy removal brouhaha. However, what is unsettling to managers of the nations oil industry is the decline in the rig count. The revenue to be generated to fund the 2021 budget, is mounted on 1.8mbpd oil production. With a year-on -year drop by 27.8per cent to 135 in 2020, from 187 in 2019, and a whopping 70per cent fall in exploration and production from the 23 recording in the same period last year, to only seven in 2021, there is cause for panic. At this rate, can revenue expectations meet budget deliverables? Chris Paul reports At the time the price of crude oil hit the $70 per barrel boundary, before its snail slide within the $60s valley, a visibly uncomfortable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, quickly went on air to alert Nigerians on the negative impact of an otherwise great news. He warned of the imminent increase in the price of fuel that will arise from the upward climb in the global price of crude oil. Since that announcement, the nation has been plunged into her macabre dance on the slippery, but highly combustible petro-platform. Though that initial chaos fuel scarcity, queues and crisis seem to have simmered in the past few days; this is consequent upon the price gaffe by one of the agencies under the same ministry and the rancorously raucous response by all involved and all affected by the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) overzealous announcement. Even this, with all its problems is not really the cause of the fear gripping the government at this time. What may be causing the managers of the nations economy, sleepless nights is the fact that the means to accomplish the mission to producing the $1.86 mbd on which the 2021 budget is planted have greatly depleted. There are indications that oil exploration dropped in Nigeria by 70per cent, in February 2021, according to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, (OPEC). A major indicator of exploration, and production, Nigerias rig count, according to its March 2021 report, was put at seven. Compared to the 23, recorded in the same period of 2020, it shows a 70per cent drop. Some of the factors, according to industry watchers, that could explain this disturbing developments can be attributed to the prolonged Coronavirus pandemic, lockdown, reduced demand, low prices, and by extension earnings; which have limited the capacity of many companies to execute their capital projects. However, a deeper reading of the OPECs report reveals that for 2021, world oil demand is expected at 5.9 mb/d, to stand at 96.3 mb/d. Oil requirements in the first half of 2021 are adjusted lower, mainly due to extended measures to control COVID-19 in many key parts of Europe. Additionally, elevated unemployment rates in the US slowed the recovery process. In contrast, oil demand in 2H21 is adjusted higher, reflecting expectations for a stronger economic recovery with the positive impact of vaccination rollouts. In regional terms, OECD oil demand is expected to increase by 2.6 mb/d in 2021 to stand at 44.6 mb/d, while non-OECD demand is seen rising by 3.3 mb/d to average 51.6 mb/d, the report stated. The report averages non-OPEC liquids production at 62.9 mb/d in 2020, which is a contraction of 2.6 mb/d, y-o-y. It further stated that Non-OPEC oil supply in 2020 declined in Canada, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the UK, and Azerbaijan, but increased in Norway, Brazil, China, and Guyana. According to the report, non-OPEC liquids supply for 2021, will grow by almost one million mb/d to average 63.8 mb/d. The US liquids supply forecast remains unchanged, with the growth of 0.16 mb/d in 2021, although uncertainties persist. The main contributors to supply growth are expected to be Canada, the US, Norway, Brazil, and Russia. OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by 0.08 mb/d in 2021 to an average of 5.2 mb/d, following a decline by 0.13 mb/d last year, the report stated. OPEC crude oil production decreased by 0.65 mb/d, m-o-m, in February, to average 24.85 mb/d, according to Industry sources. Oil prices, meanwhile, inch lower as Crude inventories continue to build. This may explain why oil prices headed southward, as more countries in Europe suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine on blood clotting concerns, pushing back further Europes return to normal. Not even the record vaccination rates in the United States have been enough to arrest the slide amid continued warnings from medical experts that the U.S. is not out of the woods and any premature relaxation in movement restrictions could lead to another spike in new infections. As at the end of this past week, Brent crude traded at $68.03 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $64.55 a barrel. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a crude oil inventory build of 2.4 million barrels for the week to March 12, up/down from a build of 13.8 million barrels was reported for the previous week. The American Petroleum Institute (API) surprised markets, a day before, when it estimated oil inventory decline of million barrels; for the same week. Sequel to the wave of Arctic weather that swept across Texas, which prompted refinery closures and stocking up of oil, gasoline and distillates; huge builds in both crude and fuel inventories were expected in the past three to four weeks. Meanwhile, the EIA reported an inventory increase, in gasoline, for last week, at half a million barrels. This compared with a draw of ask much as 11.9 million barrels for the previous week. Compared with nine million bpd a week earlier, Gasoline production stood at 8.9 million bpd last week. An inventory build of 300,000 barrels, in middle distillates, was recorded for the week to March 12; thus comparing with a decline of 5.5 million barrels for the previous week, which happens to be the second largest weekly draw in a row; after a 9.7-million-barrel decline in inventories in the first week of March. Middle distillate production averaged 4.2 million bpd last week, compared with 3.7 million bpd a week earlier. At the midstream level, and operating at 76.1 percent of capacity, Refinery processing rates averaged 13.4 million bpd last week, as opposed to 12.3 million bpd a week earlier. Unfortunately, a major oil producing nation, Nigerias refining capacity is not captured in this global data of downstream statistics because of its dead refineries. The consequences of that is the emotional paradox, the country must experience in relation to price fluctuations in the global crude oil market. In other words, when her fellow OPEC members are clinking glasses in celebration of a price rise in the sale of crude oil, Nigeria sits and sulk in one corner, and perhaps drunk to stup",https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/03/21/nigerias-bitter-sweet-oil-and-dropping-rigs/
341,Oil Firms Discuss Return To Venezuela As Maduro Promises End Of Monopoly,oilprice,"Mar 20, 2021",2021-03-20 13:30:00,"Managers of foreign oil companies have been visiting Caracas recently to negotiate a possible return of international firms to Venezuela's embattled oil industry after Nicolas Maduro began promising earlier this year he would end the monopoly of state oil firm PDVSA Managers of foreign oil companies have been visiting Caracas recently to negotiate a possible return of international firms to Venezuelas embattled oil industry after Nicolas Maduro began promising earlier this year he would end the monopoly of state oil firm PDVSA, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing sources familiar with the talks.  Venezuela is opening up to foreign investment in its oil industry, Maduro said in January, in a bid to reverse a catastrophic drop in its output under the weight of U.S. sanctions. PDVSA already has overseas partners, but foreign investments in Venezuelas oil industry are capped at 49 percent of any given project to protect state control of the sector.  Now, with the industryand Venezuelas whole economyin tatters, this may have to change.   Venezuelas crude oil and refined product exports plummeted in 2020 to their lowest level in 77 years, as the U.S. continued to step up sanctions against Maduros regime and anyone found dealing with it. Last year, Venezuelas oil exports plunged by 37.5 percent, reaching just 626,534 barrels per day bpd, the lowest level since the early 1940s, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon and internal documents from PDVSA, cited by Reuters.  Earlier this month, Maduro said the Venezuelan National Assembly would consider reforms to the countrys oil law that would open the door to new business models.  Foreign companies have expressed interest in getting their hands on some of Venezuelas massive oil reserves, the biggest crude reserves in the world. But most international oil firms, especially the biggest ones with exposure to the U.S. stock and banking markets, will wait for U.S. sanctions to potentially ease before trying to enter the Venezuelan oil sector again.  There is some easy potential to increase production if sanctions enforcement declines, Francisco Monaldi, an expert on Venezuelas oil sector and a lecturer in energy economics at Rice Universitys Baker Institute for Public Policy, told Bloomberg.  A massive rebound in Venezuelas oil industry, however, would only occurif everwith tens of billions of U.S. dollars of additional investment.

Speaking to CNBC, Johnson said, I could actually see a number that could be north of 100 in the next, say, six to ... 12 months from here, noting the still strong upside potential of crude. To us, it looks like you could have more than 40% upside to get back to the old highs in 2018.  Johnson joins other financial professionals in their upbeat predictions for crude oil prices, largely driven by the $1.9-trillion economic stimulus package that Congress approved last week. That is widely expected to jumpstart the U.S. economy, boosting oil demand.  Global demand recovery is also a factor in these bullish oil price forecasts even if this recovery has been uneven, strongest in Asia and most notably China but slow to return to pre-pandemic levels in other key markets.  Then there is the supply side. OPEC has decided to keep its 7.2-million-bpd production cuts, which recently drove Brent over $70 a barrel, albeit briefly. If the cartel continues to limit production, the global oil market will swing into a deficit of some 3.5-3.6 percent of demand, according to Princeton Energy Advisors. And this deficit has the genuine potential to drive oil price closer to $100.  Yet nothing is certain, even with improving demand. Chinas oil storage space is filled to capacity, according to reports. In India, another major driver of global demand, fuel prices have gone so high they are dampening demand. And the country is already looking for alternative suppliers to the Middle Eastern members of OPEC because current prices are too high for it.  Not all forecasters are so bullish, however. A recent Reuters poll revealed a consensus price projection of $59.07 a barrel for Brent crude. Individual forecasts vary from $50-70 over the next five years, according to Bank of America, to $67 a barrel this year, according to Barclays, and $75 by the third quarter, according to Goldman Sachs.

In a report published earlier this week, Rystad Energy projected that at least 20% of the jobs in sectors such as drilling, operational support and maintenance could become automated by 2030. This could affect over 400,000 jobs in some key energy-producing countries, according to the firm. Rystad Energys calculations show that Russian and US employees could be hit hardest by the adoption of robotics across 94 points Robots could steal the jobs of around one in five oil and gas workers worldwide in the next 10 years as more companies turn to automation to cut costs, new analysis from Rystad Energy shows. In a report published earlier this week, Rystad Energy projected that at least 20% of the jobs in sectors such as drilling, operational support and maintenance could become automated by 2030. This could affect over 400,000 jobs in some key energy-producing countries, according to the firm. Rystad Energys calculations show that Russian and US employees could be hit hardest by the adoption of robotics across the petroleum industry, with as many as 200,000 and 140,000 people respectively possibly losing their jobs. However, the study did not say anything about possible job losses in Saudi Arabia, the worlds biggest oil exporter. Robots capable of replacing some roughnecks are being developed by Texas-based oil and gas drilling contractor Nabors. The companys website offers a wide range of robots capable of working on drilling rigs. For instance, its Electric Drill Floor Robot can reduce the need for manual labor on a rigs drill floor, while its Electric Robotic Roughneck can replace the need for casing crews. The adoption of robotics in the area of inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) operations, especially for subsea activities, has gained the most traction among operators in recent years, according to Rystad Energy. This includes remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and the snake-like robotics arms, like those developed by Kongsberg Maritime in partnership with the Norwegian national oil and gas company Equinor. [embedded content] While no worker would be happy to hear that he is being replaced by a robot, the companies they work for are set to benefit from the transition. Rystad Energy estimates that they can reduce drilling labor costs by several billion dollars in 10 years. For example, cuts in offshore and onshore drilling crews could save US companies alone $ 7 billion in wages. However, those savings could be partially offset by the considerable investment needed to introduce those solutions, according to Sumit Yadav, energy service analyst at Rystad Energy. Companies benefits would also depend on the cost structure and whether the robots are owned or leased, he added. Also on rt.com Taking man out of manufacturing? MIT scientists design two-fingered robot that can handle delicate human tasks (VIDEO) On the bright side, the energy experts say that not all automated solutions lead to a reduction in manpower. They also noted that full-scale adoption of robots may come not so fast. First, tests are still required to see how reliable robots can be in complex 3D environments like offshore platforms. Limited communication capabilities between robot units is another challenge, which could be both complex and costly to overcome. Moreover, labor organizations are likely to resist robot-induced job cuts, while robotized work processes may face regulatory scrutiny, according to the analysts.

Reuters MAPUTO  A natural gas project being developed by French energy major Total in northern Mozambique is beyond the reach of militants, a Mozambique army spokesman was quoted as saying in a radio report, in the wake of a deadly insurgent attack nearby. Source: Reuters Authorities have confirmed dozens of deaths in the assault by Islamic State-linked insurgents that began last week in the coastal town of Palma, in a district near gas projects worth billions of dollars meant to transform Mozambiques economy. The situation around Palma is still highly volatile, with insurgents staging attacks on two security posts south of the town on Thursday, a source involved in providing support for humanitarian organisations on the ground told Reuters. It is protected At no time was its integrity at stake, Radio Mozambique quoted army spokesman Chongo Vidigal as saying about Totals project on the Afungi Peninsula near Palma. Radio Mozambique added in its report published late on Thursday that the area around the Total project was being patrolled day and night to repel any threat. Total, which last week called off a planned resumption of construction at the $20 billion development due to the violence, told Reuters it had no immediate comment. Mozambiques defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Aid groups believe the attack displaced tens of thousands of people, many of whom fled to safety in dense forest areas nearby or by boat. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the accounts from Palma. Most means of communication were cut off after the attack began on March 24. Islamist insurgents have been increasingly active in the surrounding province of Cabo Delgado since 2017, although it is unclear whether they have a unified aim or what specifically they are fighting for. At least 9,150 people have arrived in other districts of Cabo Delgado since the attack began, with thousands more believed displaced within the Palma district, the United Nations said on Friday. The new wave of displacement has uprooted many people who had fled their places of origin due to the conflict in other parts of Cabo Delgado and had been seeking shelter in Palma, it said, adding the majority of those displaced were being accommodated by host families. Totals project is among ones worth a combined $60 billion that would reshape the economy of the southern African country.

Source: Reuters As with the ramp-up of U.S. oil exports that forced heavyweights like Saudi Arabia to find other buyers, what was dubbed Freedom Gas by the administration of President Donald Trump is also changing global energy flows and quietly gaining a stranglehold on key markets in Asia.

Natural gas flows to export terminals in the U.S. where gas is chilled to -160 C (-260 F) before shipment overseas totalled 11.8 billion cubic feet (334 million cubic metres) on Wednesday, according to one source. Thats a daily record and up from the daily average of 10.8 billion cubic feet recorded in March. LNG shipments from the U.S. to Japan, China and South Korea totalled 3.2 million tonnes in February, almost two and a half times the highest monthly levels before the recent surge. Graphic: LNG imports by region The U.S. has got more export trains running so it is exporting more and demand has been relatively strong in northeast Asia, said one long-time gas industry participant. Record cold temperatures and snow this winter pushed demand for heating through the roof and sent frenzied buyers into the spot market to seek cargoes. While March shipments of U.S. LNG into Asia have tailed off due to warmer weather they are still well above typical levels for the month, according to the Eikon data. The export bonanza being experienced by the U.S. caps the completion of the first generation of export terminals that the shale gas revolution allowed. But the next round of projects being developed will face tough competition from Qatar, which has announced plans for a massive expansion of export capacity and is enticing buyers with sweet deals. A recent 2 million tonne annual supply deal with Chinas Sinopec was priced at 10.19% of prevailing Brent crude prices, one of the lowest levels on record, according to the industry participant.

Energy demands have been projected to grow 50 percent by 2050, according to figures from the Energy Information Administration. The International Energy Agency, meanwhile, projects that even if every country meets goals under the Paris Climate Accord, oil and gas will still be 46 percent of that increased energy mix in 2040. That means oil and gas will be around for a long time, API President and CEO Mike Sommers said, but it doesnt mean the industry cant continue to make enormous strides when it comes to climate change. America has made significant progress in reducing emissions to generational lows, but theres more work to do, and theres nobody better equipped to drive further progress than the people who solve some of the worlds toughest energy problems every day, he said. As our industry accelerates efforts to advance groundbreaking technologies, reduce emissions and drive transparent and consistent climate reporting, we urge lawmakers to support market-based policies that foster innovation. Among the market-based policies API proposed, however, is a buzzword that certainly raises eyebrows in the oil and gas sector. Namely, carbon pricing. Lets be clear. A price on carbon is a tax on energy, said American Energy Alliance President Thomas Pyle, in a statement reacting to its inclusion in APIs proposed action plan. A national energy tax is an easy position for big, multinational companies to embrace because it gives the federal government what it wants (more tax revenue); attempts to appease the greens (it wont); and compels customers to pay more in taxes to the federal government in the false hope of avoiding additional future regulations (the progressives have already ruled this out). Those who are left out of the conversation are consumers, small businesses, the poor, seniors, and those on fixed incomes  basically everyone. But national organizations werent the only groups to pan the idea. North Dakota entities representing oil and gas interests had a similar reaction. NDPC is concerned that any government intervention into the marketplace for carbon or any other mechanism does not solve challenges and tends to only inflate costs for consumers while hurting the ability of Americas oil and natural gas producers to compete on a global scale, NDPC President Ron Ness said. We plan to engage, as we always have, in the regulatory process to ensure our voice is heard and attempt to educate our government leaders on how different proposals will impact our operations. Ness said North Dakotas oil and gas industry has continued to reduce emissions far more than other oil and gas producing nations, primarily through technological advancements. We are not ashamed of producing oil in North Dakota, or consuming it, he added. And we will continue to advocate for this industry that has improved lives all across the world and continues to provide economic opportunity for the citizens across our state. Geoff Simon, executive director of the Western Dakota Energy Association, which represents oil and gas producing counties in North Dakota, said carbon pricing is really just virtue signaling, and will drive up the costs of energy without doing anything meaningful for climate change. (It will cause) undue economic harm to American businesses, boosting their foreign competitors who incur no such penalty, he said. Higher energy prices also harm low income citizens the most, because they pay a disproportionate share of their income on energy. They are also potentially unfair to states that lie in harsher climates, like North Dakota, he added, where people consume more energy per capita than other part of the country. Monte Besler, otherwise known as the Fracn8tr, is a member of the Williston Basin Chapter of the API. He sees these types of things as mostly political fanfare that is unlikely to bring real change. Reality is, little will change on these controversial issues, because full compliance is likely to have an immediate negative impact on everyone in the form of higher energy costs, he said. Sommer, meanwhile, said API is not advocating for a specific framework, or even a specific price. It wants to see a market-based approach that is transparent, and that eliminates duplicative regulations in the sector. A policy that we would not support is a government-first mandated approach, he said. But the other side says that we dont need to do anything. What were pursuing here is what we think is the policy that is in the middle, and one that harnesses the power of markets to drive innovation, he said. Thats the main theme of the climate action framework we are unveiling today, which includes commitments that the API member companies are making to reduce emissions. It also includes government action that should be taken, and it has a key focus on innovation and technology, which is the only way that this country is going to meet the challenge of climate change. Sommers also said he sees a lot of room for common ground with the Biden administration in certain areas, among them, expansion of trade for American energy commodities like LNG. The debate in Washington has been bogged down by factions advocating for economic growth or environmental action, Sommers said. And the U.S. has proven over the last decade that we can do both. Drive down emissions, we can develop more energy and we can grow the economy.",https://www.willistonherald.com/news/oil_and_energy/staring-down-the-barrel-of-a-biden-administration-one-oil-and-gas-organization-makes-an/article_a2f1c788-9403-11eb-8a76-53cc1c7390d9.html

New York (CNN Business) Pioneer Natural Resources announced Thursday it will buy DoublePoint Energy, a privately held oil and gas company, in a transaction worth about $6.4 billion. The ""bolt-on"" acquisition will expand Pioneer's already industry-leading footprint in the Permian Basin, the largest US oil field, located in Southeastern New Mexico and West Texas. It's a show of confidence as oil prices recover from the pandemic. ""DoublePoint has amassed an impressive, high quality footprint in the Midland Basin,"" the eastern part of the Permian Basin, Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield said in a statement, adding that the deal ""will complement our unmatched position in the core of the Permian Basin."" The deal will give Pioneer access to about 97,000 contiguous net acres of mostly undrilled land, bringing Pioneer's total position to more than 1 million net acres, the company said. It expects the new acreage to be producing around 100,000 barrels of oil daily by late in the second quarter.

Companies that remained relatively healthy have increased merger and acquisition activity in the region as oil prices rise and the economy reopens. This is the second recent purchase by Pioneer (PXD)  in October, it spent $4.5 billion to buy Parsley Energy. ""It is somewhat surprising to see Pioneer announce another major acquisition so soon after the Parsley deal, but the company may have felt the assets are simply too close a fit with their existing position to pass up,"" Andrew Dittmar, senior merger and acquisition analyst with data analytics firm Enverus, said in emailed comments. Pioneer expects the merger will help it save an estimated $175 million in annual costs, or a total of about $1 billion over 10 years. That will likely allow the company to return more cash to shareholders. Pioneer's stock closed up more than 3.5% on Thursday.

Ajay Dixit, the chief executive of Vedanta Ltd's oil and gas arm, said the government levies 20 per cent cess on oil price realised and an equivalent amount has to be paid to the state government in royalty. On top of this, the government is entitled to profit petroleum of 50 per cent of earnings after deducting cost. ""In the present low oil prices, there is hardly any money left after paying cess, royalty and profit petroleum. There is a need to revisit these levies,"" he said. He said cess, which was brought in when oil prices were very high, should not be levied if the price realised is less than USD 45 per barrel.Also, the rate of profit petroleum also needs to be revisited. ""There is no way we can fund exploration in the present high incidence of taxation and low oil prices continue,"" he said, adding exploration is a risky business and not funded by debt.International oil prices had fallen to low-20s and have only in the past couple of days bounced to USD 27 per barrel on signs that the world's biggest producers are moving toward a deal to end their price war and cut output as the coronavirus eviscerates energy demand. Dixit said the outbreak of COVID-19 has cost the company 50,000 barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas in production.The company was producing 1,80,000 barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas (boepd) from its flagship Barmer oil and gas fields in Rajasthan before it took a maintenance shutdown in February. The shutdown was meant to hook up a new project that could have helped ramp up production further but it could achieve only 1,60,000 boepd. ""We would have been at 210,000 boepd but for the covid-19 outbreak. The contract labour went away (following the lockdown) and long lead equipment have got stuck in Italy and China,"" he said. ""We dont know when the labour will return and when we will be able to source the equipment.""The company, he said, is managing operations in Rajasthan with bare-minimum workforce. ""An acreage as large as 3,500 square kilometes is being manned by around 1,200 staff now instead of 7,500 in normal times. ""It has adopted stringent measures at its operation sites, to ensure a safe work environment for its employees, partners, all stakeholders, and communities. Moreover, through digitalisation, the company has also been able to empower the site workers to remotely manage critical operations. With just one-seventh of the workforce on the ground, Cairn's oil warriors are doing more than their regular shift, he said, adding the company was also taking measures to keep the community in Barmer safe from the pandemic. Over the last one month, in addition to all business measures, Cairn has marshalled all its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) resources, including its Mobile Healthcare Vans (MHVs), to spread awareness about COVID-19 related public health precautions, preventive healthcare advice, and kits among remotely located communities. Cairn teams, along with their network of NGO partners and district healthcare workers are out there every day, to drive awareness about prevention, risk mitigation, and first-response measures among communities, he said, adding face masks and hand sanitizers have been distributed and a quarantine facility with a 120-bed capacity, with meals provided three times a day for 150 people, has been handed over to district administration in Jodhpur.

367,"India sends out clear signal of its clout, foreshadowing coming changes in world oil scene",indiatimes,"Apr 02, 2021",2021-04-02 07:15:16,"If India is successful, it will set an example for other countries. As buyers see more affordable choices and renewable energy becomes increasingly common, the influence of big producers like Saudi Arabia could wane, altering geopolitics and trade routes. Comment Synopsis If India is successful, it will set an example for other countries. As buyers see more affordable choices and renewable energy becomes increasingly common, the influence of big producers like Saudi Arabia could wane, altering geopolitics and trade routes. Reuters Analysts say the oil spat does not need to spill over into broader strategic ties in other sectors. When India's government last month asked refiners to speed up diversification and reduce dependence on the Middle East - days after OPEC+ said it would maintain production cuts - it sent a message about its clout and foreshadowed changes to the world's energy maps. It was a move that had been in the works for years, fuelled by repeated comments from Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who in 2015 called oil purchases a ""weapon"" for his country. When the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries and Major Producers (OPEC+) extended the production cuts into April, India unsheathed that weapon. Indian refiners plan to cut imports from the Kingdom by about a quarter in May, sources told Reuters, dropping them to 10.8 million barrels from monthly average of 14.7-14.8 million barrels. Oil secretary Tarun Kapoor, the top bureaucrat in the ministry, told Reuters that India is asking state refiners to jointly negotiate with oil producers to get better deals, but declined to comment on plans to cut Saudi imports. ""India is a big market so sellers have to be mindful of our country's demand as well to keep the long-term relationship intact,"" he said. The Saudi state oil company Saudi Aramco and the Saudi energy ministry declined to comment. Pradhan, who sees high oil pricesas a threat to India's recovering economy, said he was saddened by the OPEC+ decision. India's fuel import bill has rocketed, and fuel prices  inflated by government taxes imposed last year - have hit records. The International Energy Agency forecasts India's consumption to double and its oil import bill to nearly triple from 2019 levels to more than $250 billion by 2040. An oil ministry official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the OPEC+ cuts have created uncertainty and made it difficult for refiners to plan for procurement and price risk. It also creates opportunities for companies in the Americas, Africa, Russia and elsewhere to fill the gap. If India is successful, it will set an example for other countries. As buyers see more affordable choices and renewable energy becomes increasingly common, the influence of big producers like Saudi Arabiacould wane, altering geopolitics and trade routes. DIVERSIFICATION DRIVE India's oil demand has risen by 25% in the last seven years - more than any other major buyer - and the country has surpassed Japan as the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer. The country has already curbed its reliance on the Middle East from more than 64% of imports in 2016 to below 60% in 2019. That trend reversed in 2020, however, when the pandemic pummelled fuel demand and forced Indian refiners to make committed oil purchases from the Middle East under term contracts, shunning spot purchases. As India shifts gears again after Pradhan's call for faster diversification, refineries are looking for new suppliers, the oil ministry official said. Costly refinery upgrades that allow for the processing of cheaper, heavier oil grades have encouraged importers to seek out far-flung sources. HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd bought the country's first cargo from Guyana this month, and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd just imported Brazilian Tupi crude for the first time. In past years, refiners have jointly negotiated oil deals with sanctions-hit Iran, which offered free shipping and price discounts, and now plan to do the same with other producers. Since the break with Saudi Arabia began, Pradhan has had meetings with United Arab Emirates' minister of state and chief executive of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, and U.S. energy secretary Jennifer Granholm to strengthen energy partnerships. Pradhan recently said African nations could play a central role in India's oil diversification. The country is looking at signing long-term oil supply deal with Guyana and exploring options to raise imports from Russia, the oil ministry source said. A separate Indian government source said the government expects Iranian sanctions to ease in three to four months, potentially offering India a cheaper alternative to Saudi oil. Two traders agreed that Iran stood a good chance to benefit from India's shift, as did Venezuela, Kuwait and the United States. An Indian refinery source said the U.S., Africa, Kazakhstan's CPC Blend and Russian oil would probably get a look too. Although Indian importers will scoop up increasing volumes of attractively priced global grades, most analysts expect the Middle East to remain India's primary oil supplier, mainly because of lower shipping costs. India's oil ministry is working with refiners on a framework to jointly negotiate terms with suppliers. ""Buyers have alternatives in today's market and these alternatives are going to multiply going forward,"" Kapoor said. ""There are so many companies in India that do buying at their own level, so these companies coming together also becomes quite a big bloc."" On Thursday, Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ agreed after discussions with U.S. officials to ease oil curbs beginning in May. Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman conceded that the production cuts had put state oil company Aramco ""in some difficulty with some of its partners."" THE RELATIONSHIP Analysts say the oil spat does not need to spill over into broader strategic ties in other sectors, including defence. ""Until recently, the balance of power was skewed towards Saudi Arabia, but increasingly, India is using access to its market and the diversity of options to put pressure on Saudi Arabia,"" consultancy Eurasia said in a note. ""For Saudi Arabia, losing market share in a global environment in which most developed economies are already seeing their oil demand decline due to green policy implementation, would be a blow."" Abdulaziz confirmed that Aramco had maintained normal April oil supplies to Indian refiners while cutting volumes for other buyers - a sign Saudi Arabia is concerned about India's search for new sources. Saudi Arabia is India's fourth-biggest trade partner, importing a slew of items, including food. Saudi Armaco is looking at buying a 20% stake in Reliance Industries' oil and chemicals business. It is also a part of a joint venture to build a 1.2 million barrels per day refinery in India. But Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at National University of Singapore, said it would be difficult for Saudi to find a stable alternative buyer if India continues with reduced purchases for too long. ""This bilateral relationship should not be impacted due to any decisions on one commodity. However in a global surplus, market buyers have a lot of negotiating power and source",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/india-sends-out-clear-signal-of-its-clout-foreshadowing-coming-changes-in-world-oil-scene/articleshow/81869689.cms

These reports revealed that a disappointment had materialised in the Block as the first completed well, Bulletwood-1, while encountering quality reservoirs, failed to yield commercial quantities. Bulletwood-1 was reportedly targeting more than 500 million barrels of oil in what was envisaged as a prospect similar to Liza 1 in the Stabroek Block. The reported disappointment over the outcome of the Canje Block probe however, appears to have done little to alter the broader upbeat perspective of Norways Rystad Energy, one of the more respected energy analysts globally. Rather, the company continues to spew an upbeat assessment of Guyanas longer term oil prospects. Indeed, it says in a recent pronouncement that it expects exploration activity offshore Guyana to rebound quickly from the Canje Block disappointment. There's more to this story.

Source: CNBC China outspent the U.S. by nearly 2-to-1 on energy transition-related investment between 2010 and 2020, according to BNEF data cited by Bank of Americas ESG Research team in a report last month. Pressure points including supply chain dominance, domestic-focused manufacturing policies, human rights-related laws and carbon-related trade tariffs, BofA analysts said. BofA managing director of research Haim Israel said a climate war between Washington and Beijing would follow the tech war and trade war as climate change becomes the dominant economic and political theme of the coming decades. Its not just about saving the planet. We believe climate strategies offer a route to global supremacy, as much more is at stake here: the economic impact of climate could reach $69 trillion this century, and energy transition investment needing to rise up to $4 trillion per year, Israel said in a research note in February. Energy independence and supply chain control are also at stake with the geopolitical balance of power also linked to peak oil in 2030. Israel told CNBC that the U.S. would look to ramp up legislation, innovation and capital flows into renewable energies such as wind, solar, batteries and hydrogen. We also see a ramp-up in electric cars. Remember that today, give or take, 50% of all oil in the world is allocated to the transportation market, and cars is a big part of it. So whoever will will definitely have a big advantage going forward, he added. Tensions between the U.S. and China have continued under President Joe Bidens administration, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken conducting terse discussions with Chinese delegates in Alaska last month. Harry Broadman, managing director and chair of the emerging markets and CFIUS practices at Berkeley Research Group, told CNBC last week that developed countries ability to create, execute and sell products that advance the climate agenda without negatively affecting the labor market would shape the economic landscape in the coming years. As long as people believe that there is going to be a market for such technologies and thats going to be dictated by how cheap it is, and whether it destroys jobs or creates jobs  it does not necessarily have to destroy jobs at all  that is going to be the driving imperative, and I think that race is already underway, Broadman said. Ahead of the Group of Seven summit in Cornwall, U.K. in June, Broadman, an assistant U.S. trade representative during the Clinton administration, said the group of major economies will need to drastically evolve their research and development and sovereign-to-sovereign science and technology collaborations in order to compete with China. The R&D7 Broadman is pushing for an R&D7 to be included on the G-7 agenda, similar to other working groups across members on issues of global importance. Its aim would be to reform the structure underlying the negotiation and execution of international science and technology agreements among G-7 countries. It would also form a stand-alone body tasked with ensuring that these agreements strengthen and recalibrate R&D collaboration within the G-7. Weve done really well among democratic countries collaborating on investment and trade, but weve done an extraordinarily poor job in R&D, and this is where China is frankly a huge competitive and potentially a huge economic and maybe geopolitical, threat, he said. China has pledged net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 . Countries operating net-zero pledges currently account for just under half of all global emissions, with China representing around two-thirds of these, according to a recent equity research report from Goldman Sachs. However, this could be a tall order, since China is by far the planets biggest polluter. The country accounts for around 30% of the worlds CO2 emissions, more than twice that of the U.S., and is rated by Climate Action Tracker as highly insufficient under the fair share principle in combating climate change. Goldman analysts led by equity business unit leader Michele Della Vigna plotted the countrys potential path to net zero by sector and technology, laying out the $16 trillion of clean tech infrastructure investments China will need to embark on by 2060.

Investors have also shown growing interest in companies seen as pioneering the energy transition, from electric vehicles to clean energy. As China finds itself incrementally boxed out of access to technologies from the U.S. and the rest of the G-7, Broadman suggested that a decoupling on standards would ensue , creating a China-centered orbit and a G7-centered orbit that would be unsustainable. There can be only one sort of standard in the world from a pure economic perspective. The economies of scale are so powerful that if you have two co-existing standards, someone is going to lose money, he said. Thats why I think whoever wins that race is going to be on top. That race has begun and the G-7 have not pursued this through collective action, and that is what they have to do.

Reuters HOUSTON  -Exxon Mobil Corp could post its first profit in five quarters on improved results across its businesses, with higher oil and gas prices providing a lift of as much as $2.7 billion, offset by costs from a February deep freeze. Source: Reuters The largest U.S. oil producer last year posted consecutive quarterly losses as falling oil prices and refining margins triggered write downs. It slashed operating expenses last year and analysts had forecast a per share profit of 54 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Exxon could top Wall Street estimates based on its Wednesday securities filing, according to brokerage Raymond James & Associates. The data point to a quarterly profit of about $2.55 billion, or 60 cents share, wrote analyst Justin Jenkins in a note. Shares gained 12 cents to $55.95 in late trading. The stock has gained more than a third this year to date. The February freeze that cut power to Texas refineries and chemical plants, and curbed oil and gas supplies, caused up to $800 million in damages and lost production volumes, Exxon indicated. ConocoPhillips and Devon Energy earlier warned of production losses from the cold snap. The filing showed refining remains a troubled business despite sequentially improved operating margins. Refineries have been especially hard hit by a pandemic-related drop in fuel demand and a recent rise in feedstock prices. That business overall could post a loss of $400 million for the period including costs from the freeze, estimated Jenkins. Exxons chemicals operation, its only business to eke out a profit for 2020, could get a $600 million boost over fourth quarter results on better margins. The business earned $700 million in the final quarter. Results are scheduled to be released on April 30. Reported first-quarter earnings could hit $2.34 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES, compared with a year-earlier loss of $610 million.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/exxon-mobil-signals-first-profit-in-five-quarters-on-price-gains/

LONDON -Oil prices rose on Thursday on optimism about U.S and European economic recoveries and expectations OPEC and its allies will keep production curbs in place. Source: Reuters Brent crude rose $1.02, or 1.6%, to $63.76 a barrel by 1339 GMT. U.S. oil was up $1.23, or 2.1%, at $60.39 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other allied producers, a group known as OPEC+, were considering output policy on Thursday. The group is debating options for May and beyond, including whether to roll over existing cuts or gradually increase production, three OPEC+ sources said. Saudi Arabias energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the markets recovery was far from complete. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in the meeting that he expected global oil demand to grow by 5 to 5.5 million barrels per day (bpd) this year. OPEC+ has reduced output by about 7 million bpd to support prices and reduce oversupply. In addition, Saudi Arabia made an extra 1 million bpd voluntary cut. Given the recent wobble in prices, along with demand concerns re-emerging once again, there is a growing consensus that the OPEC+ will likely roll over current cuts for an additional month, ING analyst Warren Patterson said. OPEC+ has trimmed its oil demand growth forecast for this year by 300,000 bpd because of renewed lockdowns. France entered its third national lockdown and schools closed for three weeks to try to contain a third wave of COVID-19 infections. Despite the new wave, European markets have recovered most of their pandemic-driven losses on strong manufacturing activity. March data showed euro zone factory activity growth galloped at its fastest pace in the history of the survey. Oil also found some support after President Joe Biden outlined a $2.3 trillion spending plan to invest in traditional projects, such as roads and bridges, alongside tackling climate change.

375,The 2 Nations Driving The Recovery In Offshore Oil,oilprice,"Apr 01, 2021",2021-04-01 21:00:00,"After an abysmal year, offshore drilling activity and capex are increasing in 2021, and oil majors are especially excited about prospects in Brazil and newcomer Guyana Offshore oil and gas drilling is set for a rebound this year following a major 2020 pullback when exploration and production companies deferred many activities due to the pandemic and the collapse in oil prices.  Lower lifting and breakeven costs at the most prolific offshore oil regions off Brazil and Guyana are setting the stage for a rebound in offshore drilling in South America, which will be one of the main growth drivers of global offshore activity this year, analysts say.  Drilling and well services spending in Latin America is forecast to grow strongly, thanks to continued offshore activity in Brazil as Brazils state oil giant Petrobras focuses on the deepwater pre-salt basin. The promising Guyana basin will also see new wells drilled and discoveries developed, according to the latest World Drilling & Well Services Market Forecast 2021-2025 Q1 by Westwood Global Energy.  Global Offshore Spending To Grow From 2020 Lows  Although operators around the world remain cautious about capex, this years expenditure on drilling & well services DWSboth offshore and onshoreis set to grow to US$156 billion, slightly up from last year. The higher spending will be the result of higher oil prices and forecasts of recovery in demand, Westwood Global Energy said.  The United States, China, and Russia will lead onshore drilling activities, while Brazil and Guyana will be the key drivers of offshore spending, the analysts said.  Rystad Energy also sees South AmericaBrazil and Guyana in particularas the main contributor to offshore drilling growth. Offshore activity is set for annual increases of around 10 percent in each of 2021 and 2022, the energy research firm said last week.  In contrast to previous years, when the North American shale sector led production growth, we expect the onshore and offshore shelf in the Middle East and the deepwater market in South America to be the main drivers of growth going forward, said Daniel Holmedal, energy research analyst at Rystad Energy.  Related U.S. Oil Rig Count Posts Double-Digit Gains As Oil Prices Rise  Offshore investment is set for a rapid rebound this year, driven by deferred projects from 2020 and a resurgent Petrobras, Thom Payne, Head of Offshore at Westwood Global Energy, wrote in an analysis in February.  Low breakeven costs make Brazils pre-salt and Guyanas basin very attractive drilling opportunities, even if oil prices were at $40 per barrel.  Projects in Brazils pre-salt region have breakeven oil prices as low as $35 per barrel, Effuah Alleyne, Senior Analyst at GlobalData, said at the end of last year.  Guyanas ultra-deepwater projects in the frontier Guyana-Suriname Basin have breakeven oil prices as low as $23/bbl, with short-term production expected to grow 10-fold by 2024 from projects such as Liza Phase 2, Alleyne noted.  Guyana  A Top Priority For Exxon  Exxons continued exploration and development on the Stabroek block offshore Guyana is set to drive offshore drilling in the country in the coming years.  Guyana is one of the top priorities in the U.S. supermajors strategy to focus on high-return and cash-generating projects that would allow it to grow its dividend through 2025.  90 percent of our upstream investments in resource additions, including in Guyana, Brazil and the U.S. Permian Basin, generate a 10 percent return at $35 per barrel or less, Exxons chairman and CEO Darren Woods said on the investor day last month.  Despite disappointing early 2021 drilling results, exploration activity in Guyana is on track to set an annual record of 16 wells, including on the Stabroek block, according to Rystad Energy.  Related Recent SEC Decision Could Spark Investment In Big Oil  Exxon is also currently developing the Liza Phase 2 Project, designed to pump up to 220,000 bpd with a floating, production, storage, and offloading vessel FPSO, with start-up expected in the middle of next year. Exxon has also recently made the final investment decision on the Payara oilfield offshore Guyana, expecting the project to yield up to 220,000 bpd of crude when commercial production begins in 2024.  Brazils Petrobras Focuses On The Prolific Pre-salt Basin  Petrobras is heavily divesting non-core assets onshore and offshore, as well as refinery operations, as it continues to cut its massive debt and bets big on boosting production and development in the very prolific and low-cost pre-salt basin.  Over the past five years, the share of the pre-salt region in the companys oil and gas production has jumped to 66 percent in 2020 from just 24 percent in 2015, Petrobras said earlier this year when it announced that its 2020 annual oil and gas production hit a record high. Production in the pre-salt basin totaled 1.86 million barrels of oil equivalent per day boed in 2020 out of Petrobras total 2.84 million boed output last year.  Despite the crash in oil prices, Petrobras continued its strong cash flow generation, with free cash flow at US$10.4 billion for the first nine months of 2020, Fitch Ratings said in February, affirming its ratings on Petrobras.  The strong cash flow generation, even with collapsing oil prices the primary result of cost and capex reductions. Petrobras reported a material decline in lifting costs in 2020 to around US$5.10 per barrel of oil equivalent boe from approximately US$9.6/boe in 2019, Fitch said. The significant decrease in lifting costs was the result of cost reductions and the growing share of Petrobras pre-salt production, which has a lower lifting cost than legacy production, the rating agency noted.

376,The future of carbon removal insurance: As big as oil and gas?			Canadian Underwriter,canadianunderwriter,"Apr 01, 2021",2021-04-01 20:51:20,"Carbon removal is poised to become a booming industry over the next 30 years, providing an opportunity for innovative P&C insurers to pioneer in carbon removal insurance products, Swiss Res chief risk officer predicts. By 2050, the industry of carbon Share Carbon removal is poised to become a booming industry over the next 30 years, providing an opportunity for innovative P&C insurers to pioneer in carbon removal insurance products, Swiss Res chief risk officer predicts. By 2050, the industry of carbon removal could actually be as big as the oil and gas industry today, Patrick Raaflaub, group chief risk officer at Swiss Re, told attendees of Swiss Res Canadian Insurance Outlook Breakfast on Tuesday. That is not an unrealistic expectation. Its an order of magnitude of the industrial sector, part of the economy, and clearly, from my side, an invitation [for P&C insurers] to explore and to actually be a pioneer. In 2019, Canadas energy sector directly employed more than 282,000 people and indirectly supported over 550,500 jobs, the Government of Canada states on its website. Canadas energy sector accounts for over 10% of nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Canadas GDP in 2019 was Can$1.98 trillion, according to Statistics Canada. In a slide for an audience poll, Raaflaub noted that between 120 and 160 gigatons of carbon would have to be removed from the atmosphere until 2050 to reach the Paris Accord target, which is to keep an increase in the global temperature to below 2 C. In 2019, global emissions amounted to 33 gigatons, Raaflaub slide notes. A number of nascent technologies have been developed to remove carbon from Earths atmosphere. Several are listed in a January 2020 working paper published by the World Resources Institute. The World Resources Institute suggests natural approaches for carbon removal could remove up to 10 gigatons of carbon in 2050. Examples include tree restoration, agricultural soil carbon practices, wood waste preservation, and extended timber rotations. Technology-only approaches would include direct air capture, carbon mineralization, and other capture and storage systems. Using a mixture of both natural and technological approaches could cumulatively remove 20 gigatons of carbon in 2050, the Institute states. All of the above technologies will be in need of insurance protection, as Raaflaub observed. If you think about all of these technologies and how rapidly they need to scale up in the next decades, it is clear that we are also looking at the very significant opportunity for, among others, the insurance industry, Raaflaub said. All of these solutions will need insurance protection, for very traditional property covers, engineering covers. They will challenge us in understanding them, but maybe even challenge our risk appetite. This is not the first time that the industry has marched side by side in significant technological development, and I think that will be needed. Apart from traditional covers, the new technologies will be linked to ancillary risks as well. For example, there may be an opportunity for insurers to provide additional or innovative forms of transportation cover, since some of the carbon removed from the atmosphere may not be able to be stored in the same place where it was converted into a storable form. Also, there will be reputational and liability risks associated with the new technologies. Some technologies  for technological reasons, or for other reasons  will not work, Raaflaub said. Or they will release the stored carbon dioxide over time. If, for example, you have [removed carbon] in [the form of] forestation, and the forest burns, the stored carbon is actually released. That could also be challenging, quite pioneering, but also an opportunity to provide some insurance protection.",https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/the-future-of-carbon-removal-insurance-as-big-as-oil-and-gas-1004205962/

Further clarity awaited on VAT for Omans oil and gas industry Further clarity awaited on VAT for Omans oil and gas industry in Oil & Companies News 02/04/2021 Oil & Gas activities will be zero-rated for Value Added Tax (VAT) only for the upstream and midstream segments of Omans hydrocarbon business  a key source of revenue for  Omani economy. According to tax experts of leading multinational professional services network PwC, downstream elements of the business  encompassing refining and petrochemicals  are likely to be standard rated at five per cent VAT, going by the Executive Regulations issued by the Tax Authority recently. The tax experts however hastened to stress that further clarity on the applicability of VAT for the Oil & Gas industry when sector-specific tax guides are issued by the Tax Authority ahead of the formal implementation of VAT starting from April 16, 2021. The comments came in a recent podcast, titled PwC Energy, Utilities & Resources Series  What do the new Oman VAT regulations mean for the Oil & Gas industry? A number of PwC tax executives offered their perspectives on the implications of VAT for the Sultanates pivotal energy sector. While the VAT Law promulgated last October allows for zero rating on oil and gas products, Executive Regulations issued last week further build on this definition by affirming that supplies of Oil & Gas, along with their derivatives, can also be zero rated for VAT. Accordingly, the zero rating will apply to related goods and services linked to the supply of oil and gas, they noted. Significantly, this zero-rating applies only to primary and intermediate oilfield activities, which correspond to the upstream and midstream segments of the Oil & Gas business, an executive said. So for upstream producers, the supplies with relation to exploration and production and extraction will be zero rated; the domestic production of oil and gas also will be zero rated, and any subcontractors involved in services in the production of oil and gas will be able to zero rate their supplies for upstream activities. Whats unclear at this stage is how far down that supply chain will zero rating apply. The keenly anticipated tax guides are also expected to shed further light on the need for service providers to be registered with the Ministry of Energy and Minerals to benefit from zero-rated VAT. In the Sultanate, contractors, vendors and service providers to the industry must necessarily register on the Joint Supplier Registration System (JSRS) in order to qualify to compete for oilfield contracts. The tax guides, according to the PwC experts, will also help address questions left unanswered by the executive questions, such as, for example, the treatment of VAT to Exploration & Production Sharing Agreements (EPSA), farming arrangements, and what the new levy means for operators and non-operators, and so on. Nevertheless, given the penalty regimes prescribed under the Law, businesses are encouraged to be fully compliant with the requirements of the new tax from the outset of its implementation, they added.

381,Could Bitcoin Solve The Oil Flaring Problem?,oilprice,"Apr 01, 2021",2021-04-01 18:00:00,"As regulators around the world crack down on carbon emissions from gas flaring, bitcoin could provide an unusual solution to what is becoming a very expensive problem As governments aim to curb carbon emissions from gas flaring, Bitcoin data centers offer a way to use this energy instead of letting it go to waste, in return for the digital currency.  Gas flaring, a byproduct of fracked shale production, produces around 1 percent of global carbon emissions at present. Companies burn the gas off at the well site, rather than using it as an energy source, because of its unprofitable nature. The alternative option is simply to vent the gas into the atmosphere, releasing methane and adding to harmful greenhouse gasses that have a knock-on effect on the environment.  However, several companies are calling for an end to gas flaring within the next decade and looking to find other uses for this energy.  Bitcoin producers realized this gas could be a great source of energy for small, transportable cryptocurrency data centers. One of the biggest problems faced by digital currency producers is the high price of electricity needed to farm the currency. But if this energy can be found cheaper from a product that would not otherwise be used, it could present the perfect solution for both industries.  In 2019, it was discovered that Bitcoin required more energy than the entire country of Switzerland for mining. This figure increased in 2020 and it is estimated that the Bitcoin network consumes around 80 terawatt-hours per year.  But the swinging price of Bitcoin and the Covid-19 pandemic deterred oil companies from making a commitment until now. Bitcoin did not appear a viable long-term option due to its volatility, especially when the future of oil was also looking bleak in 2020. While some companies took the plunge and trialed a Bitcoin-for-gas program as early as 2019, this was a widely overlooked solution to flaring and venting.  Related ExxonMobil Set To Outperform As Oil And Gas Prices Climb  Sergii Gerasymovych, the owner of a Bitcoin mining company, EZ Blockchain, reached out to oil and gas companies a few years ago to no avail. But The market conditions have changed, he explained. Now, every oil and gas company we reached out to in 2018 is calling us back because they see Bitcoin is making a lot of money.  Bitcoin is becoming increasingly attractive to companies looking to modernize and go digital with the price of the digital currency doubling during the last year, despite a pre-pandemic dip.  EZ blockchain has recently set up five Bitcoin mines on gas sites, the latest in Utah with independent gas company Wesco Operating Inc. Other companies using the innovative solution include Crusoe Energy Systems Inc., which has introduced low-cost/no-cost Digital Flare Mitigation programs with Bitcoin companies to put 20 data centers into action.  Other countries have also recognized the opportunity, with Russian companies developing similar projects. In January, Russian state-owned oil major Gazprom Neft has announced a successful pilot project that uses gas that would otherwise be flared to produce electricity to mine cryptocurrency at a Siberian drilling site.  Vekus was the first Russian cryptocurrency company to develop such an energy source for digital currency mining. Vekus used a shipping container to create an on-site mine, demonstrating the potential for digital currency mines to be placed on oil and gas sites around the country.  Russia is the worlds biggest gas flare producer, followed by Iraq, the U.S., and Iran, which in total accounted for 45 percent of global gas flares in 2017-2019.  Other cryptocurrency companies could make similar deals with oil and gas companies so long as they have proof of Work PoW option to process transactions. This could make digital currencies more sustainable in the long-term as electricity costs currently account for the majority of their production costs.

(""Namibia Critical Metals"" or the ""Company"" or ""NMI"") (TSXV:NMI) today announced that its JV Partner, Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation(""JOGMEC"") has officially elected to move to Term 2 of the JV Agreement and provide additional funding of $2,063,000 for further exploration and development programs at Lofdal through to July 31, 2021. The terms of the JOGMEC JV Agreement contemplate that JOGMEC provides $3,000,000 in Term 1 and $7,000,000 in Term 2 to earn a 40% interest in the Lofdal project. Term 3 calls for a further $10,000,000 of expenditures to earn an additional 10% interest. With today's announcement the total approved expenditures for Terms 1 and 2 are $6,163,000. The JV Agreement is structured such that no NMI equity will be issued and it is totally non-dilutive to NMI shareholders. Darrin Campbell, President of Namibia Critical Metals Inc. stated ""We are very encouraged by the results from our first year of exploration and development at Lofdal with our partner JOGMEC and are delighted with their decision to advance to Term 2. JOGMEC has been an exemplary technical and financial partner and has consistently demonstrated their intent to advancing the Lofdal project with the accelerated funding provided. Term 1 was increased from $3,000,000 to $4,100,000 (September 21, 2020 News Release) and now we have further accelerated budgets into Term 2 totalling $6.163 million. This partnership with JOGMEC brings all the necessary technical and financial capacities required to take Lofdal to commercial production. It provides alignment with, and access to significant industrial groups in Japan looking to secure long-term supplies of dysprosium, terbium and other heavy rare earths. JOGMEC is mandated to seek a stable supply of natural resources for Japan and they have recognized the potential of Lofdal to provide a secure and sustainable source of heavy rare earths. The development of a new mining operation and associated processing facilities would bring significant employment and economic benefits to Namibia, and specifically to the Kunene Region. We are excited to continue to work closely with our partners at JOGMEC in advancing the Lofdal Project to the next stage."" The Lofdal Heavy Rare Earths Project is located 450 kilometers northwest of the capital city of Windhoek in the Kunene Region of north-western Namibia. The project area covers 314 square kilometers centered on the Lofdal carbonatite complex which hosts a large number of rare earth occurrences, including the Area 4 deposit and the Area 2B deposit. Mineralization in both deposits is dominated by xenotime, a heavy rare earths phosphate. Lofdal is unique as one of only two primary xenotime projects under development in the world, the other project being Browns Range in Australia. The joint venture with JOGMEC is driven by Lofdal's potential to be a long term, sustainable supply of heavy rare earths for Japan. *About Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC)* JOGMEC is a Japanese government independent administrative agency which among other things seeks to secure stable resource supply for Japan. JOGMEC has a strong reputation as a long term, strategic partner in mineral projects globally. The mandated areas of responsibilities within JOGMEC relate to oil and natural gas, metals, coal and geothermal energy. JOGMEC facilitates opportunities with Japanese private companies to secure supply of natural resources for the benefit of the country's economic development. Rare earths are of critical importance to Japanese industrial interests and JOGMEC has extensive experience with all aspects of the sector. JOGMEC provided Lynas with US$250,000,000 in loans and equity in 2011 to ensure supplies of the Light Rare Earths metals suite to the Japanese industry. *About Namibia Critical Metals Inc.* Namibia Critical Metals Inc. holds a diversified portfolio of exploration and advanced stage projects in Namibia focused on the development of sustainable and ethical sources of metals for the battery, electric vehicle and associated industries. The two advanced stage projects in the portfolio are Lofdal and Epembe.

383,Oil and Renewable Upside? This Energy Stock Has It All,industryfocus@fool,"Apr 01, 2021",2021-04-01 11:08:00,"After 50 years of drilling the North Sea, Equinor is shifting its focus toward renewable energy. Mar 27, 2021 at 11:08AM Author Bio Daniel has been writing for Fool.com since 2019. A fan of value and dividend stocks, he covers the industrial sector, oil and gas, and renewable energy. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of Houston with a BBA in finance and marketing and a certificate in personal financial planning. Oil prices are surging thanks to an increase in demand paired with a supply shortfall. It's the exact opposite of the phenomenon experienced last year when there was so much extra oil that futures prices briefly turned negative. Higher oil prices will test the legitimacy of climate pledges, particularly from the oil majors. Most notable are BP and Royal Dutch Shell which slashed their dividends and vowed to cut oil production as part of a permanent shift toward renewables Rising oil prices could cause some of these players to rethink their commitments. However, there is one oil major that will likely stick to its renewable investment strategy -- Equinor ( NYSE:EQNR ) . Norway's energy giant is boldly investing in offshore wind energy. Here's why Equinor has what it takes to successfully transition to renewable energy. Image source: Getty Images. A brief summary of Equinor's oil and gas portfolio Equinor has been drilling the North Sea for 50 years. Even after all that time, engineers continue to come up with new ways to turn a profit from what's left. The company estimates it still has years of profitable reserves in its portfolio New discoveries are possible, but the general trend is heading toward less oil. In response, Equinor has cut its oil and gas investments and is focusing instead on profitability. Norway is Equinor's bread and butter but it actually only comprises 55% of the company's assets. In 2020, 64% of production came from Norway, 21% from North America, 9% from Africa, and 6% from various other countries. Aside from Norway, Africa, and Azerbaijan, all of Norway's other production regions lost money in 2020. 17% of Equinor's assets are in the U.S., but the region lost Equinor a painful $5.8 billion over the last two years. Norway and the UK were the only two countries where Equinor produced more oil and gas in 2020 than in 2019. Equinor is a top-tier offshore operator. But it's had more failures than success outside of Norway as of late, which is one reason why it's focusing on profitability instead of adding production. By making its existing operations as efficient as possible without investing too much in future oil and gas growth, Equinor has some of the lowest break-even levels of the oil majors According to its latest estimates, Equinor's new projects can break even at just $30 per barrel Brent, which is less than half of the current Brent price. If Brent averages $50 in 2021, Equinor estimates it can generate more than triple its 2020 free cash flow (FCF) and nearly double its pre-pandemic 2019 FCF. At a crossroads Equinor's potentially high FCF generation is impressive, but it's not because Equinor is necessarily flat-out better than its peers. Rather, it's mainly the result of not spending a lot of money and milking the reserves it has left. At the tail-end of an era, Equinor isn't having an identity crisis per se. But it's certainly at a crossroads of what to do next. Image source: Getty Images. Instead of going toe to toe with other oil companies that, quite frankly, are much better positioned than Equinor the company has decided to leverage its offshore expertise and harness the power of the wind If the idea that Norway's oil giant is drastically shifting to wind energy sounds fishy, that's because it should. After all, we live in a time when virtually every oil company is desperately trying to rebrand itself as a diversified energy company. There are plenty of cases where this is more for positive press than a true business strategy. Equinor certainly enjoys the positive press, but it also finds itself in a position unlike any other oil major in that its reserves are trending down, it has an impressive amount of wind potential right in its backyard, and it is majority-owned by the Norwegian government -- so its interests tend to align with politics. Released in January 2021, Norway's climate action plan involves reducing carbon emissions, converting to renewable transportation fuels, and enforcing strict carbon taxes. Just last November, Equinor pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and even said it expects global oil demand to begin declining in 2030. Norway's economy boomed as a result of 50 years of oil and gas production. Now, its reserves are drying up and it's looking to cut emissions. Equinor could very well make more major discoveries in the Barents Sea over the next 10 to 20 years -- so don't expect its oil and gas production to completely go away. There may even be times in the short term where production spikes to take advantage of market conditions (like we are seeing now). But given the Norwegian government's climate ambitions, it would seem that a steady downtrend in fossil fuel production and an uptrend in renewables will start to take shape in the coming years. Wind energy developments Equinor's renewable capacity remains little changed from 2019, but it did close its final investment decision on Dogger Bank A and B, partnered with BP and won the largest U.S. offshore wind contract in history, and started construction on its floating offshore wind project, Hywind Tampen. The biggest change in Equinor's leading offshore wind portfoliowas its $1.1 billion, 50% sale of Empire Wind and Beacon Wind to BP. The two companies will now partner together to build up to 4.4 GW of capacity along the U.S. east coast. Although Equinor's large-scale wind projects are still in their beginning stages, the company expects it will be able to earn between 8% and 12%in unlevered nominal returns (returns that ignore taxes, financial leverage, inflation, etc.) on its renewable investments over time. This preliminary estimate should be taken with a grain of salt. Equinor's projects are too early to have any firm grasp on profitability. As things develop, Equinor should have a better profitability reading. After all, a company that transitioned from a generally profitable oil and gas business to a money-losing renewable business wouldn't exactly be a great stock to invest in. Image source: Getty Images. Tying it all together Equinor is still mostly an oil and gas company but it has a plan to slightly increase production, decrease costs, and shift to renewable energy. Looking ahead, the company has some major developments materializing in its wind portfolio, which are impressive but need to be profitable for this strategy to pay off. If oil prices remain highfor an extended period, it wouldn't be all too surprising to see other big oil companies shift their renewable focus. I could see Equinor tweaking its strategy and taking advantage of higher prices in the short term. But over the long term, the company's alignment with Norway's environmentally friendly politica",http://industryfocus@fool.com/investing/2021/03/27/oil-and-renewable-upside-this-energy-stock-has-it/

Brent crude rose by $1.33 cents, or 2.1%, to $64.07 a barrel by 1023 GMT. U.S. oil was up $1.36, or 2.3%, at $60.52 a barrel. Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Russia and other allied producers, a group known as OPEC+, meet on Thursday to reassess output policy. OPEC+ will debate options from May and beyond, including a rollover of existing cuts and a gradual increase of production, three OPEC+ sources said. OPEC+ has reduced output by about 7 million barrels per day (bpd) to support prices and reduce oversupply. In addition, Saudi Arabiamade an extra 1 million bpd voluntary cut. ""Given the recent wobble in prices, along with demand concerns re-emerging once again, there is a growing consensus that the OPEC+ will likely roll over current cuts for an additional month,"" ING analyst Warren Patterson said. OPEC+ has trimmed its oil demand growth forecast for this year by 300,000 bpd because of renewed lockdowns.

388,The Oil and Gas Industry is in denial about its own demise,fastcompany,"Apr 01, 2021",2021-04-01 07:00:17,"Trade groups have thrown a fit over Bidens pause on new oil and gas leases. They have much bigger things to worry about. advertisement advertisement In one of his first acts as president, Joe Biden pausednew oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. Companies can still drill areas they had previously leased, and they can still lease state and private lands. They just cant stock up on new federal leases. advertisement advertisement In response to this order, the oil and gas industry and its allies have thrown a fit. The American Petroleum Institute breathlessly warnedof a shortage of homegrown oil and gas. The Western Energy Alliance funded an ad campaign that grossly exaggeratedthe potential job loss. And last week, 14 state attorneys general piled on by filing suit calling the move reckless. All of this kvetching represents an acute form of denial about the impact of Bidens drilling policy and the future of oil and gas. The pause, which is temporary, is expected to have little effect. Federal lands account for just a fraction of U.S. oil and gas production, and because of the delay between leasing and drilling, Bidens order wont affect production until next year. Even then, it will only blunt oil output by 100,000 barrels a day according to the Energy Information Administration. Production is still projected to reach 12 million barrels a day in 2022, a near all-time high. Oil and gas companies are currently sitting on 23 million acresof unused federal leases, an area roughly the size of Indiana. Thats enough to last the industry another 10 years, by one estimate And 10 years might be all it needs. Because in the long run, the problem for oil and gas companies isnt finding places to drill. Its being able to compete with cheap renewable energy. Over the last decade, the cost of wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries fell off a cliff Renewables are now generally as cheap as or cheaperthan natural gas. And this year, wind, solar, and batteries will account for around 80%of new power capacity, dwarfing additions from gas. For this reason, an analysisfrom Morgan Stanley suggests that we have nearly reached peak gas in the United States. At some point in the next few years, it will be cheaperto build new wind farms and solar arrays than to keep the lights on at aging gas-fired power plants, and that will be the beginning of the end for natural gas as a power source. advertisement At the same time, its possible that we have already reached peak oil, according to an analysisfrom BP, an oil company. Repeated coronavirus lockdowns have hurt demand for fuel. And while the economy will eventually recover, and a lot of people will head back to the office, they will do so at a time when EVs are ascendant. Electric cars are already generally cheaper to ownthan comparable gas-powered cars, thanks to savings on fuel and repairs, and soon they will boast a smaller sticker priceas well. Its not just new power plants and cars that pose a challenge to fossil fuels. Emerging technologies threaten every product made from oil and gas. Induction stoveswill render gas burners unnecessary. Heat pumpswill make boilers obsolete. Bigger, more powerful batteries will give rise to electric freight trucksand obviate the need for diesel. Biofuelswill allow jet airplanes to kick their oil habit. Even plastics, made from fossil fuels, will lose ground to plant-based alternatives Oil and gas companies arent going out of business overnight, but they are approaching their twilight years. Even if we do nothing to address climate change, global demand for oil will decline, according to a new analysisfrom Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Demand for gas in power plants will also fall. The industry will only be kept alive by demand for gas in buildings. If we do as the science demands, however, and rapidly phase outfossil fuels, we will be all but done with oil and gas by the middle of the century. Given humanitys general reluctance, thus far, to tackle climate change at the scale needed, this might feel unlikely. But the politics of climate change are starting to shift 2020 saw the biggest-ever California wildfire the biggest-ever Australia wildfire and the most named stormsin the Atlantic. It also saw the election of a U.S. president who ran on a $2 trillion plan to tackle climate change. advertisement California is now aiming to phase outcars that run on oil by 2035. The United Kingdom set the same goalfor 2030. Norway, a reliable overachieverwhen it comes to EVs, is aiming for2025. And, while oil and gas companies might take comfort in projections showing rising demand for gas in buildings, a growing numberof U.S. cities are banning gas hookups in new construction projects, effectively poking holes in the industrys last remaining life raft. The biggest challenge for oil and gas companies isnt too little supply. Its too little demand. So why is the industry up in arms about Bidens pause on new drilling leases? Its hard to say. Some companies, such as Exxonand Chevron are betting that as developing nations grow larger and wealthier, they will drive greater demand for fossil fuels. In that scenario, companies will need to get their hands on all the oil and gas they can. But analysts and investors are skepticalof the promise of endless growth. There may be a more simple explanation for why the industry is so resistant to the pause on new leases, one that has nothing to do with economics or policy. Oil and gas companies may simply be raging against the dying of the light. Since the days of Standard Oil, these firms have been some of the richest and most reliably profitable on the planet. That is starting to change, and the industry knows it. These companies cant stop the inevitable shift to clean energy, but they can refuse to go down without a fight. That means resisting every policy change, however inconsequential. Jeremy Deaton writes for",https://www.fastcompany.com/90621117/the-oil-and-gas-industry-is-in-denial-about-its-own-demise

U.S. oil was up 38 cents, or 0.6%, at $59.54 a barrel, having dropped 2.3% on Wednesday. Reuters April 01, 2021, 07:55 IST TOKYO: Crude prices rose on Thursday, recouping some of the previous session's losses on expectations that a meeting of OPECand its allies later on Thursday would yield output constraint in the face of resurgent COVID-19 infections in some regions. Brent crude for June delivery was up by 31 cents, or 0.5%, at $63.05 a barrel by 0159 GMT after falling 2.2% overnight. U.S. oil was up 38 cents, or 0.6%, at $59.54 a barrel, having dropped 2.3% on Wednesday. Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC) and allies including Russia and Kazakhstan, a group called OPEC+, meet later on Thursday to consider options that include an output roll-over and a gradual output increase. ""The most likely outcome of the ... meeting is no significant changes in production,"" Eurasia Group said in a report on the gathering. ""The caution on display in the OPEC+ discussions signals that any decisions on tapering will likely be delayed to the May meeting,"" Eurasia said, referring to the gradual supply of withheld production to the market. A lowering of the OPEC+ oil demand growth forecast for this year by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) also weighed on prices and made it more likely the meeting would result in continued restraint. On Wednesday, the Joint Technical Committee, which advises the group of oil-producing nations that includes Saudi Arabiaand Russia, made no formal recommendation, three OPEC+ sources said. OPEC+ is currently curbing output by just over 7 million bpd to support prices and reduce oversupply. Saudi Arabia has added to those cuts with a further 1 million bpd. The cuts came after the novel coronavirus outbreak turned into the biggest global health crisis in a century and led to the evisceration of demand for oil and fuel. Recovery has been intermittent as outbreak after outbreak of coronavirus infections leads to more lockdown measures. France President Emmanuel Macronon Wednesday put his country into a third lockdown and said schools would close for three weeks to cope with a third wave of COVID-19 infections that threatens to overwhelm hospitals.

392,"Oil & Gas Stock Roundup: Updates From Equinor, Ovintiv, Oasis, Eni & Schlumberger",nasdaq,"Apr 01, 2021",2021-04-01 00:00:00,"It was a week wherein oil prices finished lower but natural gas futures logged a small gain.On the news front, Equinor EQNR made a significant oil discovery in the Norwegian North Sea, while independent energy producer Ovintiv OVV divested its Eagle Ford assets for $880 million.O Published Apr 1, 2021 6:41AM EDT It was a week wherein oil prices finished lower but natural gas futures logged a small gain. On the news front, Equinor EQNRmade a significant oil discovery in the Norwegian North Sea, while independent energy producer Ovintiv OVVdivested its Eagle Ford assets for $880 million. Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.8% to close at $60.97 per barrel, while natural gas prices inched up 0.9% in the week to end at $2.55 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). In particular, the oil market extended its decline from the previous weeksand fell into correction territory. Coming back to the week ended Mar 26, oil prices fell, as concerns over the reimposition of lockdowns in Europe and a slow rollout of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine dented the outlook for the commoditys demand recovery. Prices were also dragged down by the U.S. government data showing another weekly build in crude, gasoline and distillate supplies. The obstruction of oil traffic along the strategic Suez Canal following the grounding of a massive container ship (which has since been freed) stoked further uncertainty about the market. Meanwhile, natural gas finished higher on the back of growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) export and robust industrial consumption, which offset bearish weather changes at the onset of mild spring weather. Recap of the Weeks Most-Important Stories 1.  Equinor recently announced the biggest hydrocarbon discovery in the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) year to date. The discovery at the Blasto prospect was made through exploration wells 31/2-22 S and 31/2-22 A. It is located 3 kilometers southwest of the famous Fram field. The location of the Blasto discovery is close to Equinors existing infrastructure, making it suitable for tied-back options. This means the development of the prospect in Norway will fall in line with the companys climate ambitions. It intends to decrease emissions from the Equinor operated fields and onshore plants in the country by 40% by the end of this decade. The new discovery can enable the company to boost production while keeping carbon-intensity low. It plans to become a net-zero greenhouse gas emitter by 2050. The integrated firms key strategy is to capitalize on the renewable energy space and align its operations with the Paris Climate Agreement. Thus, to combat climate change, the company is investing actively in renewable energy projects, comprising power generation from solar and wind energy. ( Equinor Discovers New Oil in NCS, Offshore Norway ) 2.  Ovintiv recently inked a deal with Validus Energy for the sale of its Eagle Ford acreage at a deal value of $880 million. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) companys CEO Doug Suttles believes that this divestment continues its proven record of optimizing non-core asset value. He further added, ""Proceeds will significantly accelerate the achievement of our debt reduction target and allow us to pay off near-term debt maturities with cash on hand. Our 2021 outlook is strong and we expect to generate significant free cash flow for the fourth consecutive year."" You can see the complete list of todays Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . In the last reported quarter, the company set a target to trim its total debt to $4.5 billion by 2022 end, indicating a 35% reduction from the current levels. Also, the plan included generating $1 billion from asset divestments. However, with the recent divestiture of Eagle Ford asset, the company now expects year-end debt for 2021 to be less than $5 billion, assuming $50 per barrel of crude oil and $2.75 per MMBtu of natural gas for the rest of the year. It also aims to reach its debt decreasing goal of $4.5 billion by the first part of next year rather than the end of 2022 as was previously forecast. ( Ovintiv to Sell Eagle Ford Asset to Validus Energy for $880M ) 3.   Oasis Petroleum OASreported that it entered a contribution and simplification agreement with Oasis Midstream Partners LP OMP wherein the latter will purchase all remaining interests of Oasis Petroleum in Bobcat DevCo LLC and Beartooth DevCo LLC. Via simplification, the midstream partnership (formed by Oasis Petroleum) will expand its interest in Bobcat DevCo from 35% to 100% and in Beartooth DevCo from 70% to 100%. Further, in an effort to simplify its corporate structure, Oasis Petroleum decided that in exchange for around $510 million ($229 million in cash and 14.8 million Oasis Midstream common units), it will withdraw its incentive-distribution rights under the MLP. Finally, in addition to its previously announced dividend of $1.50 per share annually, Oasis Petroleum announced that its board of directors approved a new $100-million share-repurchase program. The stock repurchase policy will run out on Dec 31, 2022. ( Oasis to Sell Its Midstream Assets to Simplify Structure ) 4.  Eni S.p.A. Erecently agreed to acquire FRI-EL Biogas Holding to boost its carbon footprint reduction efforts. Ecofuel, a subsidiary of Eni and FRI-EL Greenpower, an electricity producer from renewables, struck the deal. The acquiree has 21 biogas-to-electricity plants along with an OFMSW processing facility that processes organic fraction of municipal solid waste. Eni is planning to convert the plants to produce biomethane. Once the process concludes, the facilities are expected to supply more than 50 million cubic meters of biomethane per annum to the network. Financial details of the deal, which can make Eni a major biomethane producer in Italy, are yet to be disclosed. The move is expected to boost the energy majors growth in the circular economy, a regenerative concept that focuses on utilizing waste to create final products for consumption. The acquisition of FRI-EL Biogas Holding will be a noteworthy milestone in Enis strong focus on a greener future, abiding by the Paris Agreement. The integrated energy player is on track with the plan of full decarbonization of products and processes by 2050. ( Can Eni's FRI-EL Biogas Acquisition be a Game Changer? ) 5.  Schlumberger SLBrecently got a contract to drill 96 oil wells in southern Iraq. The contract has been valued at $480 million and the leading oilfield service provider will be working for ExxonMobil XOMand Basra Oil Company  a national Iraqi company. The news is as per Iraqs cabinet announcement. Notably, the authorities of the country have not disclosed specifically the site where the operations related to new drilling activities will take place. Importantly, in southern Iraq, this is not the first time that Schlumberger will be operating. In 2018, the company was awarded a contract by ExxonMobil to drill 30 wells at West Qurna-1 oil field, situated in the southern part of Iraq. The integrated drilling services contract was for a span of 42 months. It is to be noted that the West Qurna-1 oil field, with its 20 billion barrels of expected recoverable reserves, is among the largest oil fields in the world.

A Plaza man hopes his new book can help teach people of all ages just how important energy is to our state. This is a moment Lucas Wurtz has been dreaming about for quite a while. Hes not just reading a book to his son, Ferguson, hes reading a book he wrote, about an industry hes proud to be a part of. Wurtz is a facility specialist for Marathon Oil Corporation and a lifelong North Dakotan. I grew up here. We are very environmentally conscious. If anybody wants this place to be safe if anybody wants to have clean air and drinkable water, its people like me that are from here, he said. This book was an idea Wurtz tossed around for about six months. Now that its published and available to purchase, he hopes the story of Oscar the Little Pumper can shed some light on the importance of the oil and gas industry. I just thought maybe this would bring a little bit of awareness to the kids and maybe even the parents when theyre reading the book to their kids, Wurtz said. While I think renewable stuff is awesome like wind turbines and all that theres just, theres no replacement for petroleum products like plastic. And I just think its a lot of things that people just take for granted and they dont really think about. He hopes his book will get people of all ages thinking about those products, where they come from, and the people whose livelihoods depend on them. You can purchase Oscar the Little Pumper on Amazon.

402,Carbon pricing plans could transform upstream oil and gas economics,nsenergybusiness,"Mar 31, 2021",2021-03-31 14:34:12,"Putting carbon pricing plans in place could transform upstream oil and gas economics, according to analysis by Wood Mackenzie 31 Mar 2021 Only a few countries currently require producers to pay a carbon tax or participate in an emissions trading scheme - but Wood Mackenize believes that could be about to change as governments aim to meet decarbonisation targets Very few carbon charge regimes affect major oil and gas producing areas at a rate above $20 per tonne (Credit: Shutterstock/Oil and Gas Photographer) Putting carbon pricing plans in place could transform upstream oil and gas economics, says an analyst. As it stands, there are currently only a few countries that require producers to either pay a carbon tax or participate in an emissions trading scheme (ETS). But as governments seek to meet decarbonisation targets, that could soon change, according to analysis by Wood Mackenize. The energy researcher claims carbon charges are likely to come, and it believes they will transform the upstream sector affecting both asset values and the industrys economics. Governments have two options for imposing carbon charges on upstream operations, said Graham Kellas, Wood Mackenzie senior vice president of global fiscal research. They can either levy a carbon tax, which is where a fixed tax rate is applied to all carbon dioxide emissions, or implement an ETS. Under both schemes, the financial impact on specific projects can potentially be mitigated by an emissions allowance. Joe Bidens green agenda making carbon pricing charges more likely for US upstream oil and gas operations More than 60 carbon charge regimes currently exist at international, national and subnational levels, but very few affect major oil and gas producing areas at a rate above $20 per tonne, according to the analysis. Norway is the standout country for upstream carbon charges. As well as having levied a tax on CO2 since 1991, it is a member of the EUs ETS. The EU scheme, which the UK also participates in, is the worlds largest and most active of its type. North Americas first carbon tax for large oil and gas producers was established by the Canadian province of Alberta in 2007. British Columbia implemented a similar tax in 2008, with the Canadian federal government introducing a levy in 2019. Last year, the Canadian government announced its carbon tax rate would rise to the equivalent of about $135 per tonne by 2030. In the neighbouring US, the second-highest emitting nation Wood Mackenzie notes that President Joe Bidens green agenda is making carbon charges for upstream operations in the country far more likely. Norways carbon pricing plan to affect oil and gas producers The energy researcher said the Norwegian governmentsproposal to almost triple its overall carbon tax rate on upstream oil and gas operations makes a bold statement, considering that E&Ps operating on the Norwegian continental shelf already pay the highest carbon taxes in the world. Norways new carbon plan aims to reduce emissions from sectors such as waste and agriculture, which are not already exposed to carbon taxes. But oil and gas producers will also be affected. The proposals would see the combined Norway CO2 tax and EU ETS price reach $262 per tonne by 2030  nearly a three-fold increase compared to todays price, said Kyrah McKenzie, a member of WoodMackenzies upstream research team. The changes will increase carbon taxes to almost $2bn per annum by 2030, and would make up about $2 per barrel of operating expenses, similar to transportation tariffs. This could increase up to $10 per barrel of oil equivalent at more mature fields. Norways new carbon plan will affect oil and gas producers (Credit: Geograph.org.uk/Simon Johnston) But McKenzie said Norways high tax rates, against which carbon taxes are deductible, would help offset the rise, while the countrys low-carbon intensity also reduces exposure. As a result, the implications for asset and company value are minimal, she added. We believe asset valuations would fall by about 1% ($1.4bn), though company value could fall by up to 5% for those with more mature, high-carbon portfolios. While cessation of production may be brought forward at some Norwegian fields, the impact on recovery is limited. WoodMackenzies research indicates that less than 50 million barrels of oil equivalent would be left in the ground. Our analysis shows that the fiscal treatment of carbon taxes is arguably more important than pricing, said McKenzie. A $262 per tonne carbon price in other parts of the world would have more serious implications. Producers have already been including carbon pricing assumptions in their financial models Kellas noted that producers have been including carbon pricing assumptions  usually between $40 and $100 per tonne  in their financial models for some time. He said that at $40 per tonne, most asset values are relatively insensitive to the carbon charge, although he believes even that rate could wipe out the remaining value of some assets. But at $200 per tonne  a lower rate than Norway is proposing for 2030  a third of all assets would have at least 50% of their remaining value transferred in carbon charges, added Kellas. These figures assume all emissions are subject to any carbon charge, said the analyst. Actual exposure will be lower, depending on each governments willingness to offer emissions allowances in the form of free emissions credits. This is the most important measure governments can use to modify carbon charges, thereby safeguarding asset values and lessening the impact on investment in the sector. The other principal instrument to soften the impact of carbon charges is the ability to offset these against other payments to governments. While mitigating the impact of carbon charges is possible, it will be complicated to achieve in many jurisdictions, said Kellas. Countries with fiscal regimes including royalty, which is levied on gross revenue and does not allow deduction of operating costs, will be at a disadvantage relative to those with tax-centric systems. And, for upstream operations governed by production sharing contracts, mitigation will be even more complex. Do you have interesting content to share with us?

403,New Mexico spent millions plugging abandoned oil and gas wells in 2020,currentargus,"Mar 31, 2021",2021-03-31 09:12:00,"In Fiscal Year 2020, the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division reported plugging 42 abandoned oil and gas wells across the state. View Comments When an oil well is no longer needed operators in New Mexico are tasked with plugging it up, sealing it off and reclaiming the land back to its natural state. But when a company goes bankrupt or for other reasons becomes insolvent, wells are abandoned leaving that state to take responsibility. An orphaned well, when there is no present operator on file, can pose environmental and human health risks with unchecked emissions and potential impacts to local groundwater sources. More: Local New Mexico leaders defend oil and gas industry amid federal leasing review In recent years, the State of New Mexico and its Oil Conservation Division (OCD)  an arm of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD)  made plugging wells a top priority, hoping to mitigate pollution concerns but also creating jobs. In Fiscal Year 2020, which ran from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020, the OCD reported it plugged 42 orphaned wells at a cost of about $1.6 million. This is a large priority for us, said OCD Director Adrienne Sandoval. We want to make sure we are plugging as many wells as we can each year. We actually expect to get close to that 42 number if not match or surpass it this fiscal year. More: New Mexico breaks oil and gas production records in 2020 as COVID-19 challenges growth While the OCD reported it hadnt seen an onslaught of orphaned wells amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and historic decline in oil prices and operations, Sandoval said it could happen at any time if the markets recovery slows and more operators go out of business. As of March 24 in FY 2021, which ends in about four months, the OCD plugged 14 wells and spent about $588,749. Sandoval said the apparent decline was caused by the OCD reevaluating its process for plugging the wells to include more procurement efforts to include multiple well-plugging contractors. More: Impact of NM's oil and gas production on economy, families discussed in Artesia roundtable The reason the number has been lower this year, is we had to take a step back and say how do we do this more efficiently? We now have more than one plugging contractor. That allows us to spread out the work, she said. It slowed us down for a bit, but in the long run its going to help us be more efficient with the plugging that were getting done. Helping the OCD pay for plugging wells, operators must take out bonds when wells are drilled. When they abandon a well, the Division cashes those bonds to help pay for plugging and reclamation of the land. More: New Mexico enacts tougher emissions rules on oil and gas, calls for 98 percent gas capture The agency also has a reclamation fund and receives grant funding from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for work on federal land. The OCD estimated plugging a well can cost about $35,000 plus an added $50,000 to $80,000 in costs associated with reclaiming the land once a well is plugged. But a past of environmental damage can bring that cost into the millions. Theres the potential for a gas to escape. Theres the potential for an impact to ground water. There are multiple different layers and reasons why its important to (plug wells), Sandoval said. When the wells are orphaned, that means that basically there is not operator of record. Theyve disappeared in a way. If they have any bonds on record, were able to cash those in to help us. If thats not enough, we have the reclamation fund. More: New Mexico Indigenous leaders criticize oil and gas industry amid Interior's federal review She said the OCD hopes for about 50 plugged wells per year with the resources at its disposal and hopes more funding could come from the federal government to help address the problem sooner. OCD records show the State is aware of 121 orphaned wells on State land, 298 on private land and 293 on federal land in New Mexico. Thats 712 wells in total. At 50 a year, it could take the Division 14 years to complete the work. More: Ahead of Interior's oil and gas leasing forum, enviros dispute industry impact claims What we do is try to prioritize the ones that have the greatest risk. A lot of our limitations are due to funding in order to get those wells plugged, Sandoval said. We try to do what we can to protect human health but at 50 wells a year, we understand it could take a long time to get there. Additional funding would not only benefit the environment and human health, she said, but create jobs for oil and gas workers who might get laid off during downturns in the industry market. She said a lot of the same skills from well servicing and active operations would likely transfer to well plugging. More: Martin Heinrich leads Senate Democrats to reinstate federal oil and gas methane standards When the industry sees a downturn, often the service industries are the first impacted. Those are the same workers that could work for these plugging companies, Sandoval said. In general, a lot of the skills they were likely previously using will be useful in this work as well. Its transferable. With the changing federal administration following the President Joe Biden assuming office in January with a renewed focus on mitigating pollution from fossil fuel industries, Sandoval said she was optimistic New Mexico could receive more support for plugging abandoned wells. I think there is interest across the board and with Congress and we hope to be a resource as needed. But were optimistic, she said. More: New Mexico's political leaders call for President Biden to end oil and gas restrictions National trade groups agreed with the importance and benefit of plugging abandoned wells during a forum held last week by the U.S. Interior Department amid its ongoing review of federal oil and gas policy. The Department embarked on the review after Biden placed a pause on new federal oil and gas permits almost immediately after taking office. Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute said the trade group that represents more than 600 companies in all sectors of oil and gas production supports increased efforts to plug wells as a way to mitigate extractions environmental impacts. Our membership looks forward to working with the government. With it being both a priority for the industry and Biden administration we look forward to working on it, he said. It would be part of our priority of mitigating emissions within our own operations. More: State approves $500 million in capital projects.

Today, raising money for traditional oil and gas companies is full of holes and public markets need a big repair with some kind of Spackle. Likewise, the ability of former Wall Street darlings, the energy infrastructure companies (pipelines, gas processing plants, midstream in general) to raise money has also cracked.

Martelle: Welcome, oil and gas lobby to the carbon tax table SCOTT MARTELLE SCOTT MARTELLE IS AN EDITORIAL WRITER FOR THE LOS ANGELES TIMES. March 31, 2021, 12:00AM The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and dont necessarily reflect The Press Democrat editorial boards perspective. The opinion and news sections operate separately and independently of one another. The oil and gas industrys main lobbying arm said Thursday it would support a carbon tax, a big step forward for an industry built on extracting and burning carbon-spewing fossil fuels. But in reality, the move just means the American Petroleum Institute has finally joined a long-running parade. And while adopting a carbon tax would be beneficial, its only part of what we need to do to try to get our arms around global warming. Oh, and the API still presumes that the oil and gas sector will continue producing low-carbon fuels well into the future. That cant happen if were to work our way out of this mess. Ill dispense with the argument that climate change is bad and endangers human lives and society. Thats a given, like the sun rising in the east. Its also a given, climate deniers notwithstanding, that the unfolding crisis is largely due to human activity  primarily the reliance on fossil fuels for energy. How to fix this is where the real debate is taking place. And a carbon tax  which advocates say would better reflect the cost of burning fossil fuels and compel consumers to emit less  has been a popular way of marshaling market forces to reduce emissions. But the market is an insufficient tool for getting us out of this, especially with consumers blithely opting for relatively low-gas-mileage pickups and SUVs instead of electric cars or even hybrids. We need to change how we power just about everything we do, and quickly. Waiting for the market to shift on motor vehicles, whose years of productive lives extend into the double digits, will not effect change fast enough. Plus, the oil and gas lobby also seems to frame its vision of the future in terms of continuing to produce some smaller amount of carbon fuels, relying in part on nascent and questionable technology to suck carbon out of the air and bury it. If we dont put carbon in the air in the first place, we dont have to develop technologies to remove it. So lets stop producing it and focus our technological innovations on bringing clean power to every part of the transportation sector, and making renewable energy better, cheaper and more reliable. The Los Angeles Times editorial board endorsed a carbon tax 14 years ago, recognizing that the proposed fixes for climate change are as numerous as its causes. Most only tinker at the edges of the problem.  To produce the cuts in greenhouse gases needed to slow or stop global warming, the world will have to phase out the fossil fuels on which it relies for most of its power supply and transportation. That conclusion has only become more concrete in the ensuing years as weve watched climate change accelerate. So by all means lets have a carbon tax. And by all means lets do a lot more. Some auto companies are moving in the right direction by changing most or all of their production to electric vehicles. The federal government and states must do more to help build the power and charging infrastructure, and a carbon tax could help finance that transition. And, yes, a carbon tax will hit consumers. Some proposals call for carbon tax rebates, though that would make sense only if the rebates went to people based on financial need. But how much should the tax be? To some it ought to reflect the social costs of carbon emissions. Another approach is to set the carbon tax at a level to best drive the world to net-zero emissions by a certain date. Key is that a carbon tax should increase the cost of fossil fuels to consumers to add market pressure to broader regulatory changes, including much higher fuel standards for motor vehicles and better incentives for building and using mass transit (another potential use for carbon tax revenues). At a fundamental level, the world needs a rapid transition away from the oil and gas industry  a formidable challenge, given the decades of investment in pipelines, home-heating systems run on natural gas and oil, our massive global fleet of vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines and the cost of upending all that and replacing it with energy sources that wont boomerang on us. So theres a place for a carbon tax, and room for the oil and gas lobby to work with the rest of the world to transition away from its core business. I just wish it had joined the parade sooner.

LONDON   Energy trader Gunvor Group aims to cut its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 40% in absolute terms by 2025, the company said on Tuesday, and has set up a new subsidiary to invest in non-hydrocarbon projects. Source: gunvorgroup.com The Geneva-based firm, which is among the top five global oil traders, aims to cut emissions it produces directly, and those from the electricity it uses, against its 2019 total of 1.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Its new unit will invest in biofuel, renewable power projects such as solar and biomass, and the commercialisation of alternative fuels like hydrogen and ammonia, it said. The company, called Nyera, or New Era in Swedish, will be allocated a minimum of 10% of Gunvors net equity, amounting to at least $500 million with leverage over the next three years, it added. Gunvor hopes to invite partners to invest further, Chief Executive Torbjorn Tornqvist told Reuters, so we hope it will be substantially bigger than our 10% equity contribution. The energy sector has come under heavy pressure from investors and governments alike to move towards greener energy sources. Oil major BP plans to cut oil and gas output by 40% and boost investments in wind and solar, while Royal Dutch Shell is betting on power trading and hydrogen and biofuels markets as it shifts away from oil. Gunvor and other trading firms are investing more in gas as a transitional fuel to a greener energy mix, as its emissions, while still high, are lower than coal and oil. Our view is that we also have to deal with hydrocarbons and decarbonise them, primarily natural gas, because these will still be a significant proportion of the future energy mix, said Tornqvist. Our fastest expanding areas are LNG, physical natural gas, power, and were also beefing up our carbon emissions trading, he added. As part of its sustainability goals, Gunvors shipping arm Clearlake will convert its fleet to low or zero-emission vessels. The firm mothballed its refinery at Antwerp, Belgium but still runs two others, at Ingolstadt in Germany and in the Netherlands Rotterdam oil hub. The German refinery will undergo a turnaround in 2023 to boost efficiency and cut emissions. Rotterdams two crude processing units were shut in mid-2020 to focus on desulfurization. The plant has started using hydrogen for vegetable oil treatment and is evaluating the addition of an HVO unit to make biodiesel. Rival trading house Trafigura said in January it would cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% by 2023, and set up a new renewables and power division and green investment vehicle. Mercuria has teamed up with U.S. private equity firms to invest up to $1.5 billion in renewable projects, while Glencore said it plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/energy-trader-gunvor-to-cut-emissions-by-40-sets-up-renewables-arm/

After steady oil price gains earlier this year, OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, had hoped to ease output cuts But a fresh wave of lockdowns to prevent a new surge in the virus has pushed oil off this year's highs, and four OPEC+ sources told Reuters this would most likely encourage the group to extend cuts into May when it meets on Thursday. A Saudi oil source said on Tuesday OPEC+ had not taken any decision yet and discussions about policy had yet to start. The source briefed on the matter said on Monday that Saudi Arabia was keen to extend cuts beyond May and into June. ""They don't see demand as yet strong enough and want to prevent prices from falling,"" the source said. Under existing curbs, OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, have cut just over 7 million barrels per day (bpd), while Saudi Arabia has made an additional voluntary reduction of 1 million bpd. Last year, the group agreed to cut 9.7 million bpd, or about 10% of world output, but then eased back as demand recovered. At a meeting on March 4, OPEC+ surprised the market by deciding to hold output broadly steady, although Russia and Kazakhstan were allowed slight increases. A source familiar with Russia's thinking said on Monday Moscow would support extending cuts again while seeking another small rise in production for itself. Benchmark Brent crude, which climbed above $71 a barrel shortly after the OPEC+ decision, reaching its highest since the pandemic began, is now trading around $65. Alongside concerns about the pandemic's impact on demand, a rise in Iranian oil exports is also prompting caution. Iran has recently boosted shipments despite U.S. sanctions. At a technical committee meeting on Tuesday, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo ""emphasized the need to remain very cautious and attentive to changing market conditions,"" OPEC said.

While the Biden administration has good intentions regarding their commitment to action on climate change, Save Since Day One, President Joe Biden has taken action to fulfill his bold energy agenda. While the Biden administration has good intentions regarding their commitment to action on climate change, it is important to first take a pause and assess the consequences of these monumental decisions. I supported Bidens candidacy and thought he would be a refreshing change from the last four years, but I worry about the consequences of some of his actions. Bidens recent moratorium on issuing oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters has the potential to threaten thousands of jobs and be severely detrimental to Louisiana and other Gulf Coast regional economies. A Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association analysis last fall warned of the negative consequences from a proposed ban on federal leasing on natural gas and oil development on public lands and waters, projecting the Gulf Coast region would be among the hardest-hit areas with 48,000 job losses in Louisiana alone by 2022. This ban will harm states like Louisiana that develop their federal offshore waters in a safe and responsible way. As Louisianas governor, John Bel Edwards, recently pointed out, The continued leasing and development of oil and natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico is critical not only to the coastal Gulf states that host the infrastructure and support industries for the Gulf OCS exploration, but to the economy and energy security of the nation as a whole. We look forward to learning more about the Biden administrations plan and working together to achieve responsible energy exploration and production. It is apparent the Biden administration is focused on combating climate change which we can all agree should be a top priority. However, halting federal leasing could actually have the opposite effect. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, there has been a 10% decrease in net nationwide greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 to 2018, in large part due to a shift to natural gas for generating electricity. The United States has already seen a positive effect from shifting to natural gas, as our country has reduced emissions 57% more compared to emissions reductions from renewables over that same time period. A federal leasing ban could reverse decades of progress our country has made in reducing its carbon footprint and cause emissions from power generation to increase, as a result of a shift back to coal. It is also important to consider the benefits federal leasing has on our countrys conservation efforts. The Land and Water Conservation Fund relies on offshore oil and gas development to supply billions of dollars for state-run conservation programs. In Louisiana, this includes outdoor recreation, public parks, wildlife preserves, and the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Louisiana has received approximately $224.1 million in LWCF funding over the past five decades, protecting places such as the Bogue Chitto National Wildlife Refuge. This funding could be jeopardized as a result of the leasing ban. Louisiana and Gulf States are not the only part of the country that would feel the effects of the new federal leasing ban. In fact, New Mexicos governor recently expressed concerns regarding the bans impact on her state. New Mexicos Democratic Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujan also voiced concerns about the ban, and recently told Reuters that they have asked for financial assistance to offset the impact of the moratorium and give certainty as they plan for the future, and explained that New Mexico might also need more time to transition away from drilling. As the United States has no firm plans to reduce its demand for energy, we must remain committed to supporting an all-of-the-above energy approach that includes natural gas, nuclear and the continued development of renewables. We can find innovative solutions to combating climate change, without sacrificing thousands of jobs and billions in revenue from the oil and gas industry. Biden should reconsider this federal leasing ban; reversing course is a key opportunity for bipartisanship and clear economic benefit for several states across the country attempting to rebound post-pandemic.

It also affirmed the Baa3 rating on the backed senior unsecured notes issued by Oil India International Pte Ltd and guaranteed by OIL. At the same time, Moody's downgraded OIL's baseline credit assessment (BCA) to ba1 from baa3. The outlook on all ratings remains negative. ""The downgrade of OIL's BCA is driven by our expectation that the company's credit metrics will remain weakly positioned at least over the next 12 to 18 months driven by low oil and gas prices as well as additional borrowingsto increase its stake in Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) and fund the Mozambique LNGproject,"" said Moody's Analyst Sweta Patodia. ""The affirmation of OIL's Baa3 issuer rating reflects our expectation of the high likelihood of extraordinary support from the Indian government that results in a one-notch uplift from OIL's ba1 BCA,"" she said. Moody's said OIL's credit metrics were already weakly positioned because of low oil and gas prices throughout 2020. Even though oil prices have now started to recover, Moody's expects prices to average below historical levels at least till 2023. Incremental borrowings to fund the NRL acquisition and the Mozambique liquefied natural gas (LNG) project will further pressure OIL's credit metrics. On March 26, OIL acquired an additional 54.2 per cent stake in NRL for Rs 8,670 crore that was funded by a mix of debt and internal accruals. Moody's adjusted debt also includes 160 million dollars as OIL's proportionate share of debt for the Mozambique LNG project. Moody's expects OIL's leverage as measured by RCF/net debt will weaken to around 16 per cent for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 (fiscal 2022) from 51 per cent in fiscal 2020. These levels are significantly below the 20 to 25 per cent threshold required for the previous baa3 BCA. Nonetheless, Moody's said the NRL acquisition will strengthen OIL's business profile because it will increase the company's presence in downstream refining sector and make it an integrated oil and gas company. The acquisition will also help to partially temper the inherent volatility of the oil and gas industry.

The problem is massive: There are approximately 2.1 million unplugged abandoned wells across the country. The Texas Railroad Commission, or RRC, which oversees the states oil and gas industry, tried to make sure Weatherly would pay up, objecting to the states bankruptcy plan because it didnt include sufficient information about the amount of money that would be set aside for well cleanup and for the companys various creditors.

A federal judge in California Monday refused to dismiss the bulk of a class action against three energy companies accused of conspircing to jack up prices of key gasoline components. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File) SAN FRANCISCO (CN)  Three energy companies must face claims that they conspired for years to jack up prices of key gasoline components in California, causing consumers to pay artificially inflated prices at the pump, a federal judge ruled Monday. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley refused to dismiss the bulk of a consumer class action against SK Trading International Co. Ltd., SK Energy Americas Inc. and Vitol Inc. The companies allegedly started scheming to raise the prices of alkylates, primary ingredients for mixing gasoline, in 2015 after an explosion at an ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance, California. The accident impaired the refinerys ability to refine alkylates from February 2015 through June 2016, causing supply disruptions and higher prices. It also gave the energy firms an opportunity to jack up alkylates prices even higher while masking the cause as a mere supply disruption, according to the lawsuit. Emails from Vitol executives, which were cited in the lawsuit, show they planned to keep their cooperation with the SK firms confidential. In seeking to dismiss the suit, the energy companies argued there is nothing illegal about forming a joint venture and deciding not to publicize it. Judge Corley conceded that point but found claims that the joint venture was actually a sham were credible. The [consolidated class action complaint] plausibly alleges that the so-called joint venture was a subterfuge for an illegal price-fixing conspiracy, Corley wrote in her 22-page ruling Vitol and SKs supply contracts with ExxonMobil tied the price of alkylates to prices publicized in a daily market report published by the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), a private subscription service. According to the lawsuit, SK and Vitol agreed to manipulate trades they reported to OPIS to jack up prices for alkylates. This required the companies to take a loss on trades reported to OPIS, but they more than made up for it through alkylate sales to ExxonMobil, the lawsuit contends. The complaint further accuses the companies of engaging in secret second trades that were not reported to OPIS. These hidden trades ensured there was little market risk for either party, the consumers complained in their lawsuit. Vitol and SK asked the judge to stay the case because a separate lawsuit brought by the California Attorney Generals office over the same conduct is now pending in San Francisco County Superior Court. The energy companies cited a legal doctrine known as the Colorado River abstention, based on a 1976 Supreme Court case, which says federal courts should stay cases when an earlier filed parallel action is pending in state court. Corley found it would be inappropriate to apply that doctrine in this case because non-California residents and business would not be eligible for compensation through the state litigation. The AG Action does not and cannot seek redress for the claims of businesses or non-California plaintiffs, both of which are included as named plaintiffs and in the putative class here, Corley wrote. The judge also rejected arguments that the antitrust claims were time-barred under a four-year statute of limitations. The plaintiffs argued the four-year limit did not apply in this case because the California AGs Office had a tolling agreement with the energy companies. The plaintiffs also said it should not apply because they didnt learn of the concealed price-fixing scheme until May 4, 2020, when the AG sued the energy companies in state court. The first of many soon-to-be consolidated lawsuits against SK and Vitol were filed two days later in federal court on May 6, 2020. The judge dismissed the statute-of-limitations defense without prejudice, saying the energy companies could argue it at a later stage of litigation when more evidence is presented on the issue. Corley also refused to accept arguments that the plaintiffs failed to show the alleged price-fixing scheme caused consumers to pay higher prices at the pump. SK and Vitol said other factors, such as the refinery explosion, could have caused the elevated gas prices. Corley found that dispute must also be resolved at a later stage of litigation. The judge dismissed claims for injunctive relief based on alleged violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Corley found the lawsuit failed to show the price-fixing scheme was ongoing and that consumers will keep being overcharged without court intervention. The plaintiffs will get another chance to advance that claim in an amended complaint. The judge also dismissed with leave to amend a claim under Californias Unfair Competition Law. To advance that claim, the judge said consumers must show the three-fold damages they seek for antitrust violations do not provide an adequate remedy for the alleged misconduct.  Attorneys for the plaintiff class and energy companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday evening. Christopher Lebsock of Hausfeld LLP represents the plaintiffs. Alexander Kaplan of Susman Godfrey represents Vitol, and Jeffrey Davidson of Covington & Burling represents the SK companies.",https://www.courthousenews.com/energy-firms-cant-dodge-california-gas-price-fixing-suit/

Reuters March 30, 2021, 07:34 IST DUBAI/LONDON/MOSCOW: Saudi Arabiais prepared to support extending oil cuts by OPECand allies into May and June and is also ready to extend its own voluntary cuts to boost oil pricesamid a new wave of coronavirus lockdowns, a source briefed on the matter said on Monday. With oil prices making steady gains earlier this year, OPEC and allies, known as OPEC+, had hoped to ease output cuts. But last week four OPEC+ sources told Reuters a fresh wave of lockdowns would most likely encourage the group to extend cuts into May when it meets on Thursday. On Monday, the source said Saudi Arabia was keen to extend cuts into June. ""They don't see demand as yet strong enough and want to prevent prices from falling,"" the source said. The Saudi energy ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The cuts involve OPEC led by Saudi Arabia as well as non-OPEC producers led by Russia. Together their cuts currently stand at just over 7 million barrels per day plus an additional 1 million bpd voluntary reduction by Saudi Arabia. Last year, cuts touched a record 9.7 million bpd, or about 10% of world output. OPEC+ had already surprised the market on March 4 by deciding to hold output broadly steady. Russia and Kazakhstan were allowed to slightly raise production. A source familiar with Russia's thinking said on Monday Moscow would support extending cuts again while seeking a new small output hike for itself. Industry benchmark Brent crude futures, which this month reached their highest since before the pandemic at $71 a barrel, have since fallen to about $65. Another reason for caution is rising Iranian oil exports, which have also weighed on prices. Iran has managed to boost shipments in recent months despite U.S. sanctions.

Jim Justice has signed into law a bill that establishes a fee for modifications of well-work permits issued by the state Department of Environmental Protection to address a million-dollar Save Gov. Jim Justice has signed into law a bill that establishes a fee for modifications of well-work permits issued by the state Department of Environmental Protection to address a million-dollar shortfall currently hindering the ability of the departments Office of Oil and Gas to regulate the industry. The new lawwill establish a $2,500 fee for modifications of well-work permits. There is currently no fee for oil- or gas-well permit modification applications. Other DEP permitting programs, including mining, air and water, have fees associated with modifications. The Department of Environmental Protection estimates the permits will provide an additional $500,000 annually for the Office of Oil and Gas, based on recent averages of 200 modifications per year. That would erase some, but not all, of the Office of Oil and Gass $1.3 million shortfall. The Office of Oil and Gas is down to 10 inspectors responsible for 75,000 wells. Last year, the office resolved to eliminate 14 of about 39 positions, saving around $1.1 million. Department of Environmental Protection Deputy Secretary Scott Mandirola has said the DEP has looked at other options to raise the other roughly half of its shortfall, including a request for additional general revenue and annual fees per-well for well operators. The legislation passed the Senateas Senate Bill 404 without opposition earlier this month and was later approved by the House of Delegatesin a 77-22 vote. It will be effective 90 days from passage. An identical version of SB 404 also passed the Senate without opposition last year before stalling in the House Finance Committee. A bill originating in the Senate Energy, Industry and Mining Committee, and referred to the Senate Finance Committee last week, is designed to coverthe other $800,000 the Office of Oil and Gas would need annually just to fund its reduced workforce. The measure, as amended by Sen. Bill Ihlenfeld, D-Ohio, would impose an annual $100 oversight fee for all unplugged wells producing 10,000 cubic feet or more of gas that are not solely providing free gas to a landowner, a category of about 13,000 wells statewide that would generate the additional $800,000 per year for the Office of Oil and Gas.

425,Niwa used oil and gas money to research whales,stuff,"Mar 29, 2021",2021-03-29 16:00:00,"Niwa doesn't make moral judgments about funding sources. Council fears seismic gun effects on whale sanctuary But Niwas general manager research, Rob Murdoch, said in an interview it was tens of thousands, not hundreds of thousands of dollars, from memory. While Niwa paid for the buoys, petroleum company assistance was needed to deploy and retrieve them, as well as staff time and resources to interpret the data. The petroleum companies were not the only contributors. Others included the Department of Conservation, Marlborough District Council and some New Zealand universities. Woodside Energy paid a scholarship for a University of Auckland PhD student to participate in this and other research. It was quite a big collaborative project, said Murdoch. This funding provided by the petroleum companies resulted in excellent science which would not have been conducted otherwise, said Niwa in its written answers. But Greenpeace Aotearoa is unimpressed. We need our government science agencies to be independent  not funded by corporations with vested interests, said Amanda Larsson, a senior campaigner. Its sadly all too common that polluting companies try to buy good favour by throwing loose change at worthy causes, she said. Geoff Baird, Niwas general manager of communications and marketing., said: We don't make a moral judgment about the genesis of the funding. Prospecting for oil and gas was legal and encouraged at the time, the managers said in the interview. Niwa doesnt make policy decisions about allowing oil and gas activity, the government does. Niwa provides the best information possible for the government to manage the activities that it allows. Supplied Whale research is hard, Niwa says. Whale research is expensive and many species are hard to find, even cryptic. The ultimate outcome was that we got some extremely good and innovative science done, Murdoch said. But they did not have sufficient money to carry out the whale research and approached the petroleum companies and others for funding. Niwa hasnt co-funded any new research with oil and gas companies since 2018, and I have been given assurances that Niwa is unlikely to receive any future funding from the oil and gas sector for research, said Megan Woods in an email. She is the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation as well as the Minister of Energy and Resources. But the scientific results of the funding are still being published. Two papers were published this year and a third is pending. The buoys were deployed in 2016-17 on two occasions in and near Cook Strait. They were anchored close to the sea floor and recorded audio signals across a wide range of the acoustic spectrum. Once retrieved, the data were analysed using algorithms that separated out the known songs, calls, clicks and other sounds emitted by marine mammals. For example, in an October 2020 academic paper, scientists from Niwa and elsewhere concluded: The results presented here greatly enhance our knowledge of humpback whale movementsthrough central New Zealand, and provide information about song transmission and migration routes of western South Pacific humpback whales. In a November 2019 paper, the researchers measured the length of sperm whales using passive acoustic monitoring Yes length. An August 2019 paper reported on the foraging activities of sperm whales by season and time of day Sperm whales in Cook Strait and Kaikura waters are well studied, and some of that knowledge came from the records of commercial whalers. Niwa/Stuff A pygmy blue whale is tagged with a Niwa satellite tracker in early 2018. The effort was partially funded by oil and gas company OMV. But even these hunters probably didnt know that a blue whale could circumnavigate the South Island in about a week. That insight came from a blue whale research voyage that Niwa and others undertook in early 2018 It was funded in part by OMV, the integrated oil and gas company based in Vienna and a dominant company in the Taranaki basin. The voyage demonstrated the difficulties and cost of whale research. Over eight days at sea, interrupted by cyclone Fehi, in a chartered vessel, the researchers sighted 14 blue whales, plus a handful of other species. They got six skin or blubber samples for later study in the lab. And they attached satellite tags to two whales, probably pygmy blue whales. One moved north, but the tracker stopped working after a few days, off Northland. The second did a circumnavigation of the South Island over about a week. Niwa Niwa releases passive acoustic monitoring buoys in Cook Strait in June 2016. OMVs involvement was disclosed by Niwa. Indeed, petro company funding of the whale research was disclosed in the six peer-reviewed science articles that have been published so far. This how Stuff learned about it. A seventh paper (on the satellite-tracked pygmy blues) will be published soon. Meanwhile, terabytes of data collected by the buoys remain to be analysed, but Niwa and others do not have the resources. Some researchers have dispersed around the world and others are on to new projects, said Niwas Rob Murdoch. Petroleum company funding has dried up too. Chevron and others have left New Zealand and OMV had other interests, Murdoch said. No amount of money would be an acceptable tradeoff for turning a blind eye to activities that are driving nature and the climate towards collapse, said Greenpeaces  Amanda Larsson. That sort of thinking is at odds with the fact that our own survival is directly linked to the health of the ocean and the natural world. One of the buoys was deployed in the Ross Sea earlier this year, and it will probably be a couple of years before its data can be collected. Indirectly using oil and gas data Seismic ships dont only collect data on petroleum. They also collect data on whales and dolphins. Under NZ law, seismic ships must carry marine mammal observers, who visually scan the seas looking for cetaceans. Seismic ships also carry various acoustic monitoring devices, with operators listening for whales and dolphins. If cetaceans are detected, the seismic survey is supposed to cease until the animals are a certain distance away. Importantly, these trained observers keep records, including the likely species, the location, the weather, water depth and so forth. Katharina Peters, now a postdoctoral researcher in the Cetacean Ecology Research Group at Massey University, got the cetacean records from a seismic survey done in 2015-16 northwest of the North lsand. There were 60 cetacean reports but only 36 were considered robust enough for a peer-reviewed journal. Most of the records concerned commonly seen sperm and blues whales, but one concerned a visual sighting of five Rissos dolphins. These are incredibly rare in NZ waters, with just five confirmed sightings between 1970 and 2017 In her paper, Peters described the seismic ship as a platform of opportunity If collected under rigorous protocols and by experienced observers, such data can extend our knowledge of species occurrence and",https://www.stuff.co.nz/science/124623607/niwa-used-oil-and-gas-money-to-research-whales.html
426,Alaskans weigh in on future of oil and gas at federal forum,newsminer,"Mar 29, 2021",2021-03-29 13:00:00,"Oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters is on pause. That includes a sale in Alaskas Cook Inlet that was originally slated for later this year and is Save Oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters is on pause. That includes a sale in Alaskas Cook Inlet that was originally slated for later this year and is now suspended indefinitely. At the same time, the federal government is reviewing its energy program and gathering input from industry experts, environmental advocates and tribal leaders across the country. Several representatives from those groups, including two from Alaska, weighed in on the program at an Interior Department forum Thursday. Nicole Borromeo, executive vice president and general counsel of the Alaska Federation of Natives, said that while Alaska Native communities are on the front lines of climate change, the federation also acknowledges the oil and gas industry is a boon for the Alaska Native workers it employs. Alaska natives do not operate in an either/or space when it comes to the nations energy policy, Borromeo said. We favor both traditional and emerging forms because a combination of both best serves our state and our people. In Alaska, the National Petroleum Reserve and a large swath of Cook Inlet are both part of the federal oil and gas program. Earlier this year, the federal government halted an upcoming lease sale in the inlet in response to an executive order from the Biden administration, geared toward addressing climate change. Alaska and 12 other states are suing the Biden administration for that decision, while some environmental advocates are petitioning the government to block offshore leasing for five years. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said the government needs to take a long view at its management of public lands and waters. The pause on new oil and gas lease sales give us space to look at the federal fossil fuel programs that havent been meaningfully examined or modernized in decades, she said. Michael LeVine is a Juneau-based Arctic fellow with Ocean Conservancy, an environmental advocacy nonprofit. He said the pause was a good first step but further reforms and legislation are needed. If we could make one change in the legislation about offshore oil and gas, it would be to prioritize the health and viability of ocean ecosystems, rather than the way its stated now, a priority for extraction, LeVine said. He said offshore leasing in Alaska jeopardizes ocean ecosystems and the people who rely on them, including coastal communities and members of the fishing industry. Representatives from trade unions and oil and gas industry associations said cutting federal oil and gas production would be bad for jobs. Borromeo said AFN is also concerned about maintaining energy jobs for Alaska Native people. She said the department should actively consult Native communities in its decision-making on energy policy. Let us show you our lands, she said. Dont necessarily just rely on what private industry or environmental groups are saying. We want to be the ones to take you and to show you. She encouraged Interior Department officials to visit Alaska to see it for themselves. That means youre going to have to stay probably a week or so, she said. Because its going to take you a day to get here, a day to adjust up in Anchorage, and then weve gotta get out to the bush. We need to travel. The Interior Department said it will complete an interim report on its federal conventional energy programs this summer. Its soliciting additional feedback until April 15.

Only seven companies, including Eni, Equinor and Total, have set targets in-line with the International Energy Agencys 2-degree Celsius-aligned Sustainable Development Scenario. BIs Carbon scores help investors understand where oil and gas companies are now, where they plan to be and where they should be with respect to carbon intensity. Bloomberg Intelligence: Data-driven research Learn more Navigating CO2 transition risk in oil & gas: BI Carbon Scores Understanding carbon-transition risks and reduction strategies is a challenge because the data and commitments made take many forms. BIs new Carbon Scores bring clarity to past and future performance for 39 oil and gas companies by assessing reduction trends, intensity, planned reductions, future intensity and positioning relative to a temperature-aligned benchmark. European majors lead on BI Carbon Scores Equinor and Total earned top overall BI Carbon scores. Our analysis of 39 oil and gas companies suggests that these two have the best combination of current and forecasted carbon performance. Current performance measures reductions in operational carbon intensity  million metric tons CO2e/invested capital plus depreciation/$ billion  over the latest five-year period and existing carbon intensity. Forecasts based on publicly reported greenhouse gas-reduction strategies measure future reduction, intensity and distance from the International Energy Agencys Sustainable Development Scenario. European integrated oil peers Galp, BP and Eni also earned top scores. Indian Oil, Gazprom Neft and Oil & Natural Gas trailed, given theyve yet to set greenhouse gas emission-reduction strategies. CO2 forecast score highlights alignment with 2-degree scenario BIs Carbon Forecast score provides a relative ranking of future carbon reduction and operational carbon intensity in 2030 relative to peers and to a 2-degree Celsius-aligned benchmark. Companies, including Eni, Equinor and Total, which have set greenhouse gas-reduction targets that meet or surpass the International Energy Agencys Sustainable Development Scenario earned top scores. According to the IEAs scenario, which is aligned with limiting warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, oil and gas companies must reduce operational Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse-gas emissions intensity 44% by 2030 from 2018. Equinors goal of carbon-neutral operations by 2030 suggests it will reduce emissions by 100% from 2019-30. The Carbon Forecast score makes up 75% of the overall BI Carbon Score. Current performance score identifies leaders on CO2 intensity BIs Current Carbon Performance score brings clarity as to which oil and gas companies have reduced operational carbon intensity the most in the latest five-year period and how they stand relative to each other on current carbon intensity. Equinor, Total and Galp earned top scores, with each company reducing its intensity by more than 20% and having current carbon levels well below the peer-set average of 0.29 (million tonnes CO2e/$ billion). Chevron, which hasnt announced a comprehensive greenhouse gas-reduction strategy, scored well with the sixth-lowest current carbon intensity.

Okoronkwo said this in a Wrap-Up Address he presented at the Society Of Petroleum Engineers Oloibiri Lectore Series And Energy Forum (SPEOLEF) held at the PTDF Auditorium Abuja. The lecture which was attended by the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, the Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mr. Mele Kolo Kyari, the Director, Department of Petroleum Resources, Auwalu Sarki had as its theme: Operational Excellence and Portfolio Optimisation  Way Forward for The Oil and Gas Industry Post Covid-19. Speaking at the event, the Aiteo Group Managing Director observed that the oil and gas industry is still grappling with the aftermath of the crash in global oil price and collapse in demand which were triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. He stated, This phenomenon has accelerated new paradigms in Portfolio Optimisation and Supply Chain balance in the industry. With the price volatility, geo-political tussle between Russia and Saudi Arabia experienced during the first wave of global covid lock down, financial leadership and liquidity risk management will remain major areas of focus for upstream oil and gas companies. Digitisation and big data have also become key tools for success in the industry and will gain even more prominence in a post COVID era. He explained that the industry is not yet out of the woods, despite promising trends in price as influenced by OPEC+ production cuts. He said, The unprecedented discovery, approvals and now application of the COVID 19 vaccines, hopefully the pandemic would be contained and economies will start opening again. According to him, the lock down has demonstrated that, with increasing speed and capacity in connectivity (like 5G), digital tools are no longer just enabling communication. They are providing and indeed accelerating opportunities for value creation and value capture through enterprise integration, communication across multiple social media, remote monitoring, task automation, all to enhance operational efficiency, integrity, and process safety. READ ALSO: Ministry of Petroleum gives new date for NIPS 2021 So today, digitization is no longer an option but a fundamental requirement for companies to go leaner and to remain competitive particularly in this era of energy transition. He emphasized that successful implementation of digitization will require collaboration across multiple industry stakeholders including investors, leaders and even policy makers. Okoronkwo said, It will also require reforming existing enterprise data architecture, adoption of cloud computing, internet of things, artificial intelligence, drone technology, social media and whole lot of other emerging mobile computing and communication platforms.

As neighbours and trade partners, the U.S. is Canadas biggest customer when it comes to oil and gas services and products. Part of Bidens platform was the cancellation of Keystone XL, and a $2 trillion climate plan. the latter significantly impacting both Canada and Alberta, who invested billions. These two stances show an eye on moving from oil and gas and combatting climate change, even though in the coming decades their services will be still be required, and the U.S. is the worlds biggest buyer. This raises concerns for Canada, who is actively seeking other trade and business partners to buy their product. While Canada is the worlds fourth-largest oil producer and third in the world for proven reserves it struggles with getting its oil to other countries, while spending billions to import oil. It would be in Canadas best interest to find other business partners and larger markets quickly. A diversification of product is vital for the sector and countrys GDP. With world outlookslated to increase as the world navigates out of COVID-19, Canada could find itself in an advantageous situation. Although Canada has other customers for their oil and gas, a broader customer base provides insurance should the U.S. and Biden take further steps in their climate plan. Projects such as the Trans Mountain pipelineare of utmost importance to economic recovery and growth, increased market visibility, job creation, and safety, while in-house projects such as Energy East should be on the forefront. Trans Mountain could give Canada more overseas opportunities with a hub on the west coast, and benefit the country. Tapping into the Asian market would be monumental. While these are important projects for the country, the pipeline vs. rail debate is another issue at hand, both for the environment, safety, and cost. In November, Canadian crude-by-rail exports surged 87% to 170,000 barrels per day, with the Canada Energy Regulator stating oil shipments of 173,000 barrels per day. Rail transportation is also considered more expensive than shipping by pipeline, yet works in a pinch when left with no other choice. Even in the face of climate change and an eye on the future, oil will be refined and extracted for decades to come. During this time, its imperative that this oil makes it to people safely and cost-effectively. Pipelines are also considered more environmentally friendly, especially as the industry has innovated and transformedoperations over the years. While both methods come with their concerns (from spills to derailments), the safer and more economically viable option is pipelines. Now there just needs to be a solution that pleases all and gets Canadas product to bigger markets and diversifying its customer base.",https://boereport.com/2021/03/29/canadian-oil-and-gas-needs-to-cast-a-bigger-net/

433,Can Oil And Gas Save Europe's Poorest Country?,menafn,"Mar 29, 2021",2021-03-29 06:32:54,"Ukraine is now Europe's poorest country (per capita), having overtaken the long-time leader Moldova in 2018. A country whose abundant coal reserves have spurred its transformation into the Soviet Union's leading industrial and agricultural powerhouse has, over the course of the last 30 years, become Europe's chronically underachieving appendage. The state Tweet on Twitter (MENAFN - Baystreet.ca)  Ukraine is now Europe's poorest country (per capita), having overtaken the long-time leader Moldova in 2018. A country whose abundant coal reserves have spurred its transformation into the Soviet Union's leading industrial and agricultural powerhouse has, over the course of the last 30 years, become Europe's chronically underachieving appendage. The state of things in Ukraine's energy sector reflects that of the economy at large  outdated infrastructure, lack of long-term investment and an unwavering penchant for poor management have created a triple whammy that Kyiv has so far been unable to resolve. At the same time, its eastern neighbor Russia has tangibly contributed to the chaos and confusion and it is against the background of a still-raging conflict in Donbas that the Ukrainian authorities are trying to resuscitate their oil and gas production. Struggling with gradually declining gas production from mature fields that were discovered back in the Soviet era of the 1960-1970s, Ukraine sees its national oil and gas company Naftogaz as the conduit towards higher domestic output and, consequently, increased energy security. Traditionally, Naftogaz would control almost four-fifths of Ukrainian gas production  this is certainly true for the average of the 2010s though it needs to be noted that in 2010 Naftogaz produced 89% of Ukraine's aggregate compared to 76% in 2020. The main reason for this trend stems from the maturity of Naftogaz's producing assets, the Shebelinskoye and Krestishenskoye fields' depletion ratio had risen to 90% by the end of the decade, whilst there seem to be no new gas assets of equivalent quantity coming up in the pipeline. Keeping all the above in mind, it seems somewhat counterintuitive that Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced that by 2025 Ukraine should renounce imported gas. One would often hear from Ukrainian politicians that Ukraine has become more self-sufficient in terms of its gas needs, however, the only reason this happened is that overall consumption in Ukraine has plummeted since 2014. It is only in the past couple of years that demand bounced back into its growth phase. Total gas demand in Ukraine has increased 8% year-on-year to 32.29 BCm in 2020 while gas output has been decreasing  at first glance everything seems to indicate that such tight deadlines foreshadow a surefire failure. Government intervention has been the main underlying cause of mismanagement in the modern history of Naftogaz  the temptation of easy money flowing in from Gazprom's transit fees or the lure of murky schemes in gas import contracts was never easy to shake off. CEO Andrey Kobolev has tried to ease the government's grip on how Naftogaz revenues are allocated and now, with his mandate extended into 2024 and no more elections on the horizon, he can finally enjoy a couple of 'silent' years, focusing on the Ukrainian NOC's primary role, providing energy. Concurrently, it needs to be said that state intervention might also have a beneficial side, as was demonstrated by recent moves within Ukraine's Energy Ministry. Committed to counteract the tepid international interest towards the country's first-ever international licensing round, the government has allotted Naftogaz several promising licensing blocks. These assets might provide the reserve base for future growth. The Dolphin block is Ukraine's most promising offshore asset (the Ukrainian Black Sea is assumed to wield 150 BCm of gas), whilst the Yuzivska block is Ukraine's most promising shale play, though located relatively close to the front line in Donbas. Naftogaz is confronted with a dual dilemma with regard to these blocks. Considering most of its currently producing onshore assets are of conventional nature, it lacks shale and offshore experience and know-how, however, perhaps even more importantly it lacks the finances to kickstart its ambitious drilling campaign. The COVID-induced market slump has stymied Naftogaz's financial stature, dropping into negative territory following the profit-generating period of 2018-2019. At the same time, the Ukraine government maintains ambitious long-term goals for its largest national taxpayer: Investing 21 billion USD into exploration in the 2021-2030 timeframe, of which 7.3 billion USD in 2021-2025 Tripling the company's proven reserves base from the current level of 158 BCm to 500 BCm by 2025 Expanding into renewables, including the construction of wind farms in the Black Sea Balancing these interests, especially in the tumultuous political climate of Ukraine, is no easy feat. For instance, the average price Ukraine pays for its imported gas has started to climb back again  and although it useful for Kyiv that Gazprom has ceased to publish its prices since the summer months of 2020, the cost would still fall on Naftogaz's shoulders. Simultaneously, Naftogaz can no longer count on transit revenues boosting its financial standing. One of the key tenets of the Ukrainian NOC's transformation into a market-driven company was the spinning-off of all its transportation assets into a separate entity, Main Gas Pipelines of Ukraine (Magistralniye Gazoprovody Ukrainy, MGU). By doing so, Naftogaz has rid itself of the gargantuan task of modernizing the entire country's dilapidated gas transmission infrastructure, i.e. freeing up its balance sheet, as well as cleared one of the main geopolitical irritants of its operations  the seemingly endless Russo-Ukrainian gas dispute. On the other hand, transit revenues could have provided a temporary aid in financing Naftogaz's upstream expansion. The Ukrainian government would still garner the transit income as MGU is a state-owned entity, however, Naftogaz would be excluded from that string of transactions. This need not mean that Naftogaz's ambitious plans are destined for failure. Ukraine still has ample hydrocarbon reserves and despite talks of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, Kyiv would be fully supportive of more oil and gas production, regardless of whether it is conventional onshore, offshore, or shale. Thus, the EU/IMF-sponsored changes will at some point allow Naftogaz to become more profitable in the future, though the effect of those changes will most likely play out in a much more protracted timeframe than the Ukrainian authorities envisage. Yet if there is a time to launch a production ramp-up, it is now. Gas wars between Moscow and Kyiv are unlikely in the upcoming years thanks to the 5-year transportation contract signed in late 2019 yet the conflict potential is still there, especially as we get closer to 2024-2025.

434,"Climate Future Of Oil And Gas  Three Federal, One New Mexico Stepping Stones.",forbes,"Mar 29, 2021",2021-03-29 03:52:58,"Four independent meetings in the past week suggested changes that will affect the future of the oil and gas industry in the USA. Bidens High-Cost Plan To Accelerate U.S. Adoption Of Electric Vehicles Experts from many organizations were invited to share their views: oil and gas industry, environmental, labor, tribal. Interior Secretary, Deb Haaland, opened the forum. Now is the time for us to have a frank conversation about the future of our shared resources. She also said that fossil fuels will be around and have a major impact for years to come. During the forum, Interior officials refused to take any position on issues presented by attendees. An official of API (American Petroleum Institute) argued that oil and gas were essential to the recovery after the pandemic, and that slowing this would be a danger to national security. On the opposite side were organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and Earthworks. They wanted a ban on new federal leases for oil and gas development.  Other groups supported higher royalties they wanted paid by oil and gas companies, which had not been changed for many years, as well as stronger regulations on controlling methane emissions. Despite their stance mentioned above, API had in fact just released a document that supported carbon-pricing, funding for carbon capture and green hydrogen, and federal regulations to limit methane emissions. (2) Congress to repeal and clean up methane emissions regulation. The goal is to repeal rules installed last September to remove methane as a cause of air pollution in oil and gas operations, storage and pipeline transmission of natural gas, and leaks from aging oil and gas facilities. The proposal , introduced by Senator Martin Heinrich from New Mexico on Thursday March 25, is sensible, and support is widespread. Majors such as Shell and bp and trade groups like API have expressed support for such regulation. Final voting on the bill is anticipated in mid-May. (3) New venting and flaring regulations for New Mexico. In a press release dated March 25, 2021, entitled Oil Conservation Commission Approves EMNRDs Final Natural Gas Waste Reduction Rules, New Mexico finalizes perhaps the strongest requirements in the US for natural gas capture from oil and gas developments both upstream and midstream (e.g. pipelines and gas-processing plants). New Mexico Governor Lujan-Grisham initiated the task in a 2019 executive order on climate change. Office of the Governor The rule follows two years of research, testimony and outreach to stakeholders. The rule requires: Regular reporting of natural gas losses from upstream and midstream operations. That routine venting and flaring of natural gas be banned. An increasing gas capture target culminating in 98% by 2026. Data collection in the first phase: reliable data to identify methane losses at every stage of oil and gas development. Operators to decide what methane-control systems work best (this could lead to new jobs.) Over 50% of greenhouse gases (GHG) in New Mexico in 2018 were caused by oil and gas operations plus fuel combustion in cars and trucks, etc. Flaring and venting are not the same thing Venting is the release of methane, the dominant component of natural gas, into the atmosphere, where it has 21 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide, CO2. Flaring is the burning of natural gas as its released, and the methane burns to CO2, which is much less warming. The trade group, New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, supportsthe 98% gas capture goal even though it is ambitious. Gina McCarthy, White House national climate advisor. EPA (4) High-level meeting on carbon-pricing. Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate adviser, met virtually on Monday March 22 with heads of 10 large oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil XOM , Chevro CVX n, and Royal Dutch Shell. She apparently arranged the meetingto hear the views of an industry that had been responsible for growth in both jobs and GHG. Note: carbon-pricing is a cost applied to carbon emissions to encourage companies to reduce the amount of GHG they emit. The companies supported carbon-pricing as a way to reduce GHG emissions that cause global warming. Companies based in Europe, such as Shell, wanted to support policies that would cost them more if they emitted more GHG. But some US companies warned that if, as a consequence, they were restricted in producing oil and gas, more fossil fuels would be imported to meet demand. This could mean the US would no longer be self-sufficient in crude oil. Mike Sommers, CEO of API, the largest large oil and gas trade group, said after the meeting, We are committed to working with the White House to develop effective government policies that help meet the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and support a cleaner future. On Thursday March 25, API endorsed a carbon-pricing policy that reversed its own long-lived policy. Oil and gas companies are different from the bakery down the street. Both have carbon-footprints to address and try to reduce their own GHG emissions from burning fossil fuel. But oil and gas companies make and sell the stuff that burns to CO2, the main greenhouse gas. That puts them in the cross-hairs. Implications for glide path. New Mexico's oil production jumped by 10.5% in 2020 to an all-time high of 366 million barrels, close to 1 million barrels per day average. This is a surprise, because 2020 was the year of the pandemic and Saudi-Russian oil-price squabbles, which led to a huge oil-price drop in the spring, when many oil wells across the US were shut-in. It testifies to the inexpensive cost of producing oil in the prolific Delaware basin the premier basin in the USA and one of the best in the world. The forward-looking rules and ideas in the four stepping-stones above are related to what has been called the glide path.The current altitude is that burning fossil fuels now causes 75% of greenhouse gas emissions. The landing zone is that oil and gas will still be significant by 2050 - probably 30-50% of energy consumption.  This concept defines a gradual slowing of demand and supply for oil and gas products to meet the common goal of net-zero GHG emissions by the year 2050. A glide path transition can entail the following maneuvers: Retrain or otherwise preserve jobs of oil and gas workers. Switch to green power for all oil and gas operations. For example, drilling or pumping frac jobs. Reduce to near zero flaring of gas and leaking of methane from wells, pipelines, and facilities. New Mexico and Colorado are leading the charge here. Develop and implement carbon capture and storage in old oil and gas fields. This will be needed to contribute to the net-zero goal and it will preserve jobs. Occidental OXY is leading this effort, even capturing CO2 from the air and injecting it underground. Redirect some investments pegged for new oil and gas drilling to renewable energies.

All rights reserved) (AP)  President Joe Biden  shut down oil and gas lease salesfrom the nations vast public lands and waters in his first days in office, citing worries about climate change. Now his administration has to figure out what do with the multibillion-dollar program without crushing a significant sector of the U.S. economy  and while fending off sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and the oil industry. The leasing ban is only temporary, although officials have declined to say how long it will last. And its unclear how much legal authority the government has to stop drilling on about 23 million acres (9 million hectares) previously leased to energy companies. Ad Here are some questions hanging over Bidens Interior Department as it launches a months-long review of the governments petroleum sales with a virtual forum Thursday. WHY IS BIDEN TARGETING OIL AND GAS LEASE SALES? Burning of oil, gas and coal from government-owned lands and waters is a top source of U.S. emissions, accounting for 24% of the nations greenhouse gases. Oil and gas account for the biggest chunk of human-caused fossil fuel emissions from federal lands following a drilling surge under former President Donald Trump. Emission reductions from a permanent leasing ban would be relatively small -- about 100 million tons (91 million metric tons) annually, or less than 1% of global fossil fuel emissions, according to a study by a nonprofit research group. But environmentalists and others who want more aggressive action against climate change say a ban would nudge the economy in a new direction. Biden wants to substitute fossil fuel production and consumption with policies that promote renewable energy on public lands, such as wind and solar power. Ad The federal government is a huge player here. The government has market power, said attorney Max Sarinsky with New York University Law Schools Institute for Policy Integrity. If you restrict the supply (of oil and gas), you alter the market and you create a better environment for more sustainable fuels. Lease sales and royalties companies pay on extracted oil and gas brought in more than $83 billion in revenue over the past decade. Half the money from onshore drilling goes to the state where it occurred. Money from offshore drilling gets shared with states at a lesser rate and pays for a conservation fund used to preserve land nationwide. WHAT'S BEEN DONE SO FAR? The administration postponed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and Utah. Biden earlier had suspended leasing in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Interior officials say the fossil fuel program has failed to consider climate impacts and that irresponsible leasing practices carve up wildlife habitat, threaten Native American cultural and sacred sites and lock up public lands that could be used for recreation or conservation. Ad After what they call a fire sale of public energy reserves under Trump, Biden's team argues that companies still have plenty of undeveloped leases  almost 14 million acres (6 million hectares) in western states and more than 9 million acres (3.6 million hectares) offshore. Companies also have  about 7,700 unused drilling permits  enough for years Despite the moratorium, the Biden administration has continued to issue new permits for existing leases, including more than 200 in March, records show. Environmentalists want that to stop, but an outright drilling ban would raise thorny legal issues. Companies could claim they have the right to extract oil and gas after spending years and millions of dollars to secure leases. WHAT ARE BIDEN'S OPTIONS? A ban on new leases means drilling would fade out as existing ones expire. It would be a heavy blow for western and Gulf Coast states that heavily depend on oil and gas revenue to pay for schools, roads and other services. Ad Another option is to increase royalty fees to reflect the social cost of climate change  damage from rising seas, drought, wildfires and other global warming impacts. That would keep revenue flowing and make it more expensive to drill on federal land, forcing companies to concentrate on the most profitable reserves and reducing emissions, though by less than a ban. If its not possible to have a carbon tax on all oil and gas extraction, at least we could do something akin to that on public lands, said James Stock, a Harvard University economist and former member of the White House Council on Economic Advisers under Obama. HOW MANY JOBS COULD BE LOST? Economists say claims by industry groups and allies in Congress that a leasing ban would trigger massive job losses are greatly exaggerated. An industry-promoted University of Wyoming study projected almost 300,000 jobs lost by 2025. But historical data on energy jobs suggest a much smaller impact of about 60,000 jobs, said Jeremy Weber, former chief energy economist for Trump's White House Council of Economic Advisers and now a University of Pittsburgh associate professor Ad That's still a significant number as the U.S. economy recovers from job losses in the pandemic. And even limited job losses could profoundly affect local economies in Wyoming, New Mexico and other oil-dependent states. Theres also no guarantee such impacts would be offset by Biden's promise to deliver millions of new green energy jobs, such as installing solar panels or helping with environmental cleanups of abandoned oil wells and coal mines. Despite promises by renewable energy advocates, such jobs dont fill the bucket like oil and gas does, said Jim Willox, a commissioner in Converse County, Wyoming, the states top crude producer and home to several new wind farms. Aware of such concerns, Biden climate adviser Gina McCarthy met with executives from Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other companies Monday to discuss ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A White House statement said the administration is not fighting the oil and gas sector and wants to create jobs while addressing emissions. Ad American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said independent forecasts show natural gas and oil will provide about half of the global energy mix for decades to come. WHATS NEXT? Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, sworn in last week as the first Native American to oversee the nation's public lands and waters, will kick off Thursday's forum,which will include representatives of industry, labor, conservationist groups, Indigenous people and others.

The... AP A rig and supply vessel in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Louisiana. Thirteen states sued the Biden administration on Wednesday to end a suspension of new oil and gas leases on federal land and water, and to reschedule cancelled sales of leases in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska waters and western states. The Republican-leaning states, led by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, seek a court order ending the moratorium imposed after Democratic President Joe Biden signed executive orders on climate change on January 27. The suit specifically seeks an order that the government go ahead with a sale of oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico that had been scheduled for March 17 until it was cancelled; and a lease sale that had been planned for this year in Alaska's Cook Inlet. And it calls for other suspended lease sales to go forward. Sales also have been postponed for federal lands in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Montana, Oklahoma, Nevada and New Mexico. Biden and multiple federal agencies bypassed comment periods and other bureaucratic steps required before such delays can be undertaken, the states claim in the lawsuit, which was filed on Wednesday in the federal court's Western District of Louisiana. The lawsuit notes that coastal states receive significant revenue from onshore and offshore oil and gas activity. Stopping leases, the lawsuit argues, would diminish revenue that pays for Louisiana efforts to restore coastal wetlands, raise energy costs, and lead to major job losses in oil-producing states. Although Landry and the lawsuit's supporters said the moratorium has already driven up prices and endangered energy jobs, Bidens suspension doesnt stop companies from drilling on existing leases. But a long-term halt to oil and gas sales would curb future production and could hurt states like Louisiana that are heavily dependent on the industry. Biden's team has argued that companies still have plenty of undeveloped leases  almost 14 million acres (six million hectares) in western states and more than nine million acres (3.6 million hectares) offshore. Companies also have about 7,700 unused drilling permits  enough for years. This will not affect oil and gas production or jobs for years to come, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, when asked about the lawsuit's claims at a Wednesday briefing. Administration officials have declined to say how long the pause on lease sales will last. Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia are the other plaintiff states. Western Energy Alliance, an industry lobbying group based in Colorado, sued over the leasing suspension in federal court in Wyoming on the same day it was announced.

By Viktor Katona- Mar 27, 2021, 4:00 PM CDT Join Our Community Ukraine is now Europes poorest country (per capita), having overtaken the long-time leader Moldova in 2018. A country whose abundant coal reserves have spurred its transformation into the Soviet Unions leading industrial and agricultural powerhouse has, over the course of the last 30 years, become Europes chronically underachieving appendage. The state of things in Ukraines energy sector reflects that of the economy at large  outdated infrastructure, lack of long-term investment and an unwavering penchant for poor management have created a triple whammy that Kyiv has so far been unable to resolve. At the same time, its eastern neighbor Russia has tangibly contributed to the chaos and confusion and it is against the background of a still-raging conflict in Donbas that the Ukrainian authorities are trying to resuscitate their oil and gas production. Struggling with gradually declining gas production from mature fields that were discovered back in the Soviet era of the 1960-1970s, Ukraine sees its national oil and gas company Naftogaz as the conduit towards higher domestic output and, consequently, increased energy security. Traditionally, Naftogaz would control almost four-fifths of Ukrainian gas production  this is certainly true for the average of the 2010s though it needs to be noted that in 2010 Naftogaz produced 89% of Ukraines aggregate compared to 76% in 2020. The main reason for this trend stems from the maturity of Naftogazs producing assets, the Shebelinskoye and Krestishenskoye fields depletion ratio had risen to 90% by the end of the decade, whilst there seem to be no new gas assets of equivalent quantity coming up in the pipeline. Graph 1. Gas Production of Ukraine in Total and Naftogaz in particular in 2010-2020 (Billion cubic meters per year). Source: Ukraines Energy Ministry, Naftogaz Ukrainy. Keeping all the above in mind, it seems somewhat counterintuitive that Ukraines Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced that by 2025 Ukraine should renounce imported gas. One would often hear from Ukrainian politicians that Ukraine has become more self-sufficient in terms of its gas needs, however, the only reason this happened is that overall consumption in Ukraine has plummeted since 2014. It is only in the past couple of years that demand bounced back into its growth phase. Total gas demand in Ukraine has increased 8% year-on-year to 32.29 BCm in 2020 while gas output has been decreasing  at first glance everything seems to indicate that such tight deadlines foreshadow a surefire failure. Graph 2. Ukraines Monthly Gas Consumption in 2014-2021 (billion cubic meters per month). Source: Ukraines Finance Ministry. Government intervention has been the main underlying cause of mismanagement in the modern history of Naftogaz  the temptation of easy money flowing in from Gazproms transit fees or the lure of murky schemes in gas import contracts was never easy to shake off. CEO Andrey Kobolev has tried to ease the governments grip on how Naftogaz revenues are allocated and now, with his mandate extended into 2024 and no more elections on the horizon, he can finally enjoy a couple of silent years, focusing on the Ukrainian NOCs primary role, providing energy. Concurrently, it needs to be said that state intervention might also have a beneficial side, as was demonstrated by recent moves within Ukraines Energy Ministry. Committed to counteract the tepid international interest towards the countrys first-ever international licensing round, the government has allotted Naftogaz several promising licensing blocks. Related: Oil Sees Biggest Single-Day Loss Since April 2020 These assets might provide the reserve base for future growth. The Dolphin block is Ukraines most promising offshore asset (the Ukrainian Black Sea is assumed to wield 150 BCm of gas), whilst the Yuzivska block is Ukraines most promising shale play, though located relatively close to the front line in Donbas. Naftogaz is confronted with a dual dilemma with regard to these blocks. Considering most of its currently producing onshore assets are of conventional nature, it lacks shale and offshore experience and know-how, however, perhaps even more importantly it lacks the finances to kickstart its ambitious drilling campaign. The COVID-induced market slump has stymied Naftogazs financial stature, dropping into negative territory following the profit-generating period of 2018-2019. At the same time, the Ukraine government maintains ambitious long-term goals for its largest national taxpayer: Investing 21 billion USD into exploration in the 2021-2030 timeframe, of which 7.3 billion USD in 2021-2025 Tripling the companys proven reserves base from the current level of 158 BCm to 500 BCm by 2025 Expanding into renewables, including the construction of wind farms in the Black Sea Balancing these interests, especially in the tumultuous political climate of Ukraine, is no easy feat. For instance, the average price Ukraine pays for its imported gas has started to climb back again (see Graph 3)  and although it useful for Kyiv that Gazprom has ceased to publish its prices since the summer months of 2020, the cost would still fall on Naftogazs shoulders. Simultaneously, Naftogaz can no longer count on transit revenues boosting its financial standing. One of the key tenets of the Ukrainian NOCs transformation into a market-driven company was the spinning-off of all its transportation assets into a separate entity, Main Gas Pipelines of Ukraine (Magistralniye Gazoprovody Ukrainy, MGU). Graph 3. Average European Gazprom Gas Price vs Cost of Ukraine's Reverse Gas Purchases 2015-2021 (USD per 1000m3). Source: Ministry for Development of Economy, Trade, and Agriculture of Ukraine; Gazprom. By doing so, Naftogaz has rid itself of the gargantuan task of modernizing the entire countrys dilapidated gas transmission infrastructure, i.e. freeing up its balance sheet, as well as cleared one of the main geopolitical irritants of its operations  the seemingly endless Russo-Ukrainian gas dispute. On the other hand, transit revenues could have provided a temporary aid in financing Naftogazs upstream expansion. The Ukrainian government would still garner the transit income as MGU is a state-owned entity, however, Naftogaz would be excluded from that string of transactions. This need not mean that Naftogazs ambitious plans are destined for failure. Ukraine still has ample hydrocarbon reserves and despite talks of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, Kyiv would be fully supportive of more oil and gas production, regardless of whether it is conventional onshore, offshore, or shale. Thus, the EU/IMF-sponsored changes will at some point allow Naftogaz to become more profitable in the future, though the effect of those changes will most likely play out in a much more protracted timeframe than the Ukrainian authorities envisage.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) DALLAS (NEWS RELEASE)  The following is a news release from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas: Activity in the oil and gas sector expanded strongly in first quarter 2021, according to oil and gas executives responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey . Our latest survey results show the oil and gas industry starting 2021 on a positive note, said Michael Plante, Dallas Fed senior research economist. Business activity grew strongly, and survey respondents reported a dramatic improvement in their outlook. For the first time in two years, there were more firms reporting increased employment than job cuts.[ ] Additional key takeaways from this quarters survey: The business activity index soared from 18.5 in the fourth quarter to 53.6 in the first, reaching its highest reading in the surveys five-year history. The oil production index rose from 1.0 in the fourth quarter to 16.3 in the first quarter. Likewise, the natural gas production index turned positive and increased 18 points to 15.9. Six-month outlooks improved notably, with the index rising from 21.6 last quarter to 70.6an all-time high and a sign of improving optimism among executives. Oilfield services firms saw equipment utilization jump and margins increase, pointing to an improved operating environment. Breakeven Prices Rise Slightly special questions ,firms were asked about breakeven prices by basin, expected changes in employee headcounts for 2021, expectations for changes in service pricing this year and the impact of changing federal regulation on profitability. Breakeven prices for profitably drilling a new well averaged $52 among all respondents, up slightly from last years average of $49. As in past years, there was wide variation, with responses ranging from $20 to $100 a barrel. Higher oil prices since the start of the year mean more than half of respondents are now able to profitably drill a new well, Plante said.[ ] Additional key takeaways from this quarters special questions results: Seventy-one percent of support services executives expect the selling price of their firms primary service or product to slightly increase from December 2020 to December 2021. Slightly over half53 percentof executives expect their head count to remain unchanged from December 2020 to December 2021, while 39 percent expect an increase.

The legislation set out to give $9 million in tax relief to oil and gas companies, designed by Republican lawmakers to reduce the assessed value of oil and gas properties by the amount of federal windfall profits taxes they paid. Colorado is facing a $1.2 billion shortfall over the next decade for capital costs related directly to energy impact, Pea said. It is ironic, that in this year of public concern for the enormous costs which county governments will face due to the costs from energy development, that the first tax measure adopted by the Republican-controlled House is to give the oil and gas companies a tax break  at the expense of local governments. Pea told The Statesman that county governments were going to be in urgent need of assistance and that HB 1152 was not in the public interest. Casting some shade on the legislative branch, Pea added, Id urge the people of Colorado to question their state representatives about how they voted on the measure. Twenty Years Ago: In one of the most comprehensive polls taken on population pressures and urban sprawl, Colorado voters overwhelmingly said overpopulation and overdevelopment were deteriorating their quality of life. The poll, undertaken by Ridder/Braden Inc. on behalf of population policy organization Negative Population Growth (NPG), showed that three quarters of Coloradans believed the current trend of growth threatened natural resources and the quality of education. Colorado voters want their local communities to be empowered to discourage population growth and development, said NPG executive director Sharon Stein. The link between the concerns evident in this poll and expected population increases cannot be ignored. Over 70% of those polled named rapid population growth, overcrowding, traffic and urban sprawl as top community issues. Stein said that Coloradans saw the shepherding of lresponsible development as the domain of state and federal leaders and that public policies were needed in order to maintain a high quality of life, healthy environment and a sound economy. This survey suggests that Colorado voters would favor new controls on building and development and federal limits on immigration, Stein said. There is a striking level of public awareness and concern about population growth. Twenty Years Ago: Detractors of state Rep. Angie Paccione, D-Fort Collins, and her campaign to fill the Fourth Congressional District seat said they saw a pattern of concerning behavior emerging after she narrowly avoided ethics charges only to come under scrutiny again for emails she had blasted out to Colorado State University and University of Northern Colorado students. In one email she wrote, in part, that some of the financial aid that you and your family receive comes from the federal government. The email then went on to make the claim that U.S. Rep. Marilyn Musgrave, R-Fort Morgan, who Paccione was seeking to unseat, had voted to slash funding for student loans. Two students took exception to the apparent invasion of privacy and contacted CSU President Larry Penley, to request an official investigation. Pacciones campaign manager Gary Chandler said that the campaign had simply copied the email addresses off CSUs directory website. I could show you how to do it if you want, Chandler said. But Musgraves campaign manager, Lance Henderson, said that CSU had a clear policy stating initiating or facilitating in any way mass unsolicited and unofficial electronic mailing is against school policy. Paccione used the system to benefit her campaign, and ultimately, her own personal gain, Henderson went on.

View Comments New Mexico U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich lead a group of U.S. Senate Democrats in aiming to reinstate federal methane emission controls enacted under the administration of former-President Barack Obama but rescinded by his predecessor Donald Trump. The senators introduced a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act for Trumps rollback of the policies that weakened or eliminated requirements under the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for oil and gas companies limit emissions from operations. By passing this resolution of disapproval, Congress would be taking swift action to reinstate and strengthen responsible methane emission standards, which is critical to confronting the climate crisis and reducing the air pollution harming communities in New Mexico, Heinrich said. But even absent its consequences for climate change, methane leaks waste valuable energy resources and harm public health. More: Impact of NM's oil and gas production on economy, families discussed in Artesia roundtable During Trumps four years as President, his administration pushed an energy dominance agenda by rolling back regulations on oil and gas operations and opening more public lands such as national parks and monuments to drilling and mining. But that could change following the 2020 election as President Joe Biden enacted policies upon taking office in January to add stricter regulations on extraction and aggressively pursued initiatives aimed at mitigating pollution and climate change. Democrats in Congress appear to be following suit as the party now controls both the House and Senate. More: New Mexico enacts tougher emissions rules on oil and gas, calls for 98 percent gas capture Of Trumps energy policies, Heinrich said the former Presidents actions weakened the federal Clean Air Act, leaving little environmental protections from oil and gas emissions and other pollution sources. Methane has 80 times the global warming potential as carbon dioxide, and Heinrich argued it could be captured and sold to provide a greater return to taxpayers for fossil fuel operations on public lands. In the wake of the Trump administration, there are very few Clean Air Act protections left in place to limit emissions of dangerous methane pollution from the production, processing, transmission and storage of oil and gas in the United States, Heinrich said. When methane leaks from oil and gas wells, harmful carcinogens like benzene leak into the air alongside it. That means children are suffering more asthma attacks, and seniors are having trouble breathing. More: New Mexico Indigenous leaders criticize oil and gas industry amid Interior's federal review The resolution specifically sought to reinstate 2016 regulations known as the and Natural Gas New Source Performance Standards, and if passed would reinstate methane restrictions on production and processing segments, along with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) requirements for transmission and storage infrastructure. VOCs  gases like benzene, ethylene and glycol  result from industrial practices such as oil and gas production and create ground-level ozone when interacting with sunlight. The regulations would increase reporting requirements for operators emitting methane or VOCs, and call for more use of gas capture and low-bleed technology to reduce emissions. More: New Mexico's political leaders call for President Biden to end oil and gas restrictions Ozone pollution is of particular concern in southeast New Mexico, an area known for heavy fossil fuel production but was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department as having ozone pollution levels in exceedance of the federal National Ambient Air Quality Standard. U.S. Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who joined Heinrich in introducing the resolution said Trumps rollbacks of federal environmental regulations were detrimental to the U.S. efforts to address climate change. He said Senate Democrats were committed to undoing Trumps actions and would continue to do so. More: Deb Haaland to lead Interior amid concerns from New Mexico oil and gas industry Methane standards are one of the most important ways to address an important source of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute significantly to climate change, and the Trump administrations weakening of those standards was a dagger in the heart of efforts to address the climate crisis, Schumer said. Senate Democrats said we would fight to reverse the previous administrations illogical and devastating weakening of methane protections, and as Majority Leader, I am committing to using Congressional Review Act authority to do just that. The move was supported by environmental groups in New Mexico, as Celerah Hawes, New Mexico field organizer with Moms Clean Air Force said air pollution from oil and gas disproportionately affects minority communities and stricter regulations would protect New Mexicos vulnerable populations. More: State approves $500 million in capital projects. Oil and gas counties call for more funds In New Mexico, the areas with the most oil and gas operations are home to Latino and Indigenous communities, she said. These populations are being burdened by the harmful air pollution that is leaking, venting, and flaring at alarming rates and can cause respiratory and heart disease. Executive Director of New Mexico Interfaith Power and Light Joan Brown said methane pollution from oil and gas was concerning in New Mexico as oil and gas operations boomed in recent years but brought dire impacts to human health and the environment in oil and gas regions. Aside from enforcing tougher standards she called on the EPA to cut methane emissions from oil and gas by 65 percent from 2012 levels to make an impact on climate change. We know about methane pollution, its effects on the health of people, on climate change and we have the technical means to address it, Brown said. This step is an important ethical direction that demonstrates the commitment of supporters in the Senate to protect communities, public health and our climate to reduce methane waste and pollution from oil and gas development.

President Mnangagwa said the signing of the PEDPA, which provides the framework for rapid progression of the Muzarabani oil and gas project, would give further impetus to the accelerated attainment of the Government's US$12 billion mining industry target by 2023. ""I exhort all stakeholders to position themselves for the value chain benefits, new investments and technologies that will accrue from the exploration of oil and gas in our country,"" he said. However, he implored Invictus to protect the environment in its operations. Vice President Constantino Chiwenga said the signing of the PEDPA demonstrated that some companies in the international business community had recognised that Zimbabwe was open for business, as enunciated by President Mnangagwa . ""The signing of this agreement will help ensure that the mining sector continues to contribute to the economic development of the country, with the oil and gas sub-sector expected to contribute immensely towards the country's vision of achieving an empowered and prosperous upper middle class society by 2030,"" he said. ""This signing ceremony is testimony of the New Dispensation's commitment to transforming the livelihoods of Zimbabweans. The mining sector is one of the building blocks upon which Vision 2030 is premised. ""As we implement the National Development Strategy 1, we welcome such partnerships, not only in the mining sub-sector, but across all sectors of the economy. The exploration and development of oil and gas resources is a game-changer in making the Zimbabwe energy sector self-sufficient which is key in realising our national vision."" VP Chiwenga said Government continues to prioritise increased production and productivity across all sectors of the economy. Mines and Mining Development Minister Winston Chitando said Zimbabwe might be a producer of oil by March next year in the event of successful discovery. Reprocessed Data gathered by global oil giant, Mobil in the early 1990s, has shown encouraging evidence of the potential existence of oil and gas in Muzarabani. He said his ministry was making efforts to fulfil the target set by President Mnangagwa's new administration upon inception in 2017, to make Zimbabwe energy self-sufficient. Added Minister Chitando: ""The area in question is 100 000 hectares of land and one of the early engagements we had, as the Second Republic was to engage with Geo-Associates and Invictus to work together to ensure that we work on the development programme of this asset. ""Should these (oil/gas test) wells be successful, as we hope, Zimbabwe will, by this time next year, be a producer of oil."" Copyright The Herald.

444,"As the Shift to Green Energy Speeds Up, Shells Big Natural-Gas Bet Is at Risk",wsj,"Mar 27, 2021",2021-03-27 09:30:00,"Natural gas, long seen long seen by energy companies as a bridge between fossil fuels and renewables, faces growing environmental scrutiny and competition from cleaner energy sources. Total SE , which also invested in gas, given that gas projects typically cost billions of dollars up front and take decades to recoup that investment. Shell last month halved its outlook for global gas demand growth to 1% a year, and said demand for the fuel could peak as soon as the 2030s. While burning gas emits less greenhouse gas than coal does, environmental gains are lost if there is a leakage of methane, the main component of natural gas. Methane is more potent than carbon dioxide in contributing to climate change and has become a target of environmentalists. If you look at the global gas industry, its role in the energy transition and in the world energy mix decades from now is up for grabs,            Maarten Wetselaar,      who heads Shells gas business, said at a conference last month, adding that more action to reduce methane leakage was needed. An inspector looking for leaks at a Shell oil and gas well site in the Permian Basin in 2019. Photo: James Durbin for The Wall Street Journal Shell is using infrared cameras, lasers and satellites to detect methane leaks at production sites, during transportation and at power stations. It has also pushed for policies to reduce methane emissions from the oil-and-gas industry in the U.S. and Europe. Shell targets methane-emissions intensity below 0.2% on all its assets by 2025. Many energy companies dont have targets. The company has also started selling carbon-neutral cargoes of liquefied-natural gas, in which emissions can be offset with carbon credits, and is spending millions of dollars on projects to capture and store carbon. Shell said natural gas emits about half as many greenhouse gases and less than one-tenth of the air pollutants as coal does when it is used to generate electricity. The company added that it can still grow its gas business, with demand particularly strong in Asia, and that it will increase the fuels share of its production to 55% in the next decade, from roughly equal with oil today. However, Shell has already written down the value of some of its gas assets, including its Queensland Curtis project in Australia. The project, which it acquired in the BG deal, started in 2015 and has an expected lifespan of at least 20 years. Fossil fuels are at risk in the energy transition and natural gas could theoretically be made redundant by technological developments, but for now it is still needed, said Irene Himona, an analyst at Socit Gnrale. What matters to Shell, given its gas reserves, is what happens over the next 15 to 20 years, she added. Newsletter Sign-up Energy Alert Select breaking and enterprise stories about energy markets and businesses, through news alerts delivered to you via email. PREVIEW SUBSCRIBE Moves to curb gas are gaining traction across the West. Several U.S. cities have banned gas in new buildings, while Ireland is considering prohibiting the construction of liquefied-natural gas import terminals. France last year blocked a deal to import gas from a U.S. seller citing environmental concerns. Big corporate buyers, meanwhile, are seeking to reduce carbon emissions and asking for green, not gas, power. For example, Inc. has pledged to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Some industries that Shell and others have targeted to switch to natural gas from oil-based fuels are now also looking to move directly to lower-carbon alternatives. Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S explored liquefied-natural gas as a fuel option but was put off by methane concerns. Instead the company plans to launch the worlds first container ship running on biofuelin two years. [Liquefied-natural gas] is a fossil fuel and it emits CO2 into the atmosphere and thats the problem were trying to solve, so picking another fossil fuel as a starting point, we dont like that idea, said Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersks head of decarbonization. Maersk estimates that natural gas reduces carbon emissions from a ships chimney by around 25%, but those reductions can be offset by methane leakages in the supply chain or on the vessel. The analysis that we have seen on this are actually suggesting that even at best this solution is as bad as the problem, said Mr. Christiansen. One of Europes largest trucking companies by fleet size, Girteka Logistics UAB, has decided against expanding its small number of liquefied-natural gas trucks partly because of concerns over methane, focusing on vegetable oil instead. The decision followed",https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-the-shift-to-green-energy-speeds-up-shells-big-natural-gas-bet-is-at-risk-11616837402?mod=hp_lead_pos5
445,Debate over New Mexico oil and gas industry regulations gets national spotlight,kob,"Mar 27, 2021",2021-03-27 04:21:22,"New Mexico's oil and gas industry continues to be in the national spotlight after former congresswoman and current Interior Secretary Deb Haaland spoke during a national public forum Thursday.  ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. &mdash; New Mexico's oil and gas industry continues to be in the national spotlight after former congresswoman and current Interior Secretary Deb Haaland spoke during a national public forum Thursday. Debate rages on after the Biden administration announced in January that in order to further its goals to combat climate change, there would be no new leases given for oil and gas investment on federal land. A massive chunk of New Mexico's development is on federal land. Moving forward, Secretary Haaland will play a key role in the decision-making, as she oversees federal land in her new position. Her department's forum Thursday, which included many voices in the regulatory debate, shows the stark divide between the industry and environmental advocates. Haaland did not say how long the ban on new leases may last. &ldquo;Fossil fuels will continue to play a major role in America for years to come,&rdquo; she said during the four-hour virtual forum. &ldquo;But too often the extraction of resources has been rushed to meet the false urgency of political timetables rather than with careful consideration for the impacts of current or future generations.&rdquo; Haaland said her department will continue to gather input, and that reform is needed. She added that she believes the Trump administration ignored the negative impacts on the environment in its decision-making. It's those very effects that motivates environmental advocates like Nathalie Eddy, with Earthworks New Mexico. &ldquo;We're seeing some rays of hope and some paths towards less emissions, less pollution and harm, and ideally, ultimately, towards more renewables and a sustainable future,&quot; she said. Eddy said Haaland's involvement gives them a reason to be optimistic. &ldquo;We're really encouraged. We know where she's coming from. We know some of the concerns she shares, and how she values communities and land,&rdquo; she said. Oil and gas industry leaders said they're happy to see this conversation. &ldquo;We certainly share many of the secretary's climate goals and many of the new administration's climate goals such as reducing methane emissions, ensuring that we're working proactively to address climate change,&rdquo; said Robert McEntyre, spokesperson for New Mexico Oil &amp; Gas Association. The pandemic hit the industry hard, and the state's finances took a hit as a result. There has been a rebound from this time last year, but industry leaders want the new lease ban lifted. &ldquo;We should continue to prioritize domestic development here in the United States versus going elsewhere to other countries for our basic energy needs,&rdquo; McEntyre said. Industry leaders said they don't oppose reviewing policy&mdash;every new administration does that. Environmental advocates said the industry has made many climate promises that it hasn't kept. Earlier this month, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham sent a letter to President Biden warning him of the financial losses New Mexico could face. Some states are suing the administration over that ban on new leases. Also, Friday, New Mexico announced a regulatory change, which environmental advocates are calling a win. The state will now have one of the tightest methane emissions standards in the country, something the industry says it supports.",https://www.kob.com/new-mexico-news/debate-over-new-mexico-oil-and-gas-industry-regulations-gets-national-spotlight/6055192/?cat=504

Oil & Gas BPCL sells 54.16 per cent stake in NRL to OIL; 4.4 per cent to EIL OIL bought a 54.16 per cent stake to raise its shareholding in the refinery to 80.16 per cent, the company said in stock exchange filings. March 27, 2021, 08:32 IST New Delhi: Privatisation-bound Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd ( BPCL ) on Friday said it has sold its entire 61.5 per cent stake in Numaligarh Refineryin Assamto a consortium of OilIndia Ltd and Engineers India and Government of Assam for Rs 9,876 crore. OIL bought a 54.16 per cent stake to raise its shareholding in the refinery to 80.16 per cent, the company said in stock exchange filings. Its partner, Engineers India Ltd (EIL) bought a 4.4 per cent stake and the balance 3.2 per cent was acquired by Government of Assam. The sale of Numaligarh Refinery Ltd(NRL) clears the way for privatisation of India's second-largest fuel retailer. In keeping with the Assam Peace Accord, the government had decided to keep NRL in the public sector. As part of this, BPCL was to sell its entire 61.65 per cent stake to state-owned firms. A consortium of OIL, EIL, and Government of Assam expressed interest in buying the stake. ""A Sale Purchase Agreement has been signed on March 25, 2021 between BPCL and the consortium of OIL and EIL for sale of 43.05 crore in NRL to the consortium at a consideration of Rs 9,375.96 crore,"" BPCL said in the filing. The remaining 2.29 crore equity shares have been transferred to Government of Assam for Rs 499.99 crore. ""Post these acquisition OIL's cumulative equity shareholding in NRL (including pre-acquisition 26 per cent shareholding) is 80.16 per cent,"" the firm said in a separate filing. EIL said it paid Rs 699.99 crore for 3.21 crore shares in NRL while OIL bought 39.84 crore shares for Rs 8,675.96 crore. ""Chairman and Managing Director OIL, who is presently a nominee director of OIL on the board of the Target Company (NRL) would be designated as Chairman,"" it said. Existing directors nominated by BPCL on the board of NRL would resign and rights of BPCL to appoint directors would be extinguished, it said. BPCL sold shares in NRL at a price of Rs 217.75 per share, totalling Rs 9,875.96 crore. NRL operates a 3 million tonnes per annum oil refinery in Assam. OIL currently holds 26 per cent stake in NRL while Government of Assam has around 12.35 per cent. Post NRL sale, BPCL would be left with three refineries at Mumbai, Kochi (Kerala) and Bina (Madhya Pradesh). The government is selling its entire 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL in the nation's biggest privatisation till date. Vedanta Groupand private equity firms Apollo Global and I Squared Capital's Indian unit Think Gas have put in an expression of interest for buying the government's stake. The sale of NRL is the first step towards the disinvestment of BPCL. The government has already indicated that it expects to complete BPCL privatisation by the first half of the fiscal beginning April (2021-22). The sale is key to achieving the Rs 1.75 lakh crore disinvestment target set for 2021-22. BPCL will give the buyer ownership of around 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share. NRL is looking to expand its refining capacity from 3 million tonnes per annum to 9 million tonnes a year at an investment of Rs 22,594 crore. The project is expected to be completed by 2024. The expansion also involves setting up of crude oil pipeline from Paradip in Odisha to Numaligarh and a product pipeline from Numaligarh to Siliguri in West Bengal. In the run-up to the privatisation, BPCL last month agreed to buyout Oman Oil Company's shares in the Bina refinery project for about Rs 2,400 crore. BPCL holds a 63.68 per cent stake in Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL), which built and operates a 7.8 million tonne oil refinery at Bina. It will buy 36.62 per cent of the equity share capital from OQ S.A.0.C. (formerly known as Oman Oil Company S.A.0.C.) for Rs 2,399.26 crore. BORL was incorporated in February 1994 to build a refinery at Bina. The unit initially could turn 6 million tonnes of crude oil annually into fuel, which was subsequently raised to 7.8 million tonnes.

Oil and Gas 360 Haynes and Boone, LLP and EnerCom, Inc. have launched a new research report that tracks how oil and gas companies are responding to growing pressure to support and communicate environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies and report their progress implementing those policies. The inaugural Oil and Gas ESG Tracker analyzes ESG programs, if any, of 30 U.S.-listed middle market onshore oil and gas producers and the extent of publicly disclosed ESG policies in proxy statements filed in 2020. The report focuses on U.S. onshore producers that have a market cap of greater than $100 million and are not at risk for insolvency. The ESG Tracker will be updated periodically as Haynes and Boone and EnerCom continue to monitor mid-sized onshore oil and gas operators SEC filings and other disclosures to help the market better understand the companies evolving ESG policies and spot industry trends. Among the general trends identified in the first ESG Tracker: Significant capital is being invested in funds with an ESG focus. Institutional holders own a greater percentage of producers tracked with comprehensive ESG disclosures than those producers with limited or lacking ESG policies. More than two-thirds of the companies tracked have disclosed ESG programs in SEC filings, company websites, and investor presentations, but the scope and content of each disclosure varies significantly from company to company. ESG-focused activism continues to gain momentum in the oil and gas industry. The report also tracked trends with companies proxy statements, including: Companies are disclosing ESG highlights in the CEOs letter and/or the proxy statement summary. Companies are including qualitative, and to a lesser extent quantitative, disclosures on ESG in the proxy statement although there is a lack of consistency among quantitative environmental disclosures. Companies are disclosing that executive performance bonuses are tied to ESG metrics. Companies are disclosing details of stockholder engagement efforts relating to ESG.

Its only human to care for those we love, says an offscreen voice, and also help light their way. This is the start of a recent commercial for Chevron, which goes on to say that the company is bringing affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy to America. It is the kind of feel-good ad that has long drawn criticism from environmentalists, who argue such messaging, which they call greenwashing, may mislead viewers about the extent of their climate change commitments. Weeks after the commercial was posted on YouTube, where it has racked up more than 200,000 views, a Chevron refinery in California leaked some 600 gallons of petroleum and water mixture into the San Francisco Bay. Because of this ad and others like it, Greenpeace USA and other environmental groups filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission on March 16 that accused Chevron of consistently misrepresenting its image to appear climate-friendly and racial justice-oriented. Chevron did not comment. The FTC complaint is part of a larger movement that lately has been gaining support from some key players in the promotion of the oil and gas firms. Guy Hayward, global chief executive of Forsman & Bodenfors, an international ad agency, said its New York office has signed a pledge to no longer work for oil and gas producers, utility companies, and their lobbyists. Signing the pledge was partly symbolic: Forsman & Bodenfors has done work for the Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor and is known for its award-winning Volvo campaigns. &ldquo;Its about raising awareness in the broader creative community, he added, so it becomes a topic in the same way tobacco became a topic. And now I dont know a single person who would work on a tobacco account. Dozens of other ad agencies have signed the same pledge, which was put together by the advocacy group Fossil Free Media. The effort, which is known as Clean Creatives, is managed by Duncan Meisel, who conceded it would be difficult for ad agencies to say no to fossil fuel dollars during a pandemic. Green activists are not the only ones who have been applying pressure on ad makers. Amsterdam voted in December to investigate how to block oil and gas ads from its streets. Calls to ban such advertising or prevent fossil fuel firms from sponsoring sports teams have emerged in elsewhere, too.

Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said the government needs to take a long view at its management of public lands and waters. The pause on new oil and gas lease sales give us space to look at the federal fossil fuel programs that havent been meaningfully examined or modernized in decades, she said. Michael LeVine is a Juneau-based Arctic fellow with Ocean Conservancy, an environmental advocacy nonprofit. He said the pause was a good first step but further reforms and legislation are needed. If we could make one change in the legislation about offshore oil and gas, it would be to prioritize the health and viability of ocean ecosystems, rather than the way its stated now, a priority for extraction, LeVine said. He said offshore leasing in Alaska jeopardizes ocean ecosystems and the people who rely on them, including coastal communities and members of the fishing industry. Representatives from trade unions and oil and gas industry associations said cutting federal oil and gas production would be bad for jobs.

451,E&P Plus Analyst Corner: A Low-carbon Future for the Oil and Gas Industry,hartenergy,"Mar 26, 2021",2021-03-26 14:00:00,"Decarbonization is critical for oil and gas companies to be sustainable in a low-carbon future, but most companies are struggling to translate strategy into execution. here . Amid the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, oil and gas companies have been forced to confront a crash in energy prices, as some industries reduced production and transportation activity collapsed. Nearly three-fourths of energy executives in the EY Realizing Strategy Survey indicated that COVID-19 will impact or even cause them to pivot their organizations medium- to long-term strategy. While this crisis will hopefully be resolved in the short term, it is a prelude to a more gradual long-term reality for the sector, with a focus on decarbonization and its implications for demand. Companies continue to focus on managing cash flow, driving resilience and cutting costs to get through this period of turbulencestrategies that are useful and sustainable to survive the tumult of today but not necessarily the world of tomorrow. The energy transition to a low-carbon future has many paths, with a range of outcomes in both magnitude and timing, as examined in the EY Fueling the Future analysis. For at least the next four years, President Joe Bidens administration will likely reorient U.S. regulatory priorities around reducing carbon emissions, aligning them more with the norm in Europe and the Paris Agreement. Regulations and subsidies also will influence the electric vehicle (EV) market. EVs could achieve price parity with their gasoline-fueled counterparts within the next five years, per the EY Countdown Clock, and renewables could become the worlds largest source of electric power within the same time frame. With increased focus on climate risk and ESG issues, investors may stay on the sidelines rather than put more money in capital-intensive supply-side projects. Furthermore, the stakeholders that energy executives are beholden to are changing. A recent EY survey showed 70% of energy executives believe environmental and social-issue stakeholders to be more than or as important as shareholders (Figure 1). Clearly, decarbonization is no longer just noise from environmental activists. To address these challenges, oil and gas executives should consider the following five questions. FIGURE 1. (Source: EY Realizing Strategy Survey) What outcomes does your company want to achieve? What is the businesss primary need, beyond continued growth and relevance in a changing environment? Investor appetite? Social license to operate? A stronger brand with customers or consumers? Regulatory compliance and risk mitigation? All are likely factors, but how a company prioritizes depends on its purpose and place in the energy value chain. The energy company of the future is likely to look very different than it does today. The intended outcomes should ultimately serve as the foundation for a long-term strategy and be focused on business fundamentals such as cash flow or balance sheet strength. There should be a clear link between ESG priorities, in particular decarbonization, and how they will drive the company forward. What is your carbon exposure now and in the future? A companys carbon footprint is composed of both direct and indirect emissions and can vary from one company to another. Making estimates requires looking at a companys entire operations: location, amount of acreage, efficiency, greenhouse-gas (GHG) intensity and other factors. Understanding the full dimensions of risk is necessary to mitigate them, and theyre different across markets and subsegments of the industry. With intensity-related targets, a company should explore efficiencies such as how to capture more dry gas coming off the wellhead rather than burning it off or using less diesel and process fuel in production. Some companies can use this exercise to strategize on broader changes: an integrated company may seek to balance carbon across its portfolio through a mixture of renewables, natural gas and crude, for example, in ways that other players in the ecosystem cannot. The shifting political landscape in the U.S. creates another potential area of exposure to scrutinize: new regulatory and tax burdens on fossil fuels may be implemented alongside new incentives and subsidies for renewable energy. It remains to be seen if the carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) tax credit, 45Q, remains a viable mechanism for the incoming administration. This will allow oil and gas companies to create partnerships with power generators and other technology startups (such as direct air capture) to develop operating models for injection or utilization of CO 2 that are economic at scale. Although it poses challenges, decarbonization shouldnt be seen as an existential crisis for the oil and gas sector. What type of emissions commitment should be set and at what future dates? To address pressure from governments and investors on ESG and the long-term planning for the sector, companies should explore de-risking portfolio allocations and what targets make the most sense to build credibility in the marketwhether they are absolute or intensity-based (normalized) or both. Most companies have reduction targets for scope 1 (emissions from owned assets) and scope 2 (emissions from purchased energy). Reducing scope 3 emissions, stemming from the use of a businesss products, provide the biggest challenge for the sector. Very few upstream players, for example, have set scope 3 targets, while several supermajors have, particularly those based in Europe. Regardless, executives should measure their companys emissions and determine how to follow through and disclose on GHG intensity-related or absolute targets. Intensity-related targets are focused on efficiencies, to limit the emissions from each barrel of oil to the extent possible with smooth operations. Absolute reduction targets for emissions lead to a drop in production, which for some playersparticularly in upstreamdo not make economic sense without a drastic rethinking of strategy and diversification. What will be needed from the perspectives of data, funding and governance? ESG has evolved to become a strategic business imperative as investor expectations of ESG disclosures and communication have grown. Most investors (98%) evaluate nonfinancial performance based on corporate disclosures, with 72% saying they conduct a structured, methodical evaluation, according to the EY Climate Change and Sustainability Services survey of 298 institutional investors globally. Executives need to consider their internal controls and technology needs around data collection and reporting of sustainable information. Additionally, executives should consider how cost of capital metrics could increase as a result of either limited reporting or lack of planning around carbon intensity, as some capital providers lower their allocations to carbon-heavy projects. Understanding how investors are evaluating ESG performance will be critical for accessing capital moving forward. Whats our opportunity in the alternative energy value chain?

453,"Its time to put a price on carbon, Americas top oil and gas lobbying group says",yahoo,"Mar 26, 2021",2021-03-26 10:05:21,"The shift comes as President Joe Biden has made tackling climate change a top priority, suspending oil and gas lease sales from federal lands and waters. CL=F The oil and gas industry's top lobbying group on Thursday endorsed a federal price on carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming, a reversal of longstanding policy that comes as the Biden administration has pledged dramatic steps to address climate change. The American Petroleum Institute, whose members include [hotlink]ExxonMobil[/hotlink], [hotlink]Chevron[/hotlink] and other oil giants, announced the shift ahead of a virtual forum Thursday by the Interior Department as it launches a months-long review of the governments oil and gas sales. API also called for fast-tracking commercial deployment of long-sought technology to capture and store carbon emissions as well as federal regulation of methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas wells, after strongly resisting such regulations proposed by the Obama administration. Confronting the challenge of climate change and building a lower-carbon future will require a combination of government policies, industry initiatives and continuous innovation, API President and CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement. The reversal comes as President Joe Biden has made tackling climate change a top priority, moving in his first days in office to suspend oil and gas lease sales from federal lands and waters and cancelling the contentious Keystone XL oil sands pipeline from Canada. Biden said during the campaign he supports an enforcement mechanism that targets carbon pollution, and the White House has left open use of a carbon tax to help lower U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has spoken in favor of the idea, telling the Senate Finance Committee, We cannot solve the climate crisis without effective carbon pricing. While industry critics expressed suspicions over the sincerity of the move, Sommers emphasized that oil companies want market-based solutions such as a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade policy, rather than ""heavy-handed government regulation.'' The oil industry played a key role in the defeat of proposed cap-and-trade legislation in the Senate a decade ago, and its endorsement of a carbon price and other federal action marks a turnaround after years of opposition to federal legislation to address climate change. Story continues Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on Thursday kicked off a broad review of the governments oil and gas program that could lead to a long-term ban on leases or other steps to discourage drilling and reduce emissions. Industry representatives and Republican lawmakers have sharply criticized the leasing suspension and warn that widespread job losses are likely in energy-producing states should it become permanent. But Haaland, the nations first Native American cabinet member, said it was time to take a longer view just as her ancestors did as they farmed the same land for centuries. In order to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen our nations economy, we must manage our lands and waters and resources, not just across fiscal years, but across generations, she said. Ahead of the forum, the White House hosted a videoconference meeting Monday with industry executives, including ExxonMobil and [hotlink]Royal Dutch Shell[/hotlink]. The White House said climate adviser Gina McCarthy made clear that the administration is not fighting the oil and gas sector."" The meeting came after weeks of friction over moves the administration made to halt new oil leasing on federal lands and to review Trump administration deregulation efforts aimed at helping U.S. oil and gas producers. During a Thursday press conference, Biden pitched an emerging $3 trillion proposal to upgrade U.S. infrastructure and other needs as an opportunity to create new jobs without making global warming worse. ""We have over 100,000 (oil and gas) wells that are not capped, leaking methane. We can put as many pipefitters and miners to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells, Biden said. The White House declined comment Thursday, but the industry turnaround on carbon pricing was met with doubt among some environmentalists and scorn from congressional Republicans. Were deeply skeptical, said Joshua Axelrod, senior advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council. API has not specified what price should be put on carbon, and a tax alone would not directly address other environmental problems caused by drilling, such as groundwater contamination from fracking or air pollution from oil refineries, Axelrod said. Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, top Republican on a special House committee on climate change, said a carbon tax would increase the cost of everything from food for our families to fuel for our cars, while costing jobs and harming the economy. We need serious American solutions that are based on American innovation ... not a cop-out approach to appease the radical left, Graves said. Biden has already postponed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and western states and suspended leasing in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Interior officials say the fossil fuel program has failed to consider climate impacts and that irresponsible leasing practices carve up wildlife habitat, threaten Native American cultural and sacred sites and lock up public lands that could be used for recreation or conservation. After what they call a fire sale of public energy reserves under former President Donald Trump, Bidens team argues that companies still have plenty of undeveloped leases  almost 14 million non-producing acres in western states and more than 9 million acres offshore. Companies also have about 7,700 unused drilling permits  enough for years. Despite the moratorium on new leases, the Biden administration has continued to issue permits for existing leases, including more than 200 in March, records show. Environmentalists want that to stop, but an outright drilling ban would raise thorny legal issues. Companies could claim they have the right to extract oil and gas after spending years and millions of dollars to secure leases. Thirteen states sued the Biden administration Wednesday to end the leasing suspension. The Republican-leaning states, led by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, seek a court order ending the moratorium imposed by Biden in a Jan. 27 executive order.

456,Rivalry In The Guyana Suriname Basin,newsamericasnow,"Mar 26, 2021",2021-03-26 04:05:33,"Our four countries and the IOCs interest in the cutting-edge GSB will demand as much. The Surinamese government has eight oil blocks up for auction. By Anthony T. Bryan News Americas, NEW YORK, NY, Fri. March 26, 2021: From Trinidad and Tobago (T&T), it is about one hour flying time south to Georgetown the capital of the Republic of Guyana and another hour flying south to Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname. These two new emerging oil-rich deep-water provinces now have joined Trinidad and Venezuela which have been oil producers and exporters for 118 years. The Guyana Suriname Basin, (GSB), is the Holy Grail of new oil province discoveries. Oil energy experts predict that during 2021 there will be a major increase in offshore drilling activity in the Southern Caribbean and northern South America led by Guyana, because of recent global increases in the price of crude, and because the oil and gas companies are searching for discoveries that can be quickly monetized for higher and faster returns. ExxonMobil has found approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources offshore Guyana since 2015 and had its first oil lift in December 2019. It is expected that during 2021 the company will expand its exploration in the Canje Block and prepare for drilling in the Payara project in the Stabroek Block. Suriname also hit pay dirt following its block 52 discovery in 2020. Deep water exploration in Suriname in 2021 will be led by the International Oil Companies (IOCs) Total, Shell, and Tullow. They will begin exploration drilling in 2022. There is no announced deep water drilling in Trinidad following the failure of the BHP Broadside well to forecast commercial quantities. But there is renewed activity onshore Trinidad where Canadian oil and gas company Touchstone Exploration experienced a windfall in 2020 as a result of its drilling and the signing of a five-year supply deal last December with the National Gas Company worth between US$1.6 and US$2.2 billion. But Trinidad is facing the reality that its current deep-water and onshore wells are more natural gas than oil prone. Perhaps given the global thrust toward renewable energy, and the use of LNG as a transition fuel, that may be a blessing in disguise. At the other end of the spectrum, Venezuelas oil industry has been moribund and in a near state of collapse because of decades of bad management, politization of the industry, and international sanctions against the Maduro regime. But the government is once more trying to attract the IOCs and some other National Oil Companies (NOCs) in efforts to revive the industry. The oil in the GSB is the fluid substance that motivates Trinidad, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname to further explore and drill. It is now the Holy Grail for abundant fossil fuels. They all want a piece of the action, and actions speak louder than words. Reputedly the government of T&T is approaching the responsible global maritime jurisdiction bodies for approval to push its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to the borders of the GSB. Suriname, although it is part of the GSB, intends to move its offshore exploration closer to the lucrative Stabroek fields of Guyana. Venezuela not to be outdone, last year ordered the Venezuelan Navy to re-define the nations maritime boundaries and its EEZ. The seizure and subsequent release of 12 Guyanese fishermen and their boats by the Venezuelan navy last month, in what the Guyanese assumed were within its own national maritime boundaries, but the Venezuelans said no, served to forcibly emphasize the point. Now that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has agreed that it can hear Guyanas objections to Venezuelas claim to two-thirds of the territory of Guyana, because of dubious Treaty obligations signed almost a Century ago, several independent Caribbean island states may also have to fight legal battles to maintain their maritime sovereignty. Decolonization in the Caribbean after World War II forced Venezuela to negotiate its maritime boundaries with several neighboring states including former colonial territories. For example, Great Britain ceded the Aves rock to Venezuela, now called Isla de Aves (Bird Island) off Dominica in the Eastern Caribbean. Will Venezuela now push its territorial claims based on this almost submersible strip of land? While both new governments in Guyana and Suriname are enthusiastic about their oil and gas future, the history of their separate approaches to contract negotiations with the IOCs by their previous governments have differed greatly. But that is only the bare surface of the emerging above ground issues. Yet to follow are others such as responsibility for oil spills, local content policies, corruption in the oil sector, and climate change. Suriname has been successful in getting the parent oil and gas companies, not their subsidiaries, to take full responsibility for possible oil spills. In Guyana the operating companies have committed to cover any amount above what the local insurance covers, and the newer environmental permits for the Liza 2 and Payara fields include commitments to unlimited liability for the parent company for all costs related to oil spills or any other such incident. The president of Guyana Dr. Ali, in launching the first round of consultations on Guyanas draft Local Content policy this month, stated that the essential hallmarks of the policy must be accountability, realistic targets, opportunities for capacity building, and incentives that allow Guyanese to benefit the most from their oil wealth. He also emphasized that certain services should be reserved for Guyanese procurement. The vice president of Guyana Dr. Jagdeo also stressed that the bulk of the benefits cannot just go to the investors, and that the people of Guyana must be given ample opportunity to share in the prosperity. The new governments of both Guyana and Suriname are also trying to address the importance of accountability. Dr. Jagdeo has indicated that the government is moving to put in place a new PSC for ongoing and future negotiations, but that old deals would not be re-negotiated out of respect for the sanctity of contracts. Corruption is also on the agenda of the new administration in Suriname where in the past government administrations in all sectors dispensed political patronage and the oil industry became the primary employer of ruling party partisans. In both countries, the provisions of new local content policies should not open doors to further patronage and corruption. Finally, the major challenge. The common thread in global energy policy in the 2020s will be climate change. The challenge for finding more fossil fuels lie in global environmental opposition to big projects as in the GSB, and the growing competitiveness of alternatives like wind and solar power that are often the cheapest sources of new electricity generation and a major employer in many countries. Oil and gas will be around for several decades. But even if there is industry ability to produce sweet crude and cleaner fuels in the transition toward a lower carbon world, will fossil fuels i",https://www.newsamericasnow.com/rivalry-in-guyana-suriname-basin/

By executive fiat, Joe Biden [] Mar 25, 2021 / 09:16 PM CDT / Updated: Mar 25, 2021 / 09:16 PM CDT BATON ROUGE, La. (BRPROUD)  President Joe Bidens executive orders to tackle climate change are facing legal heat from Louisiana and 14 other states. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry filed a lawsuitWednesday to topple Bidens moratorium, which has paused new oil and gas leases on public property since January. By executive fiat, Joe Biden and his administration have single-handedly driven the price of energy up  costing the American people where it hurts most, in their pocketbooks, Landry said Wednesday morning. Bidens executive orders abandon middle-class jobs at a time when America needs them most and put our energy security in the hands of foreign countries, many of whom despise Americas greatness. Bidens Jan. 27 order to halt new leases marked the White Houses larger effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions and ween the economy off fossil fuels. Drilling on federal land contributes to nearly a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions  and billions of dollars in annual revenue. Many of the states involved in the lawsuit rely heavily on oil and gas production. The 12 other states joining Louisiana in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. (Another state, Wyoming, filed a separate lawsuit.) The world will continue to need and use oil and gas for the foreseeable future, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon said Wednesday. The question is whether it will be produced under the environmental safeguards in place on federal lands in Wyoming, or overseas without equally stringent regulations. Bidens moratorium does not stop companies from drilling oil and gas through existing leases. Oil and gas jobs arent going anywhere, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday. This will not affect job markets for the years to come. The U.S. Department of the Interior will host a virtual forum Thursday to discuss the future of its federal oil and gas leasing program.

458,"Time to diversify Texas school funding, stop relying on oil and gas",caller,"Mar 26, 2021",2021-03-26 01:05:00,"With an increasingly volatile global energy market, its critical Texas plans for decreased revenue available for public school funding. Time to diversify Texas public school funding, not rely solely on oil and gas prices Margaret Spellings and Brett Perlman Opinion contributors View Comments The Port of Corpus Christi is well known for its volume of trade, which relies significantly on petroleum-related products and can fluctuate depending on the world price of oil. So, while we track and plan for future world oil price trends to determine economic activity and jobs for the region, few Corpus Christi educators and parents may realize the connection between world oil prices and local education funding. New research connects world oil prices with Texas public school funding, and it shows clearly that billions of dollars K-12 schools rely upon to educate students could be at risk if world oil prices decline in the future. More: Texans were promised more school funding and property tax relief. Here's what they'll get. In 2019, oil and gas exploration and production activity generated $13.4 billion in public finances in Texas  about $6 billion of that for public K-12 school funding, or 20% of the $32 billion annual expenditure. The money comes from local property taxes, state severance taxes paid by energy companies, royalties generated from oil and gas production on state-owned land, and multiple other taxes and fees. While world oil prices in the daily spot market have begun to recover, this research focused on realistic, long-term scenarios of energy prices for the next 15 years. It was intended to provoke a thoughtful evaluation of what Texas should do to better insulate its economy, state government and school funding mechanisms, such as the Permanent School Fund, if world oil prices decline over the long term. The analysis examined the financial impact of four oil price scenarios on schools and other local and state budget needs. Those include oil prices consistently remain at $60 per barrel; Texas experiences either one or two boom-bust cycles in which prices fluctuate between $30 and $40 per barrel; or oil drops from $40 to $30 per barrel between now and 2036. With an increasingly volatile, global energy market that could impact the world oil prices, its critical that our state plan for these potential future scenarios. More: Why isn't Texas spending these billions of dollars on education and disaster recovery? If oil prices remain at $60 per barrel for the next 15 years, energy production is expected to generate about 1.9% more per year for public school finances through 2036. Thats slightly above the anticipated student enrollment growth each year. But under less favorable scenarios, revenue for public education would fall steeply. For example, if oil prices decline from $40 to $30, contributions to K-12 education would fall by 31%, or $1.8 billion a year, from 2019 levels. The impact will be greater in areas such as the Permian and Eagle Ford basins, where the economy relies heavily on energy production. In the aggregate, state and local governments and school districts could lose $29 billion over the 15-year period. The impact will be seen in the Texas Permanent School Fund, a $47 billion endowment designated for the benefit of public schools. Run by the State Board of Education and the General Land Office, which largely invest independently of each other, the fund makes distributions directly to school districts. It pays for things like textbooks and technology and guarantees bonds issued by local school districts. The Permanent School Fund received $1.1 billion in royalties from oil and gas activity on state-owned lands in 2019. Under three of the four world oil price scenarios studied, that would fall as much as 69% through 2036, leaving nearly $10 billion less available for investment and future distribution for public education. To put the amount at risk into context, in 2018-2019, Corpus Christi ISD received $17 million from the Available School Fund, which receives the bulk of its funding from the Permanent School Fund. This year, lawmakers have the opportunity to better prepare for these scenarios by streamlining how the Permanent School Fund is managed, generating more returns from the states rainy day fund, and diversifying the sources of K-12 funding. With so much riding on the oil and natural gas sector, Texas can help future-proof our state and local budgets by using this report and strengthening its long-term financial forecasting and planning.

459,The UK Prepares To Boost North Sea Drilling,oilprice,"Mar 25, 2021",2021-03-25 22:00:00,"The UK has announced plans to drill new wells in the North Sea in order to support the oil and gas industry and save jobs, but the announcement appears to run counter to the country's net-zero promises The U.K. has announced a Landmark Deal to drill new wells in the North Sea securing the future of U.K. oil and saving thousands of jobs while calling net-zero promises into question.  The U.K. government has approved new licenses for the drilling of more wells in the North Sea, saying their aim is compatible with the transition away from fossil fuels. The deal strives to better safeguard the British economy as well as oil industry jobs.  This comes just weeks after the Financial Times stated that in 2020 oil and gas company spending in the U.K. North Sea fell to its lowest level since 2004, spending around 3.4 billion $4.6 billion less than in 2019. Drilling activity also fell to levels not experienced since the 1970s.  While environmentalists have criticized the move, the government insists that Climate Compatibility Checkpoints will measure the national demand for oil and gas, projected production levels, the development of alternative energy technologies, as well as the sectors progress in cutting emissions to help ensure green policy targets are met.  Current targets for the sector include reducing emissions by 10 percent by 2025 and 25 percent by 2027, ultimately requiring oil companies to reduce their emissions by 50 percent by 2030. A public-private investment of 16 billion $21.8 billion is expected to achieve this goal, principally going towards hydrogen production and carbon capture technologies.  This weeks announcement goes against earlier speculation that the U.K. might follow in the footsteps of Norway and Denmark, which have banned new oil exploration licenses, to curb its North Sea production in favor of net-zero objectives and greener policies.  The U.K. government has been accused of sending mixed messages by first announcing its net-zero aims followed by promises to secure the position of the countrys oil and gas sector well into the future.  Related Worlds Newest Oil Hotspot Undeterred By Poor Drilling Results  Furthermore, many believe new plans for the oil industry are at odds with a government promise for its leadership role in the critical COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.  However, those in the oil and gas sector praise the governments decision which is expected to save 40,000 jobs. It will also provide the industry with the time needed to make the transition to a clean energy future by helping companies to decarbonize, according to the U.K. government.  During this period, the government hopes to create the right business environment to attract new industrial sectors to base themselves in the UK, develop new export opportunities for British business, and secure new high-value jobs for the long-term.  Business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng has stated, the North Sea deal sends a clear message around the world that the UK will be a nation of clean energy. In addition, the UK will not leave oil and gas workers behind in the irreversible shift away from fossil fuels.  This suggests that the U.K. is taking a step away from major E.U. powers in their pledge to reduce oil production in favor of alternative energy sources over the next decade, instead opting to make oil production cleaner.  In contrast to this announcement, the government has also vowed that from 31st March 2021 it will no longer provide support for the fossil fuel energy sector overseas. This is in line with Prime Minister Boris Johnsons commitment to end taxpayer support for fossil fuels projects overseas.  Only time will tell whether the governments promise for a clean energy transition developed hand-in-hand with the oil and gas industry will put the U.K. on track to meet its net-zero carbon aims over the next decade.

461,Ad Agencies Step Away From Oil and Gas in Echo of Cigarette Exodus,nytimes,"Mar 25, 2021",2021-03-25 15:09:31,"A queasiness has set in among some people who have made ads promoting fossil fuels. One executive likened the shift to the ad industrys move away from tobacco. March 25, 2021, 11:09 a.m. ET Its night. A little boy opens the door to his fathers room. Dad, Im scared, he says. The father carries the boy back to his bed, tucks him in and clicks on a night light. Its only human to care for those we love, says an offscreen voice, and also help light their way. This is the start of a recent commercialfor Chevron, which goes on to say that the company is bringing affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy to America. It is the kind of feel-good ad that has long drawn criticism from environmentalists, who argue that such messaging, which they call greenwashing, may mislead viewers about the extent of their climate change commitments. Weeks after the commercial was posted on YouTube, where it has racked up more than 200,000 views, a Chevron refinery in California leaked some 600 gallonsof petroleum and water mixture into the San Francisco Bay. Because of this ad and others like it, Greenpeace USA and other environmental groups filed a complaintwith the Federal Trade Commission on March 16 that accused Chevron of consistently misrepresenting its image to appear climate-friendly and racial justice-oriented, while its business operations overwhelmingly rely on climate-polluting fossil fuels, which disproportionately harm communities of color. Chevron did not comment on the complaint and did not respond when asked who had created the ad and a similar commercial featuring laughing babies and dancing senior citizens that came out this month The F.T.C. complaint is part of a larger movement that lately has been gaining support from some key players in the promotion of the oil and gas companies: the people who create their ads and shape their public relations messages. Guy Hayward, the global chief executive of Forsman & Bodenfors, an international ad agency with major offices in Sweden and New York, said in an interview that the companys New York office signed a pledgethis month to no longer work for oil and gas producers, as well as utility companies and their lobbyists. The decision is a moral one, Mr. Hayward said. We believe that communication is powerful and, obviously, we should be using it to drive the change we want to see, rather than maintaining the status quo. Signing the pledge was partly symbolic: Forsman & Bodenfors has done work for the Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinorand is known for its award-winning Volvocampaigns. The point of signing it, Mr. Hayward said, is just to get the ball rolling. He added that he expected the companys other offices, in eight cities around the world, to follow the example of the New York team, calling the decision a no-brainer. Image A Statoil (now Equinor) spot, produced by Forsman & Bodenfors, features an unattended gas station being attacked by a person in a rabbit costume with a chain saw. Credit... Equinor Its about raising awareness in the broader creative community, he added, so it becomes a topic in the same way tobacco became a topic. And now I dont know a single person who would work on a tobacco account. Dozens of other ad agencies, most of them small, have signed the same pledge which was put together by the advocacy group Fossil Free Media The effort, which is known as Clean Creatives, is managed by Duncan Meisel, an environmental activist who conceded that it would be difficult for ad agencies to say no to fossil fuel dollars during a pandemic. The advertising industry is not super healthy right now, Mr. Meisel said. People are used to having these clients, and its hard to say no to a paycheck. Environmental activists are not the only ones who have been applying pressure on ad makers. Amsterdam voted in December to investigate how to block oil and gas adsfrom its streets. Other calls to ban such advertising, attach climate warningsto it, or prevent fossil fuel companies from sponsoring sports teamshave emerged in Australia Netherlands Canada France Belgium Finlandand elsewhere. Democratic officials have filed lawsuits over the past 18 months in Connecticut Delaware Massachusetts Minnesota Washington, D.C. and Hoboken N.J., accusing Exxon, the trade group American Petroleum Institute and others in the industry of engaging in deception about climate change, including through their ads. Several publications have limited or stopped accepting fossil fuel ads, including the British Medical Journal The Guardian, and the Swedish publications Dagens Nyheterand Dagens ETC The New York Times said in a statement that it did not allow oil and gas companies to sponsor its climate newsletter, its climate summit or its podcast The Daily. It still publishes paid posts from companies such as Exxon. In a statement, The Times said that advertising helps support our newsroom, which covers the issue and impacts of climate change more than any other in the U.S. Hillary Moglen, a principal at Rally, a Los Angeles advocacy communications firm that has avoided working with oil and gas companies, said a shift was underway. Its an old-guard, new-guard situation, she said. There will be a point when it wont be culturally acceptable to work with these clients. But it will be tricky for advertising and communications firms to make a clean break. BP, ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Shell help drive the marketing business, having spent nearly $3.6 billion on advertising since 1986, according to a reportlast year led by Robert Brulle, a visiting professor of environment and society at Brown University. Ms. Moglen acknowledged that firms like hers may find themselves in gray areas as fossil fuel companies invest more in clean energy businesses A little over a year ago, she said, Rally debated whether to bid on a project involving an energy efficiency company that was funded by an oil and gas giant. The firm went ahead with a bid  only to lose out. I imagine that in the future well be in that situation again, Ms. Moglen said. There are ways that those lines can be murky. So far, the efforts to resist fossil fuel dollars have been largely limited to smaller ad companies, often in Europe. Some of the biggest ad companies  Omnicom Interpublic and Dentsu  had no comment for this article. Another large one, WPP said in a statement that in all of our work with clients, we apply rigorous standards to the content we produce for them, and seek to fairly represent the environmental commitments they are making and actions they are taking. Ad executives say that some employees, especially younger ones who are increasingly sympathetic to environmental concerns, have objected to working on oil and gas accounts. Gosia Plewako, the managing director of the North America arm of Futerra, an ad agency and consulting firm with its own climate-focused pledge falls into that category. She said she worked for more than 15 years at the ad and public relations company Ogilvy before leaving in 2019. While there, she said, she was on the account for BP, which had rebranded itself as Beyond Petroleum.

The 13-state coalition argued that President Joe Bidens Jan. 27executive orderbanning new oil and gas leases on federal lands was unlawful, according to thelawsuitfiled Wednesday afternoon in U.S. District Court for lawsuit filed Wednesday afternoon in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry announced the lawsuit alongside state lawmakers and energy officials. By executive fiat, Joe Biden and his administration have single-handedly driven the price of energy up  costing the American people where it hurts most, in their pocketbooks, Landry said during a press conference Wednesday. Bidens Executive Orders abandon middle-class jobs at a time when America needs them most and put our energy security in the hands of foreign countries, many of whom despise Americas greatness. Bidens executive order violated both the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Mineral Leasing Act, which affirm Congress intent to use U.S. resources to achieve energy independence, the lawsuit alleged. The leasing ban forces the U.S. to be more dependent on foreign energy sources. For decades, Congress has embraced responsible development of our natural resources as a means of achieving energy independence  a matter of national security, Landry said. They have discarded vulnerable dependence on foreign oil, which is why the court should reject the Biden Ban. While the purpose of Bidens executive action is to fight climate change, the action amounts to a massive divestment of environmental protection projects, according to Landry. Bidens executive order will ultimately devastate communities that rely on federal oil and gas leases, the lawsuit stated. Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia were listed as plaintiffs on the suit Wednesday. Days before he signed the executive order, Biden directed the Department of Interior to pause existing oil and natural gas leases on public lands and offshore waters.

Biden started off his presidency with several executive orders directly impacting the industry by: Rachel Wagoner, Farm and Dairy Posted: Mar 25, 2021 / 07:40 AM EDT / Mar 25, 2021 / 07:40 AM EDT Courtesy of Adobe Stock Farm and Dairy )  The Biden administration is presenting some challenges for the oil and gas industry. President Joe Biden started off his presidency with several executive orders directly impacting the industry. First was the cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which was to send oil from western Canada to Nebraska. That certainly sent a chill through the industry, said David Callahan, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition. 1 report, 4 theories: Scientists mull clues on virus origin President Donald Trumps administration was seen as quite friendly to oil and gas, rolling back a number of environmental regulations in an effort to boost domestic production. The industry that employs tens of thousands of people in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia must now figure out how to proceed. The Biden administrations actions around oil and gas development, the environment and the climate have created a lot of uncertainty, industry leaders say. All that uncertainty drives changes, said Mike Chadsey, public relations director with the Ohio Oil and Gas Association. It can impact a lot of different things. Thats not what our folks are looking for. Theyre looking for regulatory, certainty. Executive action fallout Construction on the 1,200-mile Keystone XL pipeline, owned by Canadian company TC Energy Corp., began in April 2020. TC Energy said it was laying off more than 1,000 construction workers as a result of the pipeline cancellation. The company is based in Calgary, but it also owns and manages thousands of miles of natural gas pipeline in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost joined 20 other attorneys general March 18 in suing Biden and members of his administration for revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. Next, came the moratorium on new oil and gas development on federal lands. While people may not think of Ohio and Pennsylvania when thinking about public lands, there are national forests in both states. In addition to Bidens moratorium, a federal judge recently for new fracking and leasing activity to be put on hold in Ohios Wayne National Forest until a review can be done on the environmental impacts of the practice. Other impacts In addition to actions on the Keystone XL pipeline and federal lands, Biden rejoined the Paris Climate Accord after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the international agreement. Biden set a target to make the U.S. carbon neutral by 2050. The president also ordered the review of many Trump-era decisions to rollback or revise environmental regulations, including Waters of the U.S., methane emissions from oil and gas facilities and the Endangered Species Act. Andrew Casper, director of legal and regulatory affairs for Ohio Oil and Gas Association, wrote about some of these regulatory changes in the groups monthly magazine, The Drill Bit. He said they are continuing to monitor the possible changes and working to stave off or help mitigate regulatory impacts to Ohios oil and gas industry. The industry, of course, believes natural gas has a place in the clean energy transition as it burns relatively compared with other fossil fuels. The big problem, environmental groups argue, is the process to get it out of the ground, particularly fracking. A recent report completed by the Ohio River Valley Institute also found that the Appalachian fracking boom didnt deliver on its promise of economic prosperity for local residents. Local officials and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association pushed back on the reports claims, saying the data was cherry picked to fit a narrative. The thing is, when drilling is stopped, temporarily or permanently, it doesnt just hurt the workers on the well pad, Chadsey toldFarm and Dairy. Theres this big long logistics supply chain. You start turning off the wells  there are all the people downstream that that impacts, he said. There have been other actions in the region that have put a big question mark over frackings future. Fracking was permanently banned in Pennsylvanias Delaware River basin last month. The Delaware River basin covers a 13,000 square-mile area in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware, but the ban impacted Pennsylvanias northeastern Marcellus Shale gas fields the most. Callahan said in a statement at the time that the vote by the Delaware River Basin Commission defied common sense, sound science and is a grave blow to constitutionally protected property rights. Bright spots All the while, drilling has continued in the region. Though it slowed significantly last spring, when the pandemic began, it picked back up in the latter half of the year. Annual natural gas production nationwide was down by 1% in 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, but production in Appalachia actually increased . Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia produced 33.6 billion cubic feet per day in 2020, an increase over 2019 production of 32.1 billion cubic feet per day. The average rig count this month in Ohio is 8, according to data from Baker Hughes, an oil field service company. In Pennsylvania, the average rig count is at 19. Thats the lowest rig count in Pennsylvania in a decade, but the Marcellus Shale Coalition said its not as dire as it seems. Drilling is more efficient, there are longer laterals and more frack stages. Through the challenges, there are a few things to look forward to. As more people get vaccinated and things begin opening up more, people will travel. Thats more people on airplanes, on the road, Chadsey said. Were encouraged. Another bright spot is Shells ethane cracker plant, being built in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. The Beaver County Times reported March 16 the plant is expected to be completed next year. The facility is in early stages of commissioning and start-up activities. There are thousands of construction workers building the plant, which is expected to support about 600 permanent jobs once complete. Callahan toldFarm and Dairythat the coalition is eager to see the start-up of the cracker plant, not only for the jobs it will create directly, but the ones it could create downstream. The plant is expected to produce 1.6 million tons of polyethylene plastic each year, which can be used in many other products. There are already some manufacturers that use polyethylene in the area, Callahan said. You could have others that move operations closer to the source. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

465,What impact will the AfCFTA have on the oil and gas industry? (By Shantel Mufandaidza),einpresswire,"Mar 25, 2021",2021-03-25 11:40:15,"By Shantel Mufandaidza Created by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement in 2018, the African Continental Free Trade Area (""AfCFTA"") came into effect on 1 There were 915 press releases posted in the last 24 hours and 216,912 in the last 365 days. What impact will the AfCFTA have on the oil and gas industry? (By Shantel Mufandaidza) News Provided By March 25, 2021, 14:30 GMT Share This Article By Shantel Mufandaidza Created by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement in 2018, the African Continental Free Trade Area (""AfCFTA"") came into effect on 1 January 2021. Since the World Trade Organization creation, the AfCFTA is the largest free trade area globally, with 54 out of 55 nations of the African Union, many of which have already ratified the agreement. Estimations forecast that this free trade area will positively impact Africa's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), resulting in welfare gains for citizens, facilitate trade growth, and improve Africa's trade deficit. While Africa has substantial natural resources, it has not received significant benefits from the extraction and export of such resources, particularly in oil & gas. Will AfCFTA have an impact on oil & gas industry exports? Oil and gas and mineral resources account for more than 75% of Africa's exports, and the continent's potential for growth in oil & gas is significant. Estimations at the end of 2017 indicated that Africa has 487.7 tcf of proven gas reserves (7.1% of proven global reserves), while Africa's proven oil reserves are in the region of 125 billion bbl [1]. While this is the case, countries, unfortunately, do not benefit from their resources. For example, while Nigeria is a large exporter of crude oil, domestic benefits are minimal. The citizens still stay in questionable conditions plagued by limited electricity supply and unemployment. Further, the estimated average of 22 hours without electricity per month means lost sales revenues of up to 10% or more for a large proportion of Africa's businesses. Africa's oil & gas resources can help accelerate growth on the continent if used strategically. With the AfCFTA in effect, intra-Africa trading will become much easier and benefit African countries more than it has in the past. Trade barriers such as high import tariffs have left many African countries vulnerable to the international market, which resells our resources at higher prices. The AfCFTA will potentially curb this, as oil & gas producing countries will benefit from global markets and the domestic market. Focusing more on growing intracontinental oil and gas trade will give countries autonomy to govern their international trade agreements, which have often left African countries on the losing end. Analysis indicates that the AfCFTA will make room for the generation of GDPs that can positively impact African economies', create employment, and impact infrastructural development. While this is a necessary benefit that will positively impact Africa, it is already a continent plagued by corruption, which has resulted in the delayed development of essential infrastructure required to facilitate the ease of trade through the AfCFTA. For example, Angola is the largest exporter of gas on the continent and stands to benefit much from the domestic supply of gas to neighboring countries; however, the rampant corruption in Angola has hurt the necessary infrastructure necessary for the country to supply its neighbors with gas. The only way the AfCFTA would positively impact the oil and gas industry is by promoting significant investments in roads, ports, and other physical infrastructure. African governments must be serious about financing the regional infrastructure and investment needed to make AfCFTA a game-changer. They need to mobilize the continent's financial resources without increasing the risk of debt distress. While there is no universal formula for industrialization, African countries need to tailor-make their economic development strategy and industrial policy that fits their unique circumstances. Africa suffers from an energy deficit which is unfortunate for a continent that is so rich in resources. Africa's problem lies in the inability to utilize these resources for domestic benefit, and the hope is that the AfCFTA helps achieve this goal. To attain such regional socio-economic development, governments need to have a strong commitment to tackle corruption and make firm commitments to developing their own countries to ensure the booming trade and supply of oil and gas. If the continent pivots from an extractive exportation structure with oil and gas, it can secure more sustainable and inclusive trade that is not dependent on the fluctuation of commodity prices on the international market. The continent has countries rich in oil and gas and the capacity to have a firm footing on the sector with the assistance of the AfCFTA and more favorable trading terms intra-regionally. Nigeria has already set its intentions on becoming the largest oil refining hub on the continent, while Angola hopes to export gas to its neighboring countries. The AfCFTA will facilitate trade and the evolution of existing commerce lines within Africa and not necessarily radically revolutionize the space. However, in sectors like oil & gas, where corruption is rampant, this evolution will be crucially determined by transformations of existing governance structures and infrastructure. For as long as corruption is a continuing practice, the gains from domestically trading our natural resources might not be as significant as they could be. Furthermore, the AfCFTA will trigger substantial investment in the oil and gas industry from countries overseas such as the United States and other European countries, mainly because the AfCFTA changes investors' value proposition by providing a larger market with lower risk. Firstly, the AfCFTA expands the market by providing a single market with reduced cross-border barriers; investors can thus undertake larger revenue projects on a regional scale rather than a national scale. Before AfCFTA, approximately 25% of all intra-African exports in 2017 were for oil, gas, and electrical energy. With the effectiveness of the AfCFTA, the economies of scale are available for regional power solutions, Africa can reasonably expect the power export market to expand markedly. The anticipated prospect of regional power solutions is already attracting increased investment in African power projects, which would have been unfeasible before AfCFTA. For instance, Botswana and Namibia are developing a substantial 5000MW solar project to provide and trade power with 12 neighbouring countries, supported in part by Power Africa and other World Economic Forum members. This heavyweight project will create investment opportunities for every aspect of goods and services along the program's value chain. In this respect, the AfCFTA will provide a protocol for the reasonable resolution of investor-state disputes. This protocol should make the investment with African countries, particularly in capital-intensive oil and power projects, less risky for the investors and African countries.

Further supporting energy markets, a record jump in European factory output helped offset weakening near-term outlook on the region as a resurgence in coronavirus cases triggers shutdown measures. Additionally, a giant container ship was stuck, blocking the Suez Canal, limiting traffic in one of the worlds most important waterways and disrupting oil supply through the region. The Suez Canal is frequently used to transport crude from the worlds top exporters in the Middle East to European markets. A 400-meter, or 1,300-foot, long container ship, the Ever Given, was wedged lengthways across the canal on Tuesday. The impact on the oil market will be fleeting, Kevin Solomon, analyst at brokerage StoneX Group, told Bloomberg of the Suez Canal blockage. At $70 the futures market had risen too quickly, but with oil at $60 it is an opportunity to buy at much more attractive levels. Crude oil prices have weakened in the past two weeks due to softening physical demand and unwinding long positions, but some traders saw the pullback as a short-term trend that helps the energy market consolidate gains in recent months.

Jointly controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke and Britain 's BP, Aker BP was set up in 2016 to focus on oil and gas exploration and production from Norway's continental shelf. The Eni licence, known as P2511, is located on the maritime border between Norway and Britain, where Aker BP already operates several discoveries in the Alvheim areaon the Norwegian side.

Eni will remain operator of the British licence. Aker BP declined to provide a valuation for the Eni transaction. In January, Aker BP Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik told Reuters the company could expand its business to include investment outside Norway if it came across competitive opportunities. The company had looked at some offshore assets put up for sale by Brazil 's Petrobras, but decided not to bid, he added.

468,The Best Trades to Profit on the Oil and Gas Recovery,moneymorning,"Mar 25, 2021",2021-03-25 09:00:20,"Today, our Andrew Keene's going to show you the best trades to make to profit on the oil and gas recovery... Andrew Keene The word ""supercycle"" has been coming up in headlines more and more lately, particularly when it comes to crude oil. A supercycle is like an extended, mega-bullish run that can take years to run its course. The profits can blow the doors off; the last big oil supercycle, for instance, started in the early 2000s and ran until the summer of 2008. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEArca: XLE ), which is a decent benchmark for the performance of the oil and gas sectors, notched around 300% gains at the time. When you get down to the nitty gritty and look at gains in specific oil and gas stocks, the profits were even bigger, and people who used options to boost those gains absolutely cleaned up. So, now that we're hearing increasing chatter  including from several big banks  about another supercycle, coupled with signs of a big, powerful expansion of the economy well, it's got my attention. Only nowadays, we've got maybe 20 million brand-new investors who've come in from the sidelines, who've never seen firsthand how a supercycle acts. I've got you covered. And if you've been through a supercycle or two before, stick with me; I'm going to walk you through everything, make my predictions, and best of all, name some stocks to buy and trade to cash in on what's coming around the corner Conditions Are Very Bullish for Energy It wasn't even a year ago that front-month crude oil futures contracts fell through the floor into negative territory. The price for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May delivery fell to -$37.63 a barrel. You literally couldn't give the stuff away. 90 MINUTES: In the time it takes to watch a movie, you could be setting yourself up to add thousands to your portfolio. Here's how Of course, the world economy was still very much on the terrifying downhill slope of the pandemic at that point; there was no end in sight. Back then, if you'd tried to tell people that by April 2021, we'd have a handful of effective vaccines already in hundreds of millions of arms, with crude oil trading in the mid-$60s, the S&P 500 this close to 4,000, and a GDP print well north of 6% expected this year, you'd be laughed out of the room  not that anyone felt much like laughing. But 11 months later, here we are The truth is, the economy, commodities  especially oil  cyclicals, and so forth, have all been showing signs of strong recovery since around the third quarter of 2020, give or take. And lately, with so much capital rotating out of the pandemic stocks and into recovery stocks and commodities, at a time when big social and technological changes, like electric vehicles, for one, are reshaping the economy, it's easy to think that we're on the cusp of something massive. What's more, lots of well-respected analysts have made the case for an oil and commodities supercycle over the past two or three months. Big banks like Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs have all increasingly boosted their economic outlooks and, right alongside them, their commodities forecasts. They're all pointing in the direction of a supercycle. And most of these folks make a pretty convincing argument. With all that said, there's a bucket of cold water out there  a big one: The International Energy Agency. It's announced, contrary to what the banks, analysts, and talking heads have said, it's not expecting a classic supercycle. In fact, the IEA has said it's not even expecting an ""extended period on which prices rise well above the long-term trend."" In simpler terms, it's saying, yes, we're in for a bullish run of some kind, but not necessarily a supercycle. INCOME HACK: This could be your shot to collect an extra $1,000 to $5,000 a week, regardless of how volatile the markets are. Learn more Why the less-than-thrilling outlook? The IEA claims the supply of oil out there on the market and in reserve is adequate to meet even the growing demand we'll see for at least the next year; the hallmark of a supercycle is a situation where demand absolutely swamps supply. The IEA right now is forecasting a growth in demand of around 5.4 million barrels per day throughout 2021. It says demand should hit 96.4 million barrels a day by the end of this year. As of today, global output is 93.6 million barrels per day, and the producers aren't going full tilt yet. The IEA expects producers will be able to make up for whatever supply shortfalls there may be this year. And of course, it's in producers' best interests to keep supply just shy of demand. Is that bullish? Most definitely. Is that supercycle fuel? I'm afraid I have to agree with the IEA and say, ""Not quite."" There's just no denying the supply out there. But at the end of the day, we should absolutely be preparing for a bullish run, particularly in oil, which is consolidating right now. With some help from my S.C.A.N. algorithm, banking big gains from a strong oil bull could be a piece of cake How to Profit from a Not-Quite-Supercycle One of the really cool things about S.C.A.N. is its ability to zero in on the kinds of unusual options activity that can come before massive moves in stocks; it's like being a fly on the wall in a room full of the ""smart money.""

The industry has faced growing pressure by investors to measure its contribution to climate change. And the Biden administration has vowed to put the U.S. on a path toward net-zero emissions by 2050. While Democrats are still working on the details of the upcoming infrastructure proposal, it's expected to cost between $2 trillion and $3 trillion and include $400 billion in funding for clean energy and innovation. A carbon tax could also produce funding to help pay for the infrastructure plan. The Tax Foundation estimates that a tax on carbon emissions at a rate of $50 per metric ton, with an annual growth rate of 5%, could generate $1.87 trillion in additional federal revenue over 10 years. The API said it would not support a tax that would fund other programs. ""To the extent that a new carbon tax would be put into place to fund X program ... that's not what we're talking about, and that's not what we would support,"" Sommers said. He added that the industry envisions changes to existing regulations following a carbon price policy endorsement. Some environmental groups see it as an industry ploy to offer a solution to the carbon problem and stay engaged in the debate. David Doniger, climate and clean energy program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move reminds him of the maxim that it's better to be at the table than on the menu. ""This is an effort to get to the table, rather than be overlooked and run roughshod, but it's not very definite yet. I don't know what they're offering to really support,"" Doniger said. The NRDC also said it opposes removing strong pollution or efficiency regulations in exchange for a price on carbon. ""That's like the old Wimpy with the hamburgers: I'll gladly have a hamburger today and pay you back next Tuesday,"" Doniger said.

The Republican-leaning states, led by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, seek a court order ending the moratorium imposed after Democratic President Joe Biden signed executive orders on climate change on Jan. 27. The suit specifically seeks an order that the government go ahead with a sale of oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico that had been scheduled for March 17 until it was canceled; and a lease sale that had been planned for this year in Alaska's Cook Inlet. And it calls for other suspended lease sales to go forward. Sales also have been postponed for federal lands in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Montana, Oklahoma, Nevada and New Mexico. Biden and multiple federal agencies bypassed comment periods and other bureaucratic steps required before such delays can be undertaken, the states claim in the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in the federal court's Western District of Louisiana. The lawsuit notes that coastal states receive significant revenue from onshore and offshore oil and gas activity. Stopping leases, the lawsuit argues, would diminish revenue that pays for Louisiana efforts to restore coastal wetlands, raise energy costs and lead to major job losses in oil producing states. At a news conference, Landry accused the Biden administration of ""effectively banning oil and gas activity that supports businesses, employees our workers and, also, as importantly, funds our coastal restoration projects."" Although Landry and the lawsuit's supporters said the moratorium has already driven up prices and endangered energy jobs, Biden's suspension doesn't stop companies from drilling on existing leases. But a long-term halt to oil and gas sales would curb future production and could hurt states like Louisiana that are heavily dependent on the industry. Biden's team has argued that companies still have plenty of undeveloped leases  almost 14 million acres (6 million hectares) in western states and more than 9 million acres (3.6 million hectares) offshore. Companies also have about 7,700 unused drilling permits  enough for years. ""This will not affect oil and gas production or jobs for years to come,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said when asked about the lawsuit's claims at a Wednesday briefing. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, is urging the White House to reconsider the moratorium, but he also pointed to the stockpiled undeveloped leases to suggest the economic threat isn't imminent. He said the Biden administration has started to issue permits for those stockpiled leases. ""Just as you're starting to have the communications get you to a point where you're feeling better about things and the permits are being issued probably isn't the best time to file litigation,"" Edwards said. Biden administration officials have declined to say how long the pause on lease sales will last. Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia are the other plaintiff states. Western Energy Alliance, an industry lobbying group based in Colorado, sued over the leasing suspension in federal court in Wyoming on the same day it was announced. The Biden administration had not responded to the complaint as of Wednesday. The Interior Department is hosting a livestreamed forum on the leasing program Thursday as it considers changes that could affect future sales and how much companies pay for oil and gas they extract. A report outlining initial findings and the next steps in the review is due this summer. Associated Press reporters Matthew Daly in Washington, Melinda Deslatte in Baton Rouge and Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this report.",https://www.thedailycitizen.com/states-sue-to-undo-biden-pause-on-u-s-oil-and-gas-lease-sales/article_2e9b79e8-6a43-5ccf-90b0-4786471d6b2d.html

Fourteen US states including Louisiana and Wyoming filed lawsuits against President Joe Biden's administration, challenging his pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters. The legal actions, which seek to restore regular federal drilling auctions, came a day before the administration is set to launch a review of the oil and gas leasing program. Biden, a Democrat, in January signed an executive order putting on hold new leasing pending that review. During his election campaign, he pledged to end new federal leasing as part of a sweeping plan to address climate change. The pause has triggered heavy criticism from the oil industry and producing states that receive half of the revenues generated from federal lands drilling within their borders. ""We believe that the president's actions are illegal and unlawful, and we're going to hold him accountable for them to try to make sure that the gains that we've made over the years to help protect domestic oil and gas and energy continue,"" Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said in an interview. A coalition of 13 states filed one lawsuit in federal court in Louisiana, while Wyoming filed its own lawsuit in federal court in that state. The states joining Louisiana's lawsuit included Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. All have Republican attorneys general. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards is a Democrat. The lawsuits allege the administration's leasing pause violates the Mineral Leasing Act that requires quarterly lease sales. In its lawsuit, Wyoming said the administration was also required to conduct an environmental review of the leasing suspension under the National Environmental Policy Act before taking action. ""The real consequences of the action are far from certain and far from uniformly environmentally friendly,"" Wyoming said in its complaint. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, responding to a question about the lawsuits, said the Trump administration had ""flooded the oil markets with cheap federal leases. This will not affect oil and gas markets for years to come."" The Department of Interior, which oversees the federal leasing program, declined to comment.

""The first drawdown from project financing is expected in April 2021,"" OIL said in a stock exchange filing. Led by French energy giant Total, the project envisages producing 12.88 million tonnes per annum of LNG from gas discovered in Area-1, offshore Mozambique. ""Oil India Ltd (OIL), the national oil company of India, announces that Mozambique Rovuma Offshore Area-l Project has satisfied all the conditions precedent for the first debt drawdown of the project financing,"" it said. The project financing was finalised in July last year. ""The senior debt financing of USD 14.9 billion comprises export credit agencies direct loans, ECA covered facilities, commercial bank facilities and a loan facility with the African Development Bank,"" it said. Indian firms hold a total of 30 per cent stake in Area-1, which has around 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas resource. The consortium operating Area-1 had approved the final investment decision (FID) on June 18, 2019. The total cost is estimated at USD 24.1 billion and is to be funded through a combination of debt (USD 15.8 billion), equity (USD 7.4 billion) and cash flow from operations (USD 0.8 billion). Of the debt part, USD 14.9 billion is through senior debt financing. This financing comprises a loan facility with the African Development Bank, loans from commercial banks and credit from other financing institutions. The project entails designing, building and operating an integrated liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, including offshore extraction, underwater pipeline, onshore processing plant, as well as ancillary support facilities. It will have a capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per annum of LNG and will source gas from the Golfinho-Atum (GA) field within Area-1, which is located 40 kms off the coast of Mozambique. The project will supply gas for LNG exports (mainly to Europe and Asia) and domestic consumption.

Oil & Gas Africa can play central role in India's oil diversification, says Dharmendra Pradhan Africa's share of India's oil imports is about 15 per cent, or about 34 million tonnes of oil last year, Pradhan said. India's imports of gas from Africa are also gradually increasing Reuters March 25, 2021, 07:59 IST African nations could play a central role in efforts by India to diversify its sources of oiland gas, India's oil minister said on Wednesday, as the nation strives to reduce its energy reliance on the Middle East. India, the world's third biggest oil importer, has asked state refiners to speed up the diversification of oil imports to gradually cut their dependence on the Middle East after OPEC+ decided earlier this month to largely continue production cuts in April. ""As India seeks to further diversify sourcing of crude oil and LNG Africa has a central role - largely due to its proximity and absence of any choke points in trans-shipments,"" Dharmendra Pradhantold an industry summit. India imports over 80 per cent of its oil and has a huge oil import bill. Africa's share of India's oil imports is about 15 per cent, or about 34 million tonnes of oil last year, Pradhan said. India's imports of gas from Africa are also gradually increasing. India traditionally buys oil from Nigeria, Angola, Algeria, Egypt and Equatorial Guinea. In recent years it has bought oil from Cameroon, Chad, Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire also, Pradhan said. ""Therefore, we would naturally be seeking commercial partners in Africa to meet India's growing energy needs through imports of crude oil, LNG and other petroleum and energy products"". State-run Indian companies have invested $8 billion in oil and gas assets in various African nations. India, the third largest refiner in the world, is a major exporter of refined fuels. Africa is the second-largest destination for Indian refined fuels, Pradhan said, adding rising demand for technology, fuels, skills and investment in some African nations offers India opportunities for equity investment and two way tie-ups.

476,New Mexico Indigenous leaders criticize oil and gas industry in forum,currentargus,"Mar 25, 2021",2021-03-25 02:15:00,"Tribal groups from New Mexico voiced their concerns for the impact of oil and gas production during a forum held by the Interior Department. View Comments Tribal communities from New Mexico and across the nation labeled the federal governments past oil and gas polices as ""environmental racism"" amid a lack of consultation with Indigenous groups in decisions that could be devastating to sacred lands. The arguments came at the opening of a Thursday forum held by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) on its ongoing review of the federal fossil fuel program amid a temporary halt of new oil and gas leases enacted via executive order by President Biden. Environmental groups also expressed concerns alongside the Tribal groups during the forum for pollution brought on by fossil fuel development in both the northwest San Juan Basin and the southeast Permian Basin region. More: Ahead of Interior's oil and gas leasing forum, enviros dispute industry impact claims Julia Bernal, director of the Pueblo Action Alliance based in Albuquerque said the federal government should prioritize a shift away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy to protect the environment and public health in the state. The extractive economy in New Mexico will only provide short-term revenue with long-term damage to our lands and waters, and the health of our communities, she said. The Department of Interior must create a roadmap to a just transition to renewable energy and it starts with undoing the inequitable and unhealthy federal oil and gas leasing program. The Greater Chaco Coalition, a collection of more than 200 indigenous community leaders and other groups, reported more than 90 percent of the Greater Chaco Region  an area of northwest New Mexico known for heavy oil and gas development alongside lands sacred to the Navajo Nation  was already leased to oil and gas and subjected to pollution. More: New Mexico's political leaders call for President Biden to end oil and gas restrictions Federal land management decision making, the coalition argued, should see increased involvement with Native American communities when their lands could be affected. Due to unchecked oil and gas, Indigenous peoples and Greater Chaco communities are saddled with countless public health and environmental justice impacts including some of the worst air quality in the nation and a hovering methane cloud the size of Delaware, the coalition said in a statement. For justice in Greater Chaco and beyond, the federal oil and gas leasing program must be fundamentally reformed. More: Deb Haaland to lead Interior amid concerns from New Mexico oil and gas industry Interior prioritizes addressing pollution from oil and gas Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, formerly U.S. representative for New Mexicos First Congressional District and herself a Native American of the Laguna Pueblo, contended that while oil and gas was and will continue to be an important part of the U.S. economy, the federal government must reevaluate its system for allowing production on public land. She said the previous administration under former-President Donald Trump, which pursued an American energy dominance agenda by increasing leasing and seeking to open more lands to drilling, ignored the impacts to public health and pollution. More: State approves $500 million in capital projects. Oil and gas counties call for more funds Fossil fuels will continue to play a major role in America for years to come, but too often, the extraction of resources has been rushed to meet the false urgency of political timetables, rather than with careful consideration of the impacts to the environment and future generations of Americans, Haaland said in her opening comments. The potential impacts to people, water, wildlife, and climate were deliberately ignored  something the courts continue to address. The halt on new federal leases, Haaland said, will allow the Interior Department to reevaluate the impacts of fossil fuels. More: Biden's review of oil and gas leasing moves forward amid concern from New Mexico leaders She contended the oil and gas industry already held thousands of permits on 38 million acres of public land that were not affected by the halt. The pause in new oil and gas lease sales gives us space to look at the federal fossil fuel programs that havent been meaningfully examined or modernized in decades, Haaland said. I want to be clear that the pause on these lease sales does not impact permitting and development on valid existing leases."" More: New Mexico oil and gas emissions grew in 2020, study says, while spills declined Laura Daniel-Davis, principal deputy assistant secretary of lands and minerals development at the DOI said the Department was tasked with managing and preserving natural resources for the future while also working to ensure federal land usage is more beneficial to the American public. Federal oil and gas programs contribute to about a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, she said, while the royalty rate for federal leases of 12.5 percent was created in 1920. Daniel-Davis said the Department believed there were ways the program could be updated to be more beneficial. More: Oil and gas influence blamed for environmental bills blocked in New Mexico Senate An interim report was expected this summer, she said, including input from states, industry, and other stakeholder groups. Our principal charge is to manage our lands, waters and natural resources, not just across the fiscal years but across generations. Were facing serious challenges on shore with fossil fuels contributions to climate change, she said. We think there are many ways the fossil fuel program can better meet the needs of our people. More: Lujan Grisham joins state leaders voicing concerns for Biden's halt on oil and gas leases As of Jan. 31, 2021, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which manages federal onshore oil and gas development, reported 7,607 applications to permit drilling (APDs) were approved and available for use while another 5,328 were awaiting approval. The number of APDs approved by the BLM rose every year since 2016, records show, from less than 2,000 in 2016 up to about 5,000 in 2019. Nada Culver, deputy director at the BLM said that while fossil fuels makes up a large portion of the $3.46 billion in revenue brought in by the agency in Fiscal Year 2020, the energy sector should not prioritized over all others. More: While energy development is one of the land uses, it is not elevated above other uses, she said. Currently, most lands that are not legally required to be closed to oil and gas are open to leasing. Oil and gas industry defends its efforts to address climate change Frank Macchiarolo with the American Petroleum Institute argued the oil and gas industry has worked for years to develop methods to mitigate its impact on pollution and that any effort to reduce production in the U.S. would lead to increased reliance on foreign sources of fossil fuels developed with less environmental protections. Policies aimed at slowing or stopping oil and gas production also pose a threat to our national security.

477,"Joe Biden, citing climate change, halted oil and gas sales. What now?",usatoday,"Mar 25, 2021",2021-03-25 00:17:10,"Thirteen Republican-leaning states sued the Biden administration Wednesday to end a suspension of new oil and gas leases on federal land and water. The Biden administration, citing climate change, halted oil and gas lease sales in January. Now, what? Matthew Brown and Matthew Daly | Associated Press Hide Caption Biden: 'Can't wait any longer' on climate crisis President Joe Biden signed executive orders Wednesday undertaking what could be the most ambitious effort yet to cut Americas oil, gas and coal emissions while looking to create jobs and stave off the worst effects of climate change. (Jan. 27) AP BILLINGS, Mont.  President Joe Bidenshut down oil and gas lease sales from the nation's vast public lands and waters in his first days in office, citing worries about climate change. Now his administration has to figure out what do with the multibillion-dollar program without crushing a significant sector of the U.S. economy  and while fending off sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and the oil industry. The leasing ban is only temporary, although officials have declined to say how long it will last. And it's unclear how much legal authority the government has to stop drilling on about 23 million acres previously leased to energy companies. Thirteen Republican-leaning states sued the Biden administration Wednesday to end a suspension of new oil and gas leases on federal land and water and to reschedule canceled sales of leases in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska waters and Western states. Here are some questions hanging over Biden's Interior Department as it launches a months-long review of the government's petroleum sales with a virtual forum Thursday. Why targetoil and gas lease sales? Burning of oil, gas and coal from government-owned lands and waters is a top source of U.S. emissions, accounting for 24% of the nation's greenhouse gases. Oil and gas account for the biggest chunk of human-caused fossil fuel emissions from federal lands following a drilling surge under former President Donald Trump. Emission reductions from a permanent leasing ban would be relatively small  about 100 million tons (91 million metric tons) annually, or less than 1% of global fossil fuel emissions, according to a study by a nonprofit research group. But environmentalists and others who want more aggressive action against climate change say a ban would nudge the economy in a new direction. Biden wants to substitute fossil fuel production and consumption with policies that promote renewable energy on public lands, such as wind and solar power. ""The federal government is a huge player here. The government has market power,"" said attorney Max Sarinsky with New York University Law School's Institute for Policy Integrity. ""If you restrict the supply (of oil and gas), you alter the market and you create a better environment for more sustainable fuels."" Lease sales and royalties companies pay on extracted oil and gas brought in more than $83 billion in revenue over the past decade. Half the money from onshore drilling goes to the state where it occurred. Money from offshore drilling gets shared with states at a lesser rate and pays for a conservation fund used to preserve land nationwide. What's happened so far? The administration postponed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and Utah. Biden earlier had suspended leasing in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Interior officials say the fossil fuel program has failed to consider climate impacts and that irresponsible leasing practices carve up wildlife habitat, threaten Native American cultural and sacred sites and lock up public lands that could be used for recreation or conservation. Climate Point: on climate, energy and the environment your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news After what they call a ""fire sale"" of public energy reserves under Trump, Biden's team argues that companies still have plenty of undeveloped leases  almost 14 million acresin Western states and more than 9 million acresoffshore. Companies also have about 7,700 unused drilling permits  enough for years. Despite the moratorium, the Biden administration has continued to issue new permits for existing leases, including more than 200 in March, records show. Environmentalists want that to stop, but an outright drilling ban would raise thorny legal issues. Companies could claim they have the right to extract oil and gas after spending years and millions of dollars to secure leases. What are Biden's options? A ban on new leases means drilling would fade out as existing ones expire. It would be a heavy blow for western and Gulf Coast states that heavily depend on oil and gas revenue to pay for schools, roads and other services. Another option is to increase royalty fees to reflect the ""social cost"" of climate changedamage from rising seas, drought, wildfires and other global warming impacts. That would keep revenue flowing and make it more expensive to drill on federal land, forcing companies to concentrate on the most profitable reserves and reducing emissions, though by less than a ban. ""If it's not possible to have a carbon tax on all oil and gas extraction, at least we could do something akin to that on public lands,"" said James Stock, a Harvard University economist and former member of the White House Council on Economic Advisers under Obama. How many jobs could be lost? Economists say claims by industry groups and allies in Congress that a leasing ban would trigger massive job losses are greatly exaggerated. An industry-promoted University of Wyoming study projected almost 300,000 jobs lost by 2025. But historical data on energy jobs suggest a much smaller impact of about 60,000 jobs, said Jeremy Weber, former chief energy economist for Trump's White House Council of Economic Advisers and now a University of Pittsburgh associate professor. Opinion: Biden's climate change orders take a sledgehammer to Western state economie s That's still a significant number as the U.S. economy recovers from job losses in the pandemic. And even limited job losses could profoundly affect local economies in Wyoming, New Mexico and other oil-dependent states. There's also no guarantee such impacts would be offset by Biden's promise to deliver millions of new green energy jobs, such as installing solar panels or helping with environmental cleanups of abandoned oil wells and coal mines. Despite promises by renewable energy advocates, such jobs ""don't fill the bucket like oil and gas does,"" said Jim Willox, a commissioner in Converse County, Wyoming, the state's top crude producer and home to several new wind farms. Aware of such concerns, Biden climate adviser Gina McCarthy met with executives from Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other companies Monday to discuss ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A White House statement said the administration ""is not fighting the oil and gas sector"" and wants to create jobs while addressing emissions. American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said independent forecasts show natural gas and oil will provide about half of the global energy mix for decades to come.

Excerpt: You are a woman involved in various prominent leadership roles, what will you say is your most significant observation as a leader? I would say that leadership is about the commitment to serve people, with and through people. It is a commitment to creating value and impacting lives in your spheres of influence. I have seen various types of leaders and leadership styles, but for me, leadership is propelled from the inward recognition of the privilege that it is to hold any form of influence in and over the life of a fellow human being; and a commitment to then steward that influence honourably, positively, and productively. I have observed that people can see through leadership that comes from an authentic place of service, leadership that is vested in the wellbeing of the led. I have seen that people will follow and stay loyal to these kinds of leaders, and in turn very likely become the same kind of leaders. The leaders who succeed over the long term are those who never lose their awe for the magnitude of the assignments they carry, who never allow pride or complacency distort their vision and appreciation for the positions they occupy. I have also observed that leadership is more effective when the leaders are open to ideas that are at variance from theirs, and who are willing to allow their people the opportunity to succeed or fail without blame, while trying out their own ideas. I think this is especially critical for many of us who are entrepreneurs, and especially those of us who are in owner-managed firms. We need to lead in ways that ensure our people are building capacity to be able to operate without us, whilst remaining loyal to the organization because they can see they are valued, and their best interests are well represented.

The oil and gas data monetization market has two methods of monetization viz., direct and indirect. By component, the market is segmented as data-as-a-service, professional services, and platform/software. Data-as-a-service segment covers data exchange/transaction for direct monetary benefits. Platform/software and professional services represent indirect data monetization. The oil and gas data monetization market is also segmented based on upstream oil companies into National Oil Companies (NOCs), Independent Oil Companies (IOCs), National Data Repository (NDR), and oil and gas service companies. National Oil Companies (NOCs) segment is majorly driven by indirect data monetization and is anticipated to dominate the global oil and gas data monetization market over the forecast period. NOCs are increasingly spending on software/platforms and services, thus accounting for the maximum share in the data monetization market. Further, by application, the market is segmented into upstream (conventional, unconventional), midstream, and downstream. It is anticipated that the upstream application segment will continue to dominate the market over the forecast period. Upstream application segment is also classified by E&P lifecycle into exploration, development, and production segments. Exploration segment is expected to expand over the forecast period driven mainly by increasing adoption of software and solutions in deep-water exploration and shale gas exploration activities.The increasing demand for data products such as seismic survey data, geophysical data, and magnetic survey data is also driving the exploration segment in the data monetization market. Looking for exclusive market insights from business experts? Request a Custom Report Regional segmentation of the oil and gas data monetization market includes North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, South America, and Middle East & Africa (MEA).

Slideshow ( 3 images ) NEW YORK (Reuters) - The industry group representing oil and gas companies including Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp said Thursday that it supports a carbon price as one measure to mitigate climate change risk. Oil and gas trade group the American Petroleum Institute (API) said in a call with reporters that it endorsed a carbon-price policy to drive economy-wide solutions. We are not advocating a specific price, API President Mike Sommers said on the call announcing the groups new plan to address the risks of climate change. What we are saying is this is a framework through which API will advocate for specific principals. The API plans to advocate for sensible legislation that prices carbon across all economic sectors while avoiding regulatory duplication, Sommers said. API has started to shift some of its rhetoric on climate and carbon issue as the climate-focused Biden administration came to power. Still, Sommers did not commit to the industry reaching net-zero oil emissions in the next 15 years. There is no way that it is feasible without technologies that are not in the marketplace today, he said. President Joe Bidens administration is due to unveil a new economy-wide emissions reduction target for 2030 to comply with the Paris climate agreement by April 22, when Biden convenes world leaders on climate change.

488,"Alaska, 12 other states sue Biden administration over suspension of new oil and gas leases",ktoo,"Mar 25, 2021",2021-03-25 01:05:10,"The lawsuit comes about two months after Democratic President Joe Biden hit pause on any new leases for oil and gas development on federal lands and waters including Alaskas Cook Inlet and National Petroleum Reserve. hig314 ) Alaska and a dozen other Republican-leaning states are taking the Biden administration to court over its suspension of new federal oil and gas leases. The states filed the lawsuit Wednesday, led by Louisianas attorney general. It comes about two months after Democratic President Joe Biden hit pause on any new leases for oil and gas development on federal lands and waters including Alaskas Cook Inlet and National Petroleum Reserve. The move was part of a series of executive orders Biden signed soon after taking office, to address global warming. Cori Mills, an attorney with the Alaska Department of Law, argues the suspension isnt in line with federal laws. She said Alaska joined the lawsuit because oil and gas development is critical for the state. We still see most of our revenues, most of our economy, our jobs, are based on oil and gas development, responsible and environmentally conscious oil and gas development, Mills said. And we feel thats really important and vital to the state. And this lawsuit seeks to really, you know, tell the Biden administration this isnt okay. While the majority of Alaskas oil production is currently on state lands, some industry leaders say the future is in federal lands. The Department of the Interior declined to comment on the lawsuit Wednesday. The Biden administration has said its reviewing the current leasing program but has not said how long the suspension will last. The administration has also highlighted that oil and gas companies hold leases to millions of acres that have yet to be developed. And, the suspension does not stop work on those existing leases. Todays lawsuit asks the court to order the Biden administration to end the suspension, and to move forward with lease sales, including in Alaskas Cook Inlet. Meanwhile, conservation and some Indigenous groups are petitioning the Interior Department to block offshore leasing for five years, citing concerns about climate change and threats to coastal communities. Other states joining Alaska in the lawsuit include Alabama, Texas and West Virginia. Also, Wyoming filed a separate but similar lawsuit Wednesday.

490,Opinion: Federal government should take a lesson from states in oil and gas leasing policies,denverpost,"Apr 03, 2021",2021-04-03 12:21:56,"The current pause on new oil and gas leasing offers the opportunity to turn these resources into a larger source of federal funds, while better protecting the local environment and helping to confront climate change. Submit to Stumbleupon (Opens in new window) Image courtesy CU-Boulder Federal officials have postponed an oil and gas lease sale set for March 25 that includes sites near Chimney Rock National Monument. By Thomas Covertand Ryan Kellogg| Guest Commentary April 3, 2021 at 6:21 a.m. The U.S. federal government owns vast acreage of resource-rich public lands; $25 billion of oil and gas was produced from federal lands in 2019 alone. But thanks to decades of stagnant policies, these resources are being all but given away to oil and gas companies, to the detriment of taxpayers and the environment. The current pause on new oil and gas leasing offers the opportunity to turn these resources into a larger source of federal funds, while better protecting the local environment and helping to confront climate change. Improving federal leasing policies doesnt require novel policy ideas. The government can generate benefits for taxpayers and the environment simply by following practices that private landowners and major oil and gas producing states have pursued for years: high royalty rates, short lease lengths, high minimum bids, and strong bonding requirements. Private landowners capture a high share of production revenue by demanding royalty rates that are often as high as 25%. These robust royalties help landowners earn fair value for their oil and gas, even when they are dealing with a sophisticated firm that knows more about the resource size than they do. Private landowners also demand that the work gets done quickly, giving firms 3 to 5 years to either start producing or surrender their drilling rights. Individual states closely follow the private market. Texas sets royalties of 20 to 25% and lease lengths of 3 to 5 years on Texas state land. The lowest royalties used in Louisiana, New Mexico, and North Dakota are 20%, 18.75%, and 16.67%, respectively. None of these states awards leases with terms longer than 5 years. Being the largest landowner in the United States, one would think the federal government would follow similar successful practices. It doesnt. The royalty rate on federal leases is only 12.5%, and firms that sign federal leases get 10 years to develop them. These shortcomings are compounded by the fact that firms dont need to pay much up-front to get this sweetheart deal. The minimum up-front purchase bonus to get a federal oil and gas lease via auction is just $2 per acre. In Texas lease auctions, minimum bids are often as much as $5,000 per acre. To make matters worse, firms can avoid even the $2 per acre payment by not bidding at all and then paying a small fee to obtain a lease through a non-competitive award process. As a result, firms with little interest in drilling can easily speculate on federal leases with no up-front expenditure. No wonder that 53% of all federal onshore leased acreage is not producing. The federal government already has the authority to require higher royalties and to increase the minimum bid in its auctions. Reducing lease lengths from 10 years to no more than 5 and eliminating the non-competitive leasing program would, however, require amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act. Congress should act to pass such legislation. Current federal lands policies also expose Americans to environmental harm and cleanup costs. Modern shale wells cost more than $24,000 each to properly plug and abandon. But the government only requires that firms post a single $25,000 bond to cover decommissioning of all of their wells on federal lands in each state in which they operate. Firms can then easily avoid their decommissioning liability by transferring depleted wells to poorly capitalized firms. When these firms become insolvent, the wells are orphaned and pose an ongoing environmental threat until public funds are spent to permanently plug them.

LABUAN, April 3  Nearly 1,000 workers in the Rancha-Rancha oil and gas industrial zone here have undergone Covid-19 tests, following the emergence of the Pulau Enoe cluster on March 31, said Labuan Health Department director Dr Ismuni Bohari. He said the cluster was well controlled and was expected to be stable in the next two to three days. This cluster has 17 cases so far, and it is showing a downward trend. We hope the curve will be flattened the next few days, he told Bernama today. Labuan, which was about to be declared a green zone following a significant drop in positive cases since February, was redesignated a red zone on Wednesday after a spike in cases the last few days left the island with 53 active cases as of yesterday. Dr Ismuni said sub-zone four had recorded the most number of cases with 20, followed by sub-zone one with 19, sub zone two and three with six each, and sub-zone five with two. Sub-zone four has recorded the highest Covid-19 daily infectivity rate (Rt). Therefore, those people in this area should control their movements and continue with the standard operating procedure (SOP) in their daily activities, he said. The number of Covid-19 cases surpassed 40 in a span of 14 days, and the redeclaration of red zone was made after the emergence of the Pulau Enoe cluster, he said. Dr Ismuni said the authorities were closely monitoring the Jalan Kemajuan cluster, which has recorded 20 cases so far, involving an eatery and ship crews with infections up to the third generation. He also said 10 new local infections were recorded yesterday, with four cases from the game of petanque, five cases from two majlis tahlil ceremonies, and one case from a childcare centre.

492,Suez Canal must upgrade quickly to avoid future disruption,oilandgas360,"Apr 03, 2021",2021-04-03 02:00:48,"The latest oil and gas news, dedicated to all things oil and gas: people, technologies, transactions, trends, and macro-economic analysis that impact commodity prices. Reuters CAIRO  Egypts Suez Canal must move quickly to upgrade its technical infrastructure if it is to avoid future shipping disruption, shipping industry sources said, as the major trade route tries to bounce back from a costly six-day closure. International supply chains were thrown into disarray on March 23 when the 400-metre-long (430-yard) container ship Ever Given ran aground in the canal, with specialist rescue teams taking almost a week to free her after extensive dredging and repeated tugging operations. Egypt will get two new tugboats, one next week and one in August, Suez Canal Authority (SCA) chairman Osama Rabie said after the ship was finally freed, as well as taking the biggest dredger in the Middle East and arranging for a further five new Chinese tugboats. But shipping industry sources said specialist equipment and associated procedures have long struggled to keep up with the ever increasing size of commercial vessels. The average size of most vessels has increased exponentially over the last 15 years. The ability to salvage these bigger ships has not, said Peter Townsend, a marine insurance industry veteran. The issue is getting containers off essentially a 20-storey high building at sea. Michael Kingston, an international shipping specialist and an adviser to the United Nations International Maritime Organization, flagged such problems in 2013, three years before the MSC Fabiola container ship ran aground, also blocking traffic for days. The obvious way to lighten a vessel  is to take the containers off. They had no way of doing it. No equipment was readily available, he said of the Ever Given incident. LESSONS LEARNED The SCA says the canal can safely take vessels of the Ever Givens size  with a maximum capacity of 20,000 TEU (20-foot containers)  even in rough weather. As well as bigger tugboats, dredgers and offloaders, stricter guidelines on how ships transit the canal are needed, the industry sources said. Those could include using tugs to assist large vessels, or only permitting transit during daylight hours. Of course, there are many lessons learned from the (Ever Given) incident. Of course we have the capabilities, the SCAs Rabie said. Visiting the canal this week, Egypts President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said: We have to give a strong message to the world that the Suez Canal  can transport world trade at this rate or more. t was not clear yet if the Canal would opt to extend a second channel south of the one that Egypt opened in 2015 at a cost of $8 billion along a 70-km portion of the waterway. Such an extension would allow traffic to continue flowing even if a ship were grounded. An expansion for the southern section of the canal can be under consideration, said Sisi. Its up to the technical people. We dont want to take measures just due to extraordinary situations.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/suez-canal-must-upgrade-quickly-to-avoid-future-disruption-shipping-sources/

India is likely to witness an operational commencement of 647 oil and gas projects during 2021 to 2025, accounting for 33% of the total upcoming project starts across the value chain in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. 	 	GlobalDatas report, Asia Pacific Oil and Gas Projects Outlook to 2025 - Development Stage, Capacity, Capex and Contractor Details of All New Build and Expansion Projects, reveals that out of 647 projects to commence operations by 2025, upstream projects would be 80, midstream would be at 123, refinery at 85, and petrochemicals would be the highest with 359 projects. 	 	Soorya Tejomoortula, Oil & Gas Analyst at GlobalData, comments: India is one of the largest consumers and importers of oil and gas in the world due to its economic growth. Though India is taking steps to increase oil and gas production, the focus is more on the development of midstream, refineries and petrochemicals infrastructure for greater imports, processing, transport and storage. 	 	Downstream (refineries) and petrochemical projects together constitute about 69% of all upcoming oil and gas projects in India during 2021 to 2025. The 180 thousand barrels per day (mbd) capacity Barmer refinery is one of the key projects with a total cost of $4.5 billion. The project is presently under the construction stage and is expected to start operations in 2025. 	 	In petrochemicals projects, the Haldia Petrochemicals Balasore Xylene Plant (SBR) Plant is one of the key projects with a capacity of 1.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and costing $1.9 billion. The project has already received approval and is expected to start operations in 2024. 	 	GlobalData notes that midstream projects would constitute around 19% of all oil and gas projects starts in India during the period 2021 to 2025. In midstream sector, pipeline segment alone constitutes 47% of all projects followed by oil storage and LNG with 36% and 14% respectively. In pipelines, the focus is on development of natural gas pipelines with JagdishpurHaldia Phase II being one of the key projects with a length of 1,900 km and costing $1.4 billion. The pipeline is presently in construction stage and is expected to start operations in 2022. 	 	In the oil storage segment, Chandikhol strategic petroleum reserves project is a key development with a capacity of 30 million barrels (mmbbl) and a project cost of $941 million. The project has received approval and is expected to start operations in 2025. Among upcoming LNG import terminals, Karwar Floating is a key development with a capacity of 365 billion cubic feet (bcf) and a project cost of $573 million. 	 	In the upstream (fields) segment, Cluster IIA is a key production project, which would start operations in 2021 with a total production capacity of 99.7 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). 	-- Tradearabia News Service",http://tradearabia.com/news/ogn_380673.html

The Oil and Gas Disputes Survey, conducted by law firm CMS, identified these and other forms of climate change activism as the biggest issue of concern - with 37% of respondents saying they represented a significant threat. Protestor disruption to offshore and onshore worksites was listed as the second most pressing area of concern, with 26% of respondents saying it was a real risk for their company or company group. The survey was based on more than 50 responses from senior legal managers and senior in-house counsel in the oil and gas industry across Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America. It found that 37% of all respondents, and 50% of those operating there, identified the UK Continental Shelf as the global region with the greatest risk of disputes arising. Projects, joint ventures and dealings with host nation states were seen as the main factors behind oil and gas legal disputes. The survey also indicated that more could be done to prevent them, highlighting a number of areas where disputes could be mitigated - including managing change in projects; better understanding of local market factors prior to project execution; and better record keeping.

Seplat issues $650 million oil and gas bond By - March 30, 2021 Seplat Petroleum Development Company, a Nigerian independent oil and gas firm, has issued $650 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2026. It is said to be the largest ever Nigerian oil and gas bond issuance. A senior note is a type of bond that must be repaid before most other debts in the event that the issuer declares bankruptcy. It is more secure than other bonds. The dual listed company said the five-year bond was well-received in the market with orders from high quality institutional investors. The notes priced at a yield of 7.75%, representing a significant pricing reduction from its $350 million debut issuance in 2018, which priced at a yield of 9.50% , with a coupon of 9.25%, a statement by the company read. The offering was well oversubscribed with demand from 120 global investors from more than 20 countries resulting in a final overbook in excess of $1.1bn, which was 1.7 times book coverage. The global coordinators on the transaction are Citi, J.P. Morgan, Standard Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. Natixis, Rand Merchant Bank and Socit Gnrale served as joint bookrunners while FCMB Capital Markets, Nedbank, United Bank for Africa (UBA) and Zenith Bank Plc were co- managers on the transaction.

Phongsthorn Thavisin, PTTEP Chief Executive Officer, disclosed that PTTEP, through its subsidiary PTTEP Sarawak Oil Limited, commenced the drilling of the Sirung-1 wildcat well in Block SK405B in January 2021. The well, spudded in January, was drilled to a total depth of 2,538 meters where it encountered a significant oil and gas column of more than 100 meters, in the clastic reservoirs. An appraisal well is scheduled in near future to assess the upside resources, PTTEP said. The Sirung-1 exploration well marks PTTEPs third discovery offshore Malaysia following SK410Bs Lang Lebah and SK417s Dokong. PTTEP also plans to explore nearby prospects in this PSC next year. The achievements have strengthened our investment base as we continue to expand our exploration horizon in Malaysia, said PTTEP CEO Phongsthorn Thavisin. Petronas Vice President of Exploration, Upstream, Emeliana Rice-Oxley said: The Sirung-1 discovery further proves the presence of oil, especially in the under-explored deeper play within the Balingian Province.

549,Colorado's cleanup of the oil and gas industry,gjsentinel,"Mar 28, 2021",2021-03-28 09:45:00,"By RODGER STEEN Print By RODGER STEEN Unless you have an oil well in your backyard, you will probably not be aware of the effort being made in Colorado to finally require the oil and gas industry to clean up its operating wells, and to accept responsibility for reclaiming the land after use. For federal mineral rights managed by the Bureau of Land Management, several bills are currently being considered in the House to address the enormous reclamation funding gap. At the state level and for privately owned mineral rights, this effort is largely being carried by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). It does not make for exciting news, but it should because of the resulting cleaner air in the future and lower impact on both the federal and Colorado budgets: 1. The air emissions from these operations are invisible, but contribute to toxins and ozone-precursors; and, 2. the unfunded liabilities for cleanup of the impacted properties is estimated by the COGCC at more than $18 million (215 declared orphans at $82,500 per cleanup as of July 2020) for Colorado. This cost estimate addresses only the officially orphaned wells. There are multiples of these that are unlikely to ever produce again and will not have viable and identified operators but are not yet declared orphans, so the real costs to Colorado are expected to be much more. Until now, the oil and gas industry has gotten a largely free ride in impacting our health, welfare and environment; and leaving their trash when they are finished for us, the public, to clean up. This is changing. Regarding the environmental impacts, in the past two years through Colorados Senate Bill 19-181 the industry is now required to install emission control technology that has been available for more than two decades, which minimizes the emissions of toxins, other ozone-forming hydrocarbons, and methane, a major greenhouse gas. Operators are now required to capture the useful gas product that they were previously free to vent (with or without flaring) to the atmosphere at no cost to them. They did not pay royalties on any gas that they vented (any gas not captured and sold was free to them). Operators are now required to regularly scan the wells for leaks with special hydrocarbon-sensing cameras and to repair them quickly. Frequent scanning is particularly important because hydrocarbons are slippery in that they seep out of joints, connectors, and valves easily, and cannot be seen without that camera. There are many more regulatory changes, too numerous to list here, that move the tradeoff of production cost vs. impact on the public more toward the publics interest. Regarding financial obligations for wells on non-federal minerals, currently our COGCC is in the process of establishing rules for requiring the industry to fully fund the cost of plugging old wells, removing obsolete equipment and restoring the well sites back to pre-use condition. This involves posting of bonds or other forms of financial value committed at the time of well permitting in an amount needed to fully restore the sites. An associated part of these new regulations is defining a clear trigger for declaring a well as abandoned and requiring cleanup. The industry has become proficient at never declaring a well dry and abandoned, so they never have to spend the money to clean it up. Similar financial obligations for wells on federal minerals are being considered by BLM through federal level legislation and under different political forces not addressed in this article. A funding mechanism for wells on non-federal minerals is also being considered by COGCC in the current rulemaking for the more difficult issue of cleanup and restoration of the many orphan sites, sites that still have trash equipment, often still leak hydrocarbon gas and have no identifiable and financially viable owner. Restoration of these sites involves properly plugging the well, removing trash equipment and restoring the surface, including access roads, which are also considered the responsibility of the current industry to fund. In the past a common business model of the industry was to pump a well nearly dry, then sell that well in order to dodge the financial obligation to restore it. The purchasing company would collect and sell the remaining oil, then declare bankruptcy, causing the well to be orphaned. We look forward to new rules that will eliminate these unacceptable business practices in Colorado.

550,Don't blame Biden for oil and gas decline,santafenewmexican,"Mar 28, 2021",2021-03-28 03:00:00,"The Biden Administration has enacted several climate orders that will protect public lands, water, wildlife and people. With the confirmation of Deb Haaland as the new secretary of the Department Save The Biden Administration has enacted several climate orders that will protect public lands, water, wildlife and people. With the confirmation of Deb Haaland as the new secretary of the Department of the Interior, these orders should begin to take effect. Two are especially important for our state: The 30x30 Initiative that aims to protect 30 percent of our land and water by the year 2030, and a pause on new oil and gas leasing on our public lands. As New Mexicans, we have an innate appreciation for the nature that surrounds us. Our vast and diverse landscapes, filled with rivers, valleys, mountains and wildlife, extend for hundreds of miles to paint an unparalleled skyline. This beauty is worth protecting for future generations, and finally we have an administration that recognizes this and is taking decisive action. Currently, 90 percent of public lands in the country have been leased to oil and gas companies, leaving only 10 percent to be used for recreation, conservation or literally anything other than fossil fuel and mineral extraction. I find it to be an atrocity that we have allowed corporations to continue land-grabbing and withholding these spaces, putting profits over our health and well-being. Every 30 seconds, the U.S. loses a football field worth of land, which is why the 30x30 Initiative, and our push to reestablish community access, are so important. Although the extractive industry already manages nearly 40 million acres of public lands across the nation, the pause represents a fundamental change in approach to how federal property will be prioritized from here on out. Addressing climate change has reached the forefront, while oil and gas, accounting for an estimated 25 percent of the countrys emissions, is rightfully phasing out. Much of the land held by oil and gas corporations is not getting used for extraction. Instead, it is merely hoarded as a way of preventing loss of access and influence. Without any actual oil and gas production, taxpayers are not only being excluded from enjoying this land, but also from the substantial royalties that the industry claims to provide. New Mexicos list of natural resources does not begin and end at the quantity of fossil fuels we sit on. While those reserves are finite, the economic value of using our beautiful outdoors for recreation, conservation and education can be harvested infinitely. Replacing squandered oil and gas leases with these kinds of programs will provide a net source of revenue for the state, while also avoiding additional costs incurred from oil and gas exploitation, like environmental cleanups, recovery projects and health care. Last year, over 70,000 acres of land in New Mexico were leased to the industry. Yet, according to a report by Rocky Mountain Wild, less than 6,700 acres are expected to sell in 2021, showing a stark decline in interest for new federal leases. In fact, the industry has been stockpiling permits in preparation for the new Biden administrations expected actions on leasing, and major operators are confident they can continue operations years into the future. Despite vicious complaints against the moratorium and the 30x30 Initiative, the oil and gas industry is clearly aware of its own downfall. If we are to prevail against climate change and leave New Mexico inhabitable for our children, we must preserve our land, water and wildlife, and put our unnecessary dependence on oil and gas to an end. We deserve a future that is sustained by equitable access to a clean environment, so lets support the efforts of the Biden administration.

552,Local New Mexico leaders defend oil and gas industry amid leasing review,currentargus,"Mar 27, 2021",2021-03-27 10:53:00,"The DOI embarked on a review of its oil and gas leasing policy amid a pause on new oil and gas leases on federal land enacted by President Joe Biden. View Comments Leaders from institutions in oil and gas regions of New Mexico which benefit directly from fossil fuel production on federal land defended the industry and warned restrictive federal policies could endanger local economies throughout the state. A rural school district, hospital and local well operator were represented during a press conference hosted Thursday by the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association following a forum held by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) on its ongoing review of federal oil and gas leasing. The DOI embarked on the review amid a pause on new oil and gas leases on federal land enacted via executive order by President Joe Biden. More: New Mexico enacts tougher emissions rules on oil and gas, calls for 98 percent gas capture The review was intended to study the environmental impact of extraction on federal land while also analyzing and potentially upgrading the Departments leasing policies. Participants at the conference called on the federal government to respect the economic contributions of oil and gas in creating jobs and state revenue, along with the industrys efforts to mitigate its own emissions and carbon footprint. The oil and gas industry contributes about 100,000 jobs and $1.5 billion to the state each year, per NMOGA records, money the Association argued goes toward public schools and other needed government programs. More: New Mexico Indigenous leaders criticize oil and gas industry amid Interior's federal review The benefits oil and gas bring to human health were obvious at the Nor-Lea Hospital in Lovington in the oil-rich Permian Basin region of southeast New Mexico, said hospital administrator David Shaw. He said using oil and gas revenue, the hospital was able to build a new cancer center and attract new staff as the industry accounted for more than half of the facilitys mill levy contribution. The oil and gas industry in Lea County has contributed considerably to the success of our organization and our ability to improve the health of southeast New Mexico residents, Shaw said. Prior to the addition of the cancer center residents had to travel over 250 miles round trip for treatment. None of these advances and improvements in health status would have been possible without the contributions of the oil and gas industry. More: Ahead of Interior's oil and gas leasing forum, enviros dispute industry impact claims Kayli Ortiz, a preschool teacher at the Reserve Independent School District in rural Catron County, a rural area on New Mexico's western border, said her school was operating in-person since August as many other schools shifted to online-only instruction amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Ortiz said this meant additional staffing and instructional materials were needed, resources funded, she said, by oil and gas. All of that adds up very quickly. Its been no small feat for us to do that. We needed a lot more resources and human capital than we did in recent years, she said. Its no secret oil and gas is really important to education in New Mexico and what resources were able to provide in the classroom. What impacts oil and gas in New Mexico will also impact its kids. More: New Mexico's political leaders call for President Biden to end oil and gas restrictions Jason Sandel executive vice president at Aztec Well Family, an oil and gas drilling and well service operator in the San Juan Basin in northwest New Mexico argued that while he, a registered Democrat, supported the Biden administrations priority for climate change, the sweeping executive order to stop oil and gas leasing had an instant, troubling effect. Sandel said almost immediately upon issuing the executive order, drilling rigs that can staff 25 people and bring up to 100 associated jobs were laid down. We want our community to flourish, not fade away. I appreciate the commitment of the Biden administration to combat climate change, he said. Yet, I do not believe arbitrarily shutting down the industry through unilateral administrative orders is productive. We felt the impacts immediately. More: Deb Haaland to lead Interior amid concerns from New Mexico oil and gas industry Environmental groups argued the Biden administration must update its oil and gas policies not only to prevent continued pollution and effects like climate change but also to ensure taxpayers get fair returns for use of public lands. Mark Allison, executive director at the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance said current federal policy puts at risk endangered species and sensitive habitats throughout the state. We cannot continue using a decades-old system to manage our public lands -- especially when that system allows oil and gas leasing in areas of critical environmental concern and prioritizes leasing above managing lands to protect their wilderness characteristics, he said. The Interior Departments public forum demonstrated that the administration is on the right track to better manage our public lands for their multiple uses and we look forward to seeing action to put the needs of communities and wildlife above the interests of oil and gas executives. More: New Mexicos land was often disproportionately impacted by oil and gas, said Jesse Deubel with the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, causing harm to conservation and outdoor recreation. Deubel said federal reforms were needed to encourage a diverse use of public lands throughout the state. Communities across New Mexico have long been harmed by a federal oil and gas leasing system that prioritizes oil and gas development over wildlife conservation and outdoor recreation like hunting and fishing, Deubel said. Its beyond time for some common-sense reforms to the leasing program. We look forward to the administration modernizing its rules and practices and working with Congress to enact additional reforms.

558,The Future Of U.S. LNG Hangs In The Balance,oilprice,"Apr 01, 2021",2021-04-01 00:00:00,"U.S. LNG has the potential to be a vital geopolitical tool for the U.S. and a key part of its energy future, but the emissions associated with the fuel may become a problem Soaring American exports of liquefied natural gas LNG could become a powerful tool of the Biden Administration to help other countries reduce their carbon footprint from more emission-intensive fossil fuels such as coal, U.S. shale gas producers say.  Moreover, American natural gas is the sharpest diplomatic tool the Biden administration can wield in energy-related foreign policy and international trade negotiations, David Callahan, president of the Pittsburgh-based Marcellus Shale Coalition, wrote in InsideSources.com this week.  However, the Biden Administration doesnt yet have a precise position on natural gas, especially with regards to the domestic energy mix in light of the climate agenda and the ambitions to have 100 percent clean electricity by 2035.  U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said last week, We need to get to 100% clean electricity by 2035, acknowledging this is a very ambitious goal.  Just for reference, natural gas accounted for the largest share of U.S. utility-scale electricity generation in 2020, at 40.3 percent, with fossil fuels at 60.3 percent share, also due to coals 19.3-percent share of the power mix.  Despite the growing global backlash against natural gas and despite its clean energy agenda, the Administration may have to forgo a tough stance on gas, at least in the short and medium-term, with the narrative that American LNG is helping major coal-dependent energy consumers such as China and India to burn a fossil fuel that is cleaner than coal.  In energy-related foreign policy, the Biden Administration is following the Trump Administrations tough stance toward the Russia-led Nord Stream 2. It has reiterated threats of U.S. sanctions on companies helping Russian giant Gazprom to complete the controversial natural gas pipeline in Europe.  Related Video Saudi Arabia Goes All-In on Hydrogen  American LNG is gaining ground in Eastern European countries like Poland and Lithuania. Those countries are eager to shake off Russias dominance over their natural gas supply - and the political clout that comes with it.  But Western Europe has started to have second thoughts about imports of U.S. LNG due to the emissions associated with shale gas production. This could potentially undermine the LNG-related diplomacy in western European countries.  In Asia, the worlds main gas demand growth driver, U.S. exports of LNG have been soaring, according to EIA data, and could contribute to the coal-to-gas switch in China and India.  Secretary Granholm said during a confirmation hearing at the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources  I believe U.S. LNG exports can have an important role to play in reducing international consumption of fuels that have greater contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.  She also noted that If confirmed as Secretary, I also look forward to working with U.S. industry in ways to reduce emissions associated with this commodity.  The emissions associated with LNG exports have started to become an issue for some buyers, such as Frances utility Engie, which at the end of last year backed out of talks surrounding a long-term U.S. LNG supply deal due to the emissions problem.  Gas demand in China and India is set to continue to increase and offer a growing export market for U.S. LNG exports. Still, in Europe, the green agendas are complicating the role of the fuel in the future.  Clean energy cannot yet be deployed on the scale needed, fossil gas may still play a role in the transition from coal to zero emission electricity. But I want to be crystal clear with you  fossil fuels have no viable future. That also goes for fossil gas, in the longer run, Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, said last week.  Related Will 2021 Mark The Start Of A Major Shale Recovery  The global outlook for gas demand is more robust than that for oil, primarily due to Asian demand.  But in view of the climate agendas and energy transition in developed economies, Gas players will have to show commitments to decarbonize natural gas, including through carbon capture, utilization and storage CCUS and blue hydrogen, Wood Mackenzie vice president Massimo Di Odoardo said.  U.S. shale gas has a high carbon footprint, and thats the Achilles heel of American LNG supply, according to WoodMacs Director of LNG, Giles Farrer.  Were starting to see US producers change behavior, stopping routine flaring and setting targets to reduce methane leakage. But itll take years of tighter control  regulation or industry-led  before US upstream gas competes on carbon intensity with global basins, Farrer said.  America is one of the top three LNG exporters in the world, after Qatar and Australia, but the future of U.S. LNG sales could now depend not only on surging Asian demand but also on buyers demand for low-emission cargoes.

The European Commission launched a public consultation on Tuesday (30 March) about the upcoming revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, which was last revised three years ago The consultation is open until 22 June, with an updated directive expected in Q4. Three policy options are envisaged in the Commissions inception impact assessment. Tellingly, the first is no policy change, while the second option is mainly about soft measures such as technical assistance and information campaigns. The third option is the one green campaigners will like most: it concerns the phased introduction of mandatory minimum energy performance standards for different types of buildings (public and private, non-residential and residential). One option could be to start with stricter requirements for specific types of buildings, such as public buildings or office buildings, and to extend progressively the requirements to other buildings, the document says. More Climate law: It takes two to tango. Climate law negotiations are making sluggish progress, with critics warning that the Parliament and Council are endangering the Commissions June package of climate legislation by digging in their heels. Green shadow rapporteur, Michael Bloss, said the Council needs to find a new mandate: Compromise needs two to tango and currently, we are ready to dance and we wait for the Council to accept our invitation. Suzana Carp from the think tank Bellona Europe, said there is room in the Councils mandate for it to budge on the 2030 target, particularly on the net aspect of the 2030 target: Im pretty confident that the Council will have to move, but also I know that there are quite a few member states who actually dont support the net target approach. Theyre extremely worried about what it would mean at COP 26. We also got a glance inside the room where negotiations take place as one of Blosss team snapped a selfie during the talks. (Kira Taylor | EURACTIV.com) Peoples Climate Case thrown out. More 2030 target drama happened in the European Court of Justice, where the landmark case of 10 families from the EU and beyond who took the EU to court over its former 40% emissions reduction target, was dismissed on procedural grounds. They argued the target violated their human rights by failing to tackle climate change and, therefore, it failed to protect their life, health, occupation and property. But, while the Court agreed they are affected by climate change, it overturned it on the grounds of 1960s case law, where an individual must be uniquely affected by an EU legislative act to challenge it. Climate Action Network Europe says the decision points to a wider issue of poor access to justice for environmental matters and displays a fear of action by citizens while the coordinating lawyer for the case, Roda Verheyen said: The EU courts failed to interpret existing rules in the context of climate change. This judgement is wholly unconvincing and only speaks of the fear of action by citizens. (Kira Taylor | EURACTIV.com) Tense trade.

560,Oil trader Gunvor eyes $500 million in renewables deals,fuelfix,"Mar 30, 2021",2021-03-30 13:20:10,"One of the largest independent oil traders looks to adapt and profit from the energy... Comments One of the largest independent oil traders looks to adapt and profit from the energy transition. Gunvor Group, one of the largest independent oil traders, said it will invest at least half a billion dollars in non-hydrocarbon fuels and technology as looks to adapt and profit from the energy transition. The ambitious commitment by the Geneva-headquartered firm, which will also see it pledge steep emissions cuts from its refining and shipping operations, highlights the shifting strategies of the biggest oil traders. Even after a year of knock-out profits from trading oil, commodities merchants are prepping their businesses for a looming shift to cleaner fuels. We did have a great year in trading -- one of our best ever, Torbjorn Tornqvist, Gunvors chairman, co-founder and chief executive officer said in an interview. We will continue to do trading, but we also think long-term and we do have to address the energy transition. Gunvor set up a new unit called Nyera, which Tornqvist says translates from his native Swedish to new era, to focus on investments in carbon capture and storage, renewable power and alternative fuels, including ammonia and hydrogen. It hopes to spend at least $500 million on projects in the next three years. The Swiss firm isnt abandoning its role as a trader, Tornqvist said. Rather, it hopes to play a bigger part and gain insight in different commodities and technologies, such as hydrogen, that will eventually be more freely traded. We are a trading company. The core of our abilities is not investing in new technology, Tornqvist said. Gunvor handles about 2.7 million barrels of crude and oil products a day, making it one of the five-largest independent traders. So-called transitional commodities including liquefied natural gas - in which its the biggest independent trader - and biofuels now account for about 50% of the firms trading activity. These areas are expanding and proportionally they will take a bigger role. That doesnt mean trading is going down, Tornqvist said. Bigger rivals Vitol Group and Trafigura Group have also ramped up investments in solar, wind, hydrogen and carbon capture deals. Vitol has invested in solar and wind projects as a well as a U.K. carbon capture project. Trafigura started its Nala Renewables unit in 2020. In addition to Nyera, Gunvor vowed to reduce its direct scope 1 emissions from its owned refineries and ships by 35 percent by 2025 and its scope 2 indirect emissions by 95 percent compared with 2019 levels. It will also target scope 3 emissions, which includes the impact of the entire supply chain and use of products. Gunvors three European refineries will switch to running on renewable or carbon-neutral electricity with its facility in Rotterdam developing new processes around hydrogen and vegetable oil processing, Tornqvist said. The company already owns two biofuel plants in Spain that account for less than 1% of Gunvors overall scope 1 and 2 emissions. Gunvor also said its Clearlake Shipping unit will shift its fleet to be 100 percent Eco vessels by 2022 with ships that surpass industry environmental standards.",http://fuelfix.com/business/energy/article/oil-trader-gunvor-eyes-500-million-in-renewables-16063226.php

Global supply chains were already strained before the massive ship, the Ever Given, ran aground Tuesday in foul weatherblocking hundreds of other ships loaded with oil, liquefied natural gas, and goods from making their way through one of the worlds busiest maritime channels. The narrow, 120-mile long Suez Canal connects the Red Sea and the Mediterranean and is a nexxus of international trade, providing shippers from Asia a faster route to Europe and the West, rather than having to travel around the African continent. J.P. Morgan said the canal accounts for 10% of global maritime trade. Reports Thursday said nearly 200 ships were backed up waiting to enter the canal as crews worked desperately to dislodge the Ever Given, which is about as long as the Empire State Building is tall. J.P. Morgan analyst Marko Kolanovic said in a note that there is a risk of the ship breaking, which could block the Suez Canal for an extended time. He suggests hedging that risk by buying oil, as well as stocks in the energyand shipping sectors. Oil has been volatile recently. On Thursday, West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, fell 5% to $58.14 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was down 4% to $61.70. Oil is coming down from highs seen earlier this year, which had helped push the shares of major producers higher.

Gas Plan Boosts Taup Energy Hub Friday,  2 April 2021,  2:42 pm Press Release: Firstgas Group A plan to blend Taup -generated hydrogeninto local natural gas supplies, before switching todelivering 100 per cent hydrogen by 2050, will boost thelocal energy economy according to Firstgas Group, whichoperates the natural gas pipe networks in the North Islandand owns Rockgas, an LPG supply and distributionbusiness. A report released by Firstgas thisweek details Taups role in a nationwide change over thenext thirty years toward zero carbon gases. Based onthe report, Firstgas Group says it can phase in natural gasblends of up to 20 per cent hydrogen from 2030, while a fullswitch to hydrogen-only could be completed nationwide by2050. Hydrogen Project Leader, Angela Ogier, said thechange to hydrogen could create dozens of jobs in apotential new regional energy industry: making hydrogen topower factories, homes and transport as well as to storeenergy for periods of high demand. The report foundthat gas infrastructure in Taup is made of modernmaterials and equipment that can be repurposed to supplygreen hydrogen  a zero carbon alternative to naturalgas. The hydrogen can be made in Taup, mixed intonatural gas, and distributed by pipeline to commercialcustomers such as those in agriculture, horticulture, andhospitality, and to residential customers. Ogier said,Businesses and households will not need to change theirgas appliances just yet to accommodate the blending ofhydrogen into natural gas. They will have twenty years ormore to switch to hydrogen-friendly appliances when oldequipment reaches the end of its life. The reportidentifies Taup as a potential base for hydrogengeneration. The site is best suited because of proximity tothe gas and electricity networks and water supplies.Newly-built electrolyser plants will use electricity tosplit water into hydrogen and oxygen. Changing tozero or low-emission gases would mean more energy optionsfor local consumers, and a totally new industry in the localeconomy, explained Ogier. The hydrogen would bemade by new businesses, hiring local workers and suppliers.It would be blended into the local network without customersneeding to change equipment just yet. The plan isto start gradually, generating enough Taup hydrogen toblend into natural gas, and producing enough by 2050 todisplace natural gas entirely. At that point, weenvisage hydrogen would also be fuelling totally new usessuch as powering trains, buses and trucks. Ogiersaid the addition of hydrogen to the local energy industrywould increase the ability of the region to handlefluctuations in demand and supply, and outages, across alltypes of energy.

568,Oil Jumps On Surprise Crude Draw,oilprice,"Mar 31, 2021",2021-03-31 14:39:00,"Oil prices rose slightly on Wednesday morning after the EIA reported a small draw in crude inventories amid rising U.S. refinery activity Crude oil inventories last week shed 900,000 barrels, the Energy Information Administration reported, adding inventories were at 6 percent over the five-year average for this time of the year.  The report comes a day after the American Petroleum Institute reported an estimated build of 3.9 million barrels in crude oil and compared with a more moderate build of 1.9 million bpd that the EIA reported for the previous week.  Analysts had expected an even more modest inventory build for last week, at 400,000 barrels.  In gasoline, the authority reported a 1.7-million-barrel decline in inventories for the week to March 26. This compared with a small build of 200,000 barrels for the previous week.  Gasoline production rose on the week, to 9.3 million bpd, compared with 8.6 million bpd a week earlier.  In middle distillates, the EIA estimated an inventory build of 2.5 million barrels for last week, which compared with a build of 3.8 million barrels for the previous week.  Distillate production averaged 4.7 million bpd last week, compared with 4.6 million bpd for the previous week.  Oil prices are above $60 ahead of the April OPEC meetings, to take place tomorrow and on Friday. The market has more or less priced in an expected agreement to roll over current production cuts into May and June, even if Russia gets the small increase in production it asked for in response to higher seasonal demand at home.  The global demand picture, however, remains mixed. Covid-19 cases are on the rise in much of the United States and Europe, casting a shadow over earlier expectations that as vaccinations gathered speed cases will begin to fall steadily.  This has injected additional uncertainty in an already uncertain market, enhancing the volatility of oil prices.  At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $63.82 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $60.66 a barrel.

The bearish crude oil build was likely offset somewhat by the large 6.01MMbbls gasoline stock drawdown. Continued USD strength has also had limited impact on oil prices so far today, whilst reports that the OPEC+ Joint Technical Committee (JTC) have revised lower their demand growth forecasts for this year from 5.9MMbbls/d to 5.6MMbbls/d has had little impact on the market. Instead, the market continues to be focused on the OPEC+ meeting taking place on 1 April. As we have mentioned, there does appear to be a growing consensus that the group will likely rollover the current cuts, with them wanting to avoid a sell-off in the market, particularly given the more recent flaring up in Covid-19 cases. The OPEC Secretary-General has also told the JTC that OPEC + needs to remain very cautious. However, OPEC+ are still of the view that inventories will fall below the 5 year average by July, and that is assuming that the current level of cuts are not rolled over.

The trend usually signals increasing demand in the coming quarter, aligning with expectation. Strong demand has already started unfolding, with major steel products prices continuing to gain amid declining stocks.

Agriculture The European Commission (EC) released its short term energy outlook yesterday with the expectation that production of both wheat and corn would recover strongly in 2021/22 on higher acreage and better yields. The Commission expects soft wheat production to recover 8.2% YoY to 127.7mt in 2021/22 after falling 10.7% YoY to 118mt in 2020/21. Higher domestic production and relatively subdued demand could see ending stocks rising to 12.9mt (+3.4mt YoY) at the end of 2021/22, the largest stocks since 2017/18. The Commission also expects corn production in the EU to increase by a robust 9.7% YoY to 71.5mt in 2021/22, the biggest crop in 7 years with ending stocks to increase from 19.1mt at the end of 2020/21 to 21.6mt at the end of 2021/22. For sugar, the EC estimates that sugar production in the EU could drop 12% YoY to 14.4mt in 2020/21, owing mainly to beet yellow virus disease in France, which could push ending stocks to a decade low of 1.1mt at the end of the season. For 2021/22, the Commission estimates acreage to be largely flat at around 1.5m ha, whilst yields could improve which will result in healthy production gains for the year.

571,Warnings over energy greenwashing as households switch to eco tariffs en masse,independent,"Mar 31, 2021",2021-03-31 07:00:00,"80 per cent of gas and electricity switchers picked green energy tariffs in 2020. But just how green are they? Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy notice Understandably, there has been growing demand from customers to be able to make a difference by switching their energy supply to a more sustainable source. Providers have been quick to latch on to this emerging trend, with the majority of tariffs on the market now labelled as green. However, environmentally conscious households might not be getting exactly what they had hoped for. Since the level of power directly sourced from renewable energy appears to track behind the level of tariffs that claim to be green, some suppliers seem to be generously marketing tariffs to consumers as green or renewable, when in fact the fuel is not sourced sustainably. More needs to be done collectively by the industry to make the fuel mix of tariffs more transparent for customers, and we need stricter criteria before a tariff can be labelled ""green"" or ""renewable"", Earl adds. Uswitch.com has this week launched a Green Accreditation for green tariffs, to help consumers understand the different approaches suppliers are taking on renewable energy tariffs. It is designed to explain and show the differences between energy tariffs, how far suppliers go to support renewable energy generation, and debunk myths like the belief that burning gas is green, and that wind generated energy is not. The figures come as the government announced it was scrapping its 1.5bn Green Homes Grant scheme, launched just six months ago as a key part of the build back better promise against the backdrop of the pandemic. Originally expected to create thousands of jobs and demonstrate the governments commitment to reducing households carbon footprints ahead of the UN climate talks, known as COP26, which the UK will host in Glasgow in November this year. Instead, from more than 123,000 applications for grants of up to 10,000 for energy efficiency improvements including double glazing and insulation, fewer than 6,000 projects have been completed. Not only has the abandonment left the UK without a plan to tackle one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, but households with inefficient systems like single glazing will now have to find the full amount to improve their homes, reduce their emissions and cut their bills. But these arent the only problems plaguing bill payers. Earlier this month, energy industry regulator Ofgem reported that 18 suppliers had failed to correctly protect customers tariff prices when they decided to switch supplier or tariff. They failed to implement price protection rules which protect a customers tariff price when they decide to either switch suppliers or tariffs after a price increase. Most of the failures were down to suppliers not having adequate arrangements in place to make sure the protections were applied in full when customers decided to switch, and several self-reported to the regulator. But the mistakes mean more than one million customers were overcharged by more than 7.2m. The customers affected included those on standard variable and fixed term tariffs who switched suppliers or tariffs. Most of the failures were down to suppliers not having adequate arrangements in place when customers decided to switch. Most of the failures were down to suppliers not having adequate arrangements in place to make sure the protections were applied in full when customers decided to switch. The suppliers have since agreed to refund all affected customers, and in some cases make goodwill payments, to the tune of 10.4 million. Ovo Energy, British Gas, Shell, Scottish Power and SSE have the largest numbers of cases to settle, at between 132,000 and 240,000 each. Where it has not been possible to process refunds, the suppliers have agreed to make payments to the energy redress fund.

CNBV reported on Saturday, citing data from MarineTraffic and ClipperData, that at least ten tankers and containerships had been diverted from the blocked Canal, with a MarineTraffic spokesman telling the network there would be more. According to MarineTraffic, there are well over 200 vessels stuck waiting in the Suez Canal.  The incident that many are already calling a Suez Crisis pushed oil prices higher last week after it became clear that freeing the Ever Givenone of the largest containerships in operation globallycould take weeks. Some 3.6 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products pass through the chokepoint daily.  Both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate gained more than 4 percent on Thursday but started retreating on Friday on the back of a stronger U.S. dollar and pandemic-related factors, as well as the fact that Middle Eastern producers send less oil via the route that passed through the Suez Canal than other chokepoints.  The Canal only has diluted importance as a transit hub for energy, Bob Yawger from Mizuho Securities told Bloomberg on Friday, adding that the stronger greenback and the incredible inability of the euro zone in particular to take care of the Covid situation had a bigger part to play in oil price movements, as the well as the latest infection numbers in the U.S., which are on the rise.  Even if the effect of the Suez Crisis on oil prices is limited, it is costing global trade, and quite a bit according to insurer Allianz, global trade could take a hit of $6-10 billion a week from the incident, with annual trade growth experiencing a cut of 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points. For every day the Canal remains blocked, it holds up trade worth 9.6 billion.  The latest reports say that the Ever Given was successfully refloated earlier today, but efforts are still underway to clear the vessel from the canal.

Citing the latest available figures available from the GECF Global Gas Outlook 2050 Sentyurin noted that natural gas supply in the UNECE region will increase at an annual average growth rate of 0.8%, representing an overall increase of 29%, climbing from 2,320 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2019 to around 3,000 bcm in 2050. The UNECE region will be responsible for 18% of the total gas demand growth through to 2050. Despite ambitious decarbonisation targets in many UNECE members, natural gas will retain a critical role in regions energy mix, being the most resilient hydrocarbon resource, added HE Sentyurin. Sign up for our newsletter The 8th edition of the Group of Experts on Gas sessionnoted that the UNECE region is falling short of its commitments and objectives on sustainable energy. The Group concluded that its key contribution to achieving these objectives could be in two areas: (a) deep transformation of the energy system; and (b) reducing the environmental impact of energy. Natural gas, it was asserted, should begin to be seen as beyond a fuel, and as a vector of energy transition including, notably, hydrogen and bio-gas. Francisco de la Flor Garcia, Chair of the Group of Experts on Gas: A (UN) General Assembly resolution adopted on 21 Dec 2020 recognised the key role that natural gas plays in many countries and calls upon governments to enhance energy security through sharing of best practices in security of gas supply and demand. I interpret this resolution as a clear mandate for our continued work. Other areas that came under discussion were best practices in methane management in the gas sector, decarbonisation through synergies between gas and electricity, hydrogen, sustainable production and consumption of gas and liquefied natural gas, and gas in transport. The Group recommended that reducing pollution levels and improving air quality will be tied to factors such as: Improved access to natural gas supply Improved monitoring and remediation of methane losses Upgrade of bus fleets with natural gas-powered buses Cleaning marine transport by developing LNG bunkering in city harbours TAGS",https://www.powerengineeringint.com/emissions-environment/eu-must-recognise-natural-gas-as-key-to-energy-transformation/

The drive comes as the United States ramps up shipments, with 164.3 million doses sent since rollouts began, and as more companies are encouraging staff to return to offices.  More than a quarter of the U.S. population has received at least one dose, and 45.5 million, out of 331 million residents, were fully inoculated as of Tuesday, according to government data. 1d ago Oil Plunge Deepens With Renewed Lockdowns Clouding Horizon (Bloomberg) -- Oil tumbled to the lowest since early February as a string of renewed lockdown measures in Europe clouded the prospects for a speedy recovery in consumption.U.S. benchmark futures plunged 6.2% on Tuesday, and the oil futures curve collapsed into a structure indicating near-term weakness. Europes demand recovery is set to take another hit with Germany, France and Italy all having widened lockdown measures this month. Meanwhile, coronavirus cases are surging in India and threatening the economys recovery from recession.West Texas Intermediate and Brent settled below their respective 50-day moving averages for the first time since November, which may add further selling pressure on prices. The nearest Brent futures contract traded at a discount to the next month for the first time since January -- a pattern known as contango that points to oversupply. WTIs so-called prompt spread was also in contango.The swing lower was triggered by the deteriorating near-term demand outlook in the face of still hampered refineries, surging interest and renewed European lockdowns, Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said in a note. With prices breaking below the 50-day moving average during the session, technical traders may well take WTI lower still.Prices were little changed following settlement after the American Petroleum Institute was said to report domestic crude supplies rose 2.93 million barrels last week. If confirmed by U.S. government data on Wednesday, that would be the fifth straight weekly gain in inventories. Meanwhile, the API report also showed gasoline supplies falling by 3.73 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles grew.Oil has been touted as a popular hedge for inflation, with restrained producer output helping drive global inventory drawdowns as countries worldwide try to emerge from the pandemic. But Tuesdays selloff provides the latest abrupt setback to an otherwise remarkable price recovery in the wake of signs of weakness in physical markets and hiccups in economic reopening plans.Things looked great for a couple weeks and a bunch of funds jumped in, but they possibly decided it was premature, said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research. Amid what looks like some bearish demand based on the pandemic in Europe, everybody decided to selloff.In other markets, the dollar climbed, making commodities priced in the currency more expensive, and an advance in U.S. Treasuries showed haven buying, adding to the risk-off mood.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:U.S. production costs signal that WTI is as vulnerable as it was near the 2018 peak. Even if optimistic outlooks for a quick return to pre-pandemic consumption play out, U.S. producers have plenty of incentive to keep supplying more crude than demand can absorb.-- Mike McGlone, BI commodities strategistThe weakness in the nearest part of the futures curve comes as stockpiles built up last year are being unwound from storage, according to consultant Energy Aspects. The contango structure is unlikely to last because the removal of oil from inventories is part of the markets ongoing re-balancing, the consultant said.The road to oil demand recovery appears to be full of obstacles, said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at consultant Rystad Energy. The depth of the correction is surprising in a way, as we are just about a week ahead of the upcoming OPEC+ ministerial meeting on April 1 and as the U.S. fiscal stimulus is supposed to boost market confidence.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P. 1d ago Shale Patch Feeling the Cost Creep as Workers Return to Drilling (Bloomberg) -- Explorers in the U.S. shale patch are starting to see signs of higher costs as drilling begins to ramp up afte",https://news.yahoo.com/graphic-energy-transition-risks-political-045205479.html

Investors in Santos STO.AX overwhelmingly opposed a resolution that would have pushed the company to spell out moves to wind down its oil and gas operations to help curb global warming,  according to proxy votes shown at the annual meeting. Shareholders in rival Woodside Petroleum WPL.AX will vote on the same resolution, proposed by activist group Market Forces, later on Thursday. ""Santos does not intend to close down its oil and gas operations as doing so would be against the interests of shareholders and would not be consistent with global climate and human development goals,"" Santos Chairman Keith Spence said at the annual meeting, held online. More than 86% of the proxy votes cast ahead of Santos' annual meeting were against the resolution, with 13.28% in favour. Market Forces, nevertheless, took heart from the votes in favour of its resolution. ""With today's vote almost doubling the previous record set for a fossil fuel wind up resolution, all coal, oil and gas producers must take note: investors are increasingly willing to demand drastic action to align with global climate goals,"" Market Forces campaigner Will van de Pol said. Although the votes were disclosed, its resolution was not put to a vote as it required shareholders to approve a move to amend the company's constitution first. Proxy votes were 94.4% against amending the constitution. Santos and Woodside initially also faced climate resolutions from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), working with British hedge fund manager Chris Hohn's Say on Climate campaign. ACCR withdrew its resolutions after both companies agreed to put their climate reporting to a vote at their annual meetings in 2022. In contrast to Europe's oil majors, Santos and Woodside are not chasing renewable energy, but instead are looking to develop hydrogen production and plan to offset their carbon emissions through tree planting or carbon capture and storage (CCS). ""Hydrogen with CCS will ultimately eliminate our emissions, and that's our plan,"" Spence told shareholders.

584,Texas oil pipelines face dry months as production languishes,oilandgas360,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:30:11,"The latest oil and gas news, dedicated to all things oil and gas: people, technologies, transactions, trends, and macro-economic analysis that impact commodity prices. NEW YORK -Nearly half of all oil pipelines from the Permian basin, the biggest U.S. oilfield, are expected to be empty by the end of the year, analysts and executives said. Source: Reuters Pipeline companies went on a construction spree throughout 2018 and 2019 to handle blistering growth in U.S. crude production to a record 13 million barrels per day (bpd). However, the coronavirus pandemic crushed both fuel demand and oil production, and neither have recovered fully, leaving many pipelines unused. Major pipeline companies are exploring ways to ship other products in those lines and considering selling stakes in operations to raise cash. The coronavirus pandemic upended the global energy supply system and worldwide fuel demand. U.S. gasoline consumption is now estimated to be past its peak and as refiners process less crude, producers are not filling pipelines used to transport it. By the fourth quarter, total utilization of the largest oil pipelines from the Permian is expected to drop to 57%, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said. The nadir during the last market bust in 2016 was roughly 70%. U.S. crude output is currently about 11 million bpd, and is not expected to grow much until 2022. But more pipelines were already set to come online, growing the gap between production and capacity covered by long-term contracts to a record over 1 million bpd in February, according to energy research firm East Daley Capital. We do not expect to be at pre-COVID production levels by end-2022, said Saad Rahim, chief economist at commodities merchant Trafigura. REVENUES HIT The top three Permian pipeline companies are offering discounts to entice shippers and stem the fall in volumes. Companies rely on long-term contracts that require customers to ship a certain volume of oil or pay a penalty. Now companies are renegotiating those agreements at lower rates when they are close to expiring, to keep their customers. Magellan Midstream Partners LPs transportation and terminals revenue slid 9% to about $1.8 billion in 2020, the lowest since 2017. The company has only enough long-term contracts to fill its 275,000-bpd Longhorn pipeline to 70% capacity over the next six years, Magellan said. With more pipelines adding to competition, Magellan expects daily volumes on Longhorn to drop to an average 230,000 bpd this year versus 270,000 bpd in 2020. A Magellan spokesman said the company could use its marketing arm to buy space on the Longhorn line and sell it to ad-hoc buyers. Plains All American Pipeline LPs transportation revenues fell about 13% to $2 billion in 2020, and warned that earnings could suffer further if production declines. Plains did not comment for this story. Pipeline companies can make some money even when oil is not flowing through pipelines. Producers pay what are known as deficiency payments  penalties for not shipping oil. Still, those payments are small. Plains reported $71 million in deficiency payments in 2020, less than 4% of its overall transportation segment revenue. Some companies are considering retrofitting pipelines to ship liquids besides crude, such as renewable fuels. Enterprise Products Partners LPs co-Chief Executive Jim Teague recently told analysts that he was fielding queries from a petrochemical company that needs pipeline transport and storage for potential hydrogen projects. Enterprises crude pipelines and services revenues plunged 35% in 2020. In February, it said it has long-term contracts to ship about 1 million bpd through 2028 and beyond, compared with average volumes of 2 to 2.2 million bpd over the past two years. The company did not comment for this story. As pipeline companies have struggled, investor returns have suffered. The Alerian MLP index, which tracks the performance of midstream companies, is down 24% since the beginning of 2020, compared with a 27% return for the S&P 500. A lot of companies had to cut their dividends, said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at TortoiseEcofin. It has created some skepticism on the investor base about the sustainability of the sector.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/texas-oil-pipelines-face-dry-months-as-production-languishes/
585,"The Best Energy Stock, Period -- The Motley Fool",fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"There can be only one. Dec 9, 2009 at 12:00AM A recent email exchange with an investor buddy of mine went something like this: Jeff: What's the best energy company you know of between, say, $1 billion and $20 billion in market value? All sub-sectors count. Toby: The best-run company? The best value? Jeff: How about one of each? Gee, thanks for the softball question there, Jeff. Very well. I'll give it a shot. While the market capitalization caveat might seem broad, it actually constrains my choices a good deal. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) , arguably the greatest company in the history of the world is obviously too big to fit the bill. So are independents like XTO Energy, EOG Resources, and Anadarko Petroleum. Meanwhile, longtime favoritesContango Oil & Gas and ATP Oil & Gas (NASDAQ:ATPG) are too small for consideration. Among E&Ps, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) is a contender for best value. It's tough to beat the company's shale exposure and expertise. That said, Chesapeake's low market cap belies significant financial leverage that caused trouble during the credit crisis, and potentially led the company to miss out on a killer acquisition Chesapeake management has a taste for excess, exemplified by CEO Aubrey McClendon's ridiculous wine collection, several thousand bottles of which were to be auctioned last month.  For best-run -- in which conservatism, shareholder-friendliness, and good governance are all key factors -- I would opt for Range Resources, Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN) Turning to the midstream players, I've been partial to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (NYSE:KMP) since identifying it as a profit machineback in 2007. Having risen out of the ashes of Enron the company has delivered 25% annual returns since inception (with distributions reinvested). Dollar-a-year man Richard Kinder and crew are serious capital allocators. The company also stacks up well in EnergyPoint Research's most recent customer satisfaction survey. When it comes to oilfield services, you know I love my offshore drillers. Topswould be Noble (NYSE:NE) , with Ensco International running a close second Aside from being exceptionally well-managed, these companies also look quite cheap -- if not five-bagger cheaplike Chesapeake. Another standout in the services realm is Core Laboratories (NYSE:CLB) . This rock jock was my pick for Best Stock for 2009 Through yesterday's close, the stock had delivered a year-to-date total return north of 80%. While Core Labs isn't obviously undervalued today, this may be the best energy company I know of, period. It's one that Jeff should get to know, and you should, too.

586,Oil and Gas Companies' Shares Popped: What You Need to Know -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"Is this meaningful or just another movement? , and Northern Oil & Gas (AMEX: NOG) all rose more than 10%, leading the way for the energy industry. So what: Oil has spiked 3.6% today, rebounding after a week of worry over Europe's debt problems kept the fuel source near recent lows. The price of oil has a strong impact on service providers because producers will stop drilling if prices get too low, and there was fear that the downturn in prices would be long-lasting given Europe's extensive problems. For today, that fear has subsided, and the energy industry is hot again. Now what: Everyone from driller Precision Drilling (NYSE: PDS) to do-everything service company Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) and explorers such as Kodiak Oil & Gas (NYSE: KOG) traded sharply higher today given oil's movement. Just as with oil, many of these stocks have been down in the dumps recently, so the move today is a welcome sight. The news out of Europe and the U.S. was positive today, but I would be cautious placing a big bet on a recovery and, therefore, oil at this point. Europe has a long way to go before its debt problems are over, and with growth still anemic in the U.S., I don't anticipate a sharp rise in oil prices in the near future. It might be prudent to sell the highs and buy the lows right now, because oil is probably in a bit of a holding pattern until we get an indication one way or the other of where the economy is headed.

587,Marcellus Shale Keeps Turning Heads -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"Rounding up the latest highlights from the ) Sep 23, 2010 at 12:00AM The Marcellus shale first crossed my radar in late 2007, at which time I dubbed it the next great gas play Before too long, major media outlets began hitting on the massive potential here, and the Marcellus has been hogging energy headlines ever since. Here's a roundup of a few of the most recent highlights. Flashy gas flows On the development front, National Fuel Gas (NYSE: NFG) subsidiary Seneca Resources announced a pair of eye-popping initial production rates in Pennsylvania. One, operated by joint venture partner EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) , reportedly flowed at a 24-hour rate of 8.9 million cubic feet per day, while a Seneca-operated well clocked in at 15.8 million per day. For context, Cabot Oil & Gas saw an average 24-hour IP (initial production) rate of 7.5 million per day for Marcellus wells completed in 2009, and one of its recent completions IP'd at 18.4 million per day. You know how I feel about 24-hour initial production rates There is no standardization, and the results of a single well can easily be overhyped Seneca's rates aren't so high as to be suspect, but the release of these results in tandem with the announcement that Seneca has hired an investment bank to shop around a joint venture interest in a broad swath of its Marcellus acreage still smacks of showmanship. It reminds me a bit of an operator that cashed inon the Haynesville hoopla late last year following a big well test by partner Devon Energy. Another Asian buyer We've seen a steady stream of joint venture deals in the Marcellus, such as Chesapeake Energy's (NYSE: CHK) tie-up with Statoil (NYSE: STO) and Carrizo Oil & Gas' more recent partnering with India's Reliance Industries. This week, Gastar Exploration (AMEX: GST) joined the JV party. Korean investment firm Atinum Partners has agreed to earn a 50% interest in Gastar's 34,200 net acres of Marcellus shale leasehold by paying $30 million in cash and carrying $40 million of Gastar's future drilling costs. While the per-acre valuation of around $4,100 comes in far below what firms like Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) and Atlas Energy have netted from hungry Asian partners Gastar wasn't bargaining from a position of strength. The company doesn't have much cash on its balance sheet, so this is still a very positive development for the small firm. Get the frac out of here Of course, any Marcellus roundup wouldn't be complete without a bit of environmental controversy. As I wrote last year, this play has become the country's frac battleground Many perceive the hydraulic fracturing process, which bombards the wellbore with large volumes of water and sand, along with a mixture of salts, acids, and other chemicals, as threatening regional water supplies. This has led Range Resources (NYSE: RRC) to take the leadin disclosing the chemicals used at each well site. Some regulators aren't taking any chances, though. Back in May, the Delaware River Basin Commission issued a temporary ban on new drilling permits in the four-state basin while it crafts new regulations. In response, operators like Newfield Exploration suspended leases in the area, which includes northeastern Pennsylvania. Over the past week or so, some signs have pointed to an easing in some of the DRBC's most restrictive proposed measures. Early drafts had required a $5 million assurance bond for each well site, which would have locked out all but the industry's heaviest of heavyweights. That requirement is reportedly being scaled back. On balance, though, this region will likely be a tough place to operate once the regulatory dust has settled. For those of you investing in the Marcellus shale, I would probably suggest sticking to counties in Pennsylvania and West Virginia where drilling is already well-established, rather than stretching out into areas where the industry might be unwelcome.

588,The World's Most-Watched Oil and Gas Company -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"Which energy companies showed up on the biggest chunk of investors' watchlists? ) Dec 31, 2010 at 12:00AM With exploding wells, shifting regulations, and uncertainty for investors, some players in the oil, gas, and consumable fuels field are teetering on the verge of collapse, while others are poised to profit. It's among the most-watched industries among those who have created a watchlist with the Fool, and today we're able to single out the one energy player that is garnering the most attention. People watch stocks for different reasons -- they're waiting for a dip in price, watching for a specific catalyst, gathering all the news and information that might affect stocks they already own, or considering a sell. Regardless of their motivation, we can better understand market sentiment by seeing who's watching what. With the Fool's free My Watchlist servicenow three months old, we have tens of thousands of people telling us the businesses that have, for whatever reason, piqued their interest. And the most-watched company in this volatile industry is... Drumroll, please Looking at the aggregate data, we see that ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is the leader in terms of watch interest, the percentage of people keeping an eye on the oil and gas industry in general who are specifically watching each company. Though this industry is more fragmented than most, with 359 individual companies showing up on at least one investor's watchlist, ExxonMobil boasted a 9.1% watch interest -- and for good reason. As Fool analyst Dan Caplinger recently wrote it appears that ExxonMobil and its peers could have interesting and profitable times ahead. ""Once a company gets as big as ExxonMobil, it's unusual to see fast growth -- the amounts of money involved are simply too great,"" he wrote. ""ExxonMobil will never be able to match the consistent quick growth rates of smaller energy-related companies like ATP Oil & Gas or National Oilwell Varco, if only because of the law of large numbers."" But he added that because all players in the field are sensitive to oil and gas prices, we can expect big swings in sales figures from year to year. And with the market's infatuation with dividend investing, ExxonMobil is an obvious option for those seeking healthy payouts. ""Even here, though, you'll feel the effect of the company's gargantuan size; competitors Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) both have higher dividend yields and have grown their payouts at a faster pace in the past five years,"" Dan also wrote.

What's in it? Some oil and gas equipment companies had strong performances over the past year. Chart Industries (Nasdaq: GTLS) , for example, specializing in equipment used in the production of hydrocarbon and industrial gas, advanced 19%. Bulls who expect natural gas to be fueling many vehicles in the near future like the company, as it supplies storage tanks among other things. The company clearly believes in the future of liquefied natural gas, as it's been beefing up its LNG infrastructure manufacturing capacity to meet expected demand. Still, if natural gas prices rise considerably, the stock's future may not look quite as bright. Many other companies in the industry didn't do as well last year, but could see their fortunes change in the coming years. Weatherford International (NYSE: WFT) , for example, sank 44%, partly due to an estimate that it will fork over some $100 million in settlementswith multiple U.S. agencies investigating possible improper practices abroad. Bears worry that there may be further bad news and costs. The company has been plagued with tax-related problems as well. On the plus side, though, Weatherford recently reported solid revenue growth, though its earnings disappointed analysts a bit. Offshore drilling specialist McDermott International (NYSE: MDR) shed 41%, but sports a hefty and growing backlogof orders. Two months ago the stock surged 10% on news that the CEO and three other bigwigs bought sizable bunchesof stock. There aren't many explanations for that other than the executives expecting the company's stock to rise. Then there's Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) , down 37%. Yes, it has reported flat earnings recently, but they still exceeded analyst expectations and revenue also beat expectations, rising 22%. The company has been very involved in fracking, but some see a possible pullback as natural-gas producers have been reining intheir operations.

590,Oil and Gas: Picking up the Buying Pace -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"A foursome of facts is increasing the pace of U.S. oil and gas deals. ) Sep 30, 2008 at 12:00AM Mix together a foursome of factors, including lower energy commodities prices, high development costs at some of the nation's non-conventional oil and gas plays, squeezed credit markets, and a rash of geopolitical ills in other producing areas of the world, and you have the makings of increased oil and gas deal activities. The result has been something of a shopping spree by the nation's bigger oil companies. For instance, BP (NYSE:BP) has bought a couple of deals wherein it's lightened Chesapeake's (NYSE:CHK) load in both Oklahoma's Woodford Shaleand the Fayetteville Shaleof Arkansas. And Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) recently agreed to spend about $1.25 billion to buy properties in Texas and the Rocky Mountains from Plains Exploration (NYSE:PXP) Beyond that, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) recently spent nearly $6 billion to buy Canada's Duvernay Oil. Duvernay has been a major player in the Montney tight sands gas play north of the border. As oil and gas prices slide, it becomes progressively more difficult for smaller companies to ante up the amounts necessary for development of, for example, unconventional gas plays. Those plays typically involve gas trapped in tightly packed sands, shale rocks, or coal beds and aren't cheap to develop. At the same time, operating in politically precarious places like Nigeria, Venezuela, or Russia can be both operationally and financially challenging for the major oil companies. Not long ago, for instance, Shell announced that, because of tribal battlingin Nigeria, a substantial amount of its production has been shut in and, as a result, its earnings will be affected. Shell, BP, and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) all have experienced varying degrees of difficulty operating in Russia, with Shell effectively being forced to sell its assets on Sakhalin Island for a below-market price. And then there's the credit crunch, which has made it difficult for small and medium-sized producers to get outside funding for their exploration and production plans. In contrast, Exxon had nearly $40 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of the last quarter, and the 2.8 billion of its shares the company holds are worth about another $215 billion. So, for my money, all these factors point to an increase in oil and gas dealsgoing forward, especially those involving Big Oil companies as purchasers. It's a scenario that should make the petroleum industry well worth Fools' attention for some time to come.

What the numbers don't tell you Kodiak's weak start to the year turned around in a hurry when the company reported gangbusters growth in its 2011 annual report That proved to be its high-water mark in 2012, as the company's first-quarter results didn't entice investors despite a narrowly profitable bottom line. Many smaller Bakken playershave slid somewhat this year, roughly matching the slight decline in crude prices. Triangle Petroleum (NYSE: TPLM) resisted the declinebetter than Kodiak, but Samson Oil & Gas (NYSE: SSN) and Northern Oil & Gas (NYSE: NOG) have both had their stocks hurt badly by declining crude prices: KOG Total Return Price data by YCharts As I pointed out earlier, there are a few other factors inhibiting Kodiak's gains. Fellow Fool Dan Caplinger notes that depreciation and hedging lossesheld back the bottom line this year, but those hedges might become a net positiveif crude prices take a turn for the worse. Capital expenditures have been extremely highover the past year as well. Rapid growth is great, as long as it results in profitability. Weakening economies around the world could be very bad news for Kodiak and its peers, which rely on higher crude prices to stay profitable. Shale oil, which Kodiak extracts with the help of Halliburton's (NYSE: HAL) hydraulic fracturing expertise costs several times more per barrel to produce than ""easier"" oil, as I pointed out last year Crude is safely above the breakeven point today, but it's already much lower than it was for much of last year, when Kodiak's hype was highest. If Europe falters, China slows down, or America's anemic growth grinds to a halt, crude oil might not be worth its extraction costs for Kodiak any longer.

594,Reflections on the New Oil and Gas Reserve Rules -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"These SEC rules can obscure or reveal a great deal, depending on how a company handles the transition. ) Feb 8, 2010 at 12:00AM If you've checked out any of the new reserve reports being released by oil and gas producers, you've probably noticed that the new SEC rules make comparisons to prior-year reports virtually meaningless. Fortunately for us, companies are explaining the effects in great detail and presenting their numbers both according to the old rules and the new rules. This exercise is revealing a lot of useful information for energy investors. What's new, wildcat? To review quickly, here are a few major changes in the rules, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 2010: Reserve calculations now use the average oil and gas price for the first day of each month of the prior year, instead of the year-end price. Of the 65 comment letters the SEC received from folks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Apache (NYSE:APA) in response to the agency's proposals, the CFA Institute appears to be the only party to oppose the principle behind this popular measure, which is intended to smooth out volatility and seasonality effects. The definition of ""oil and gas activities"" now includes unconventional sources like bitumen from oil sands This allowed Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) to add 603 million barrels of proved synthetic crude reserves in Canada (nearly 90% of total net reserve additions) to its ledger. Companies are permitted to disclose probable and possible reserves in SEC filings. A December 2009 Ernst & Young survey found that 83% of operators would not include these figures in their upcoming 10-Ks, however. Operators can book more proved undeveloped reserves (i.e. on planned future drilling sites in the vicinity of existing wells), as long as reliable technology exists to conclude that these locations are reasonably certain to be developed economically. Picture an X in the center of a tic-tac-toe board, representing the drilled location. All the O's you plunk down around it would be your proved undeveloped (PUD) locations. Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) has booked 1.2 PUD locations for every proved developed well in the Marcellus shale, while Petrohawk Energy (NYSE:HK) has booked Eagle Ford PUDs at a roughly 5:1 ratio. With certain exceptions, PUDs should only be recognized if there is a plan to develop them within five years of the original booking date. And you thought Avatar had crazy effects We looked at the impact of some of these rule changes on Petrohawk last week The firm's PUD bookings exploded by 227%, leaving them to account for two-thirds of total proved reserves. As a result of drawing so many O's onto the tic-tac-toe board, finding costs were cut in half. Meanwhile, because Petrohawk's reserves are 98% natural gas, the firm's estimate of future cash flows (PV-10) was decimated by the low average annual price of $3.87 per million BTU. In its press release, Petrohawk did a decent job of explaining the effects of the new SEC rules, but not a great one.

It's the engineeringand construction group, and I'd urge Fools to pay heed to the results of Fluor (NYSE:FLR) (NYSE:MDR) , two of the gang's big international players. Both of the Texas-based companies did well in the quarter, although from a pure growth perspective, Fluor led the way. Its 119% jump in net earnings, to $209 million, was impressive, and its operating profit for the quarter more than doubled. It also received new awards totaling a record $6.4 billion, enough to push ts backlog up to a record $33 billion. I find it especially interesting that the company's new awards included $1.8 billion for the Greater Gabbard Offshore Wind Farm power project in the United Kingdom. If, like a lot of us, you're looking for a way to play on the increasing attention the world is paying to wind energy that may be an answer. As for McDermott, its $177.5 million in net income for the quarter represented a 19% improvement year over year. That growth followed a 26% revenue increase. The companies are both involved in oil and gas-related construction, and as you might suspect, both did well in that area. Fluor's Oil & Gas segment saw its revenue increase by 56% to $3.3 billion in the quarter, while its sector operating profit expanded by 68%. Its new oil, gas, and petrochemical awards in the quarter totaled $3 billion. As for McDermott, its Offshore Oil & Gas Construction unit checked in with revenue that grew by more than 50%.

596,Huge Oil and Gas Reserves? Prove It! -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"More companies come clean about their prized assets. Feb 23, 2010 at 12:00AM Earlier this month, I praised Forest Oil (NYSE:FST) for its exemplary disclosure with regard to the new SEC rulesfor reserve reporting. The company made it very plain how various changes, such as monthly average pricing versus a single year-end price for oil and gas reserve calculations, affected its reported figures. While some companies, like EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) , have fallen short in this area, I'm pleased to see that Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) has done a fine job explaining to investors how its year-end reserve report was affected. As with other natural gas-weighted exploration and production companies, Cabot saw a negative impact from prices, which were lower on a monthly average basis than they were on Dec. 31. This pulled a bit more than 101.6 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) out of the proved reserve category. That's a very small impact relative to the company's total reserves, which exceed 2 Tcfe. I take this as a sign that, as with Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) , Cabot's assets hold up wellin a depressed gas price environment. Taking a slightly larger chunk out of reserves was the change in how E&Ps can book proved undeveloped (PUD) locations. In response to the SEC's initiative to get companies to be more realistic about locations that they plan to drill, Cabot removed virtually all PUDs booked more than five years ago. I'm not clear on the quantity of PUDs the company booked under the new, more permissive SEC rule regarding offset locations, but the company noted that its percentage of PUDs rose by 5%, to 36% of total reserves. That's still on the low end. Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) PUDs popped to 42% and EOG came in at 46%, while Petrohawk Energy (NYSE:HK) saw its PUDs skyrocketto 67% of total reserves. Cabot made a very important point in its release that all E&P investors should consider when assessing the conservatism of reserve reports this year. The future development cost associated with Cabot's PUD bookings (i.e., the money needed over the next five years to turn these claimed reserves into producing assets) is $1.1 billion. That's less than two years of cash flow at present rates. Compare this situation to Petrohawk, which generated a level of cash flow comparable to Cabot over each of the past two years, but pegs future development capital at nearly $3.2 billion. That doesn't appear to leave a lot of wiggle room. As annual reports get filed over the next few weeks, I'd suggest watching companies' anticipated future development costs like a hawk.

U.S. benchmark WTI Crude rose strongly through to Thursday but lost most of its gains when markets opened on Friday, leaving it trading at just over $92. Natural gas prices have been weaker, but still look set to end the week slightly higher, with natural gas on the September contract trading at around $2.85/mmbtu on Friday morning. The strong oil price has provided gains for investors in the United States Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) , which was up by 1.4% on the week when markets opened on Friday, having lost most of the week's gains overnight. The United States Natural Gas Fund (NYSE: UNG) also opened lower on Friday morning, and was down 1.5% on the week. Strong oil prices always help lift oil and gas shares, but this week has seen some junior oil and gas shares manage to outperform the market by a big margin. Here are three of this week's top climbers: Heritage Oil (LSE: HOIL.L) Heritage Oil surged 25% to 153 pence this week as its listing suspension was lifted following full details of a new rights issue to pay for the company's OML 30 acquisition in Nigeria. The deal should provide Heritage with substantial producing assets to complement its exploration activities in Kurdistan. Falkland Oil & Gas (LSE: FOGL.L) Falkland Oil & Gas climbed 15% to 86 pence this week, after details of a second farm-out deal with U.S. company Noble Energy were announced. Falkland also reported it had begun drilling operations on its first well, Loligo. The new farm-out deal with Noble means Falkland should have cash of $200 million remaining after it completes its first two exploration wells. BowLeven (LSE: BLVN.L) BowLeven rose by 10% to 68 pence this week. On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported rumors that a farm-out deal might be imminent on the company's Bomono Permit in Cameroon. BowLeven has not provided an update on its operations since April. Small oil and gas shares are always volatile, yet this week's gains could be just the start of some long-term upside.

599,Should Oil and Gas Investors Fear the FRAC Act? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"What's in that frac fluid? Congress would like to know. (NYSE:XTO) to unlock massive shale deposits like the Barnett and the Fayetteville. Big Oil's lobbyist, the API, has been hootin' and hollerin' about the implications of federal frac fluid oversight, saying that domestic production would drop ""significantly"" if servicers like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) had to report the chemical components added to the water that's pumped downhole and used to fracture hydrocarbon-bearing rock. One industry estimate puts the additional cost of compliance at $100,000 for each new natural gas well. Big Oil (and especially Small Oil), you know I often stick up for you but I suspect you're crying wolf this time. The oil patch is an extraordinarily entrepreneurial place. If certain chemicals are banned from frac fluid, I have every confidence that the contractors will be able to formulate an alternative that doesn't break the economics of the stimulation job. Further, that compliance estimate sounds like a serious exaggeration. Why am I sympathetic to this legislation? For one, state regulatory bodies can become quite cozy with industries that drive the local economy. Second, while the risk of polluting an aquifer seems remote, given that most horizontal drilling occurs much deeper in the earth, I do recognize that there are some rather nasty chemicals involved here, and they have been and will continue to be spilled on the surface. That poses enough of a threat to drinking water to get me concerned. According to local media reports, a recent frac job performed by Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) (NYSE:CHK) in the Haynesville shale play saw some frac fluid spilled, and 17 cows died. To be clear, the outright ban of hydrofracking would strike an incredibly damaging blow to the industry and to our domestic energy supply (hello, Russian gas imports!), but I don't foresee such a threat to the overall practice. No matter what your opinion of members of Congress, I don't think any of them are that stupid. As far as better chemical disclosure goes, I'm all for it. Let's just make sure that our representatives realize what a good thing we have going with shale gas, and that they don't strangle the goose that's laying golden energy eggs.

600,Wednesday's ETF to Watch: iShares Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Fund (IEO) -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"Optimism in the markets has helped boost the price of cude oil. ) Jan 26, 2011 at 12:00AM Optimism over the health of the global economy has surged in recent weeks as investors have scooped up shares in a variety of industries in order to benefit from a budding recovery. This joyful mood has also helped to boost the price of crude oil, which was trending close to its 52-week high, approaching $94/bbl. However, in recent days, fears over a slowdown in key emerging markets and talks of a supply boost from OPEChave weighed heavily on the price of oil, forcing the price back down below the $90 mark. Given this recent volatility in the price of one of the world's most important commodities, investors are likely to focus in on a key earnings report before the bell today for further guidance on the subject from Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) . The Los Angeles-based oil and gas exploration and production firm is expected to help set the tone for the entire exploration sector in the new year with the report, so investors should look for the energy giant to remain in focus throughout the trading session. The company is expected to report earnings of $1.54 a shareon revenues of roughly $5.13 billion, which compares relatively favorably to the year-ago period in which the firm posted EPS of $1.30 on revenues of $4.54 billion. Of particular interest to investors is likely to be the company's recent deals which are likely to drive future earnings for many quarters to come. First, the company's sale of projects in Argentina for $2.5 billion and its subsequent purchase of $3 billion worth of gas fields in the U.S. is likely to weigh on investors' opinions of the stock as the company as OXY continues to ramp up its exposure to natural gas exploration and production projects. In this same vein, further guidance on the company's recent massive purchase of a 40% interest in a large gas fieldin the United Arab Emirates is also likely to play a role in investors' perceptions of the company's outlook. The deal allows OXY to participate in the development of one of the region's biggest natural gas fields under a 30-year contract. However, capital expenditures for the project are not expected to be cheap; some estimates call for roughly $10 billion in spending, a relatively large figure considering that the firm has a market cap of less than $100 billion. Furthermore, the project looks to be fraught with risk as well since it comes after oil giant ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) abandoned the project in mid-2010 in order to pursue other, lower risk opportunities. ""This is good news for Abu Dhabi that they have found someone willing to work on the project, which is very dangerous and costly, and that's why Conoco pulled out,"" Kuwait-based independent oil analyst Kamel Al Harami saidin regard to the Abu Dhabi government deal with OXY. Nevertheless, if the company is able to offer solid guidance based on these deals and other market trends, it could give a nice boost the oil and gas exploration industry at large during Wednesday's session [also see Will Iraqi Oil Deals Boost Energy ETF? ]. One fund that looks to especially be in focus given this key earnings report is the iSharesDow Jones U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Index Fund (NYSE: IEO) . The popular energy ETF devotes 15.9% of its holdings to OXY while also giving large weightings to Apache, Anadarko Petroleum, and Devon Energy. Although IEO has risen with the broad energy market over the past few months -- posting a gain of 24.5% in the previous half-year period -- the fund has slumped back along with oil prices over the past week, pushing shares of IEO down close to 3% in just five days [also read",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/01/26/wednesdays-etf-to-watch-ishares-oil-gas-exploratio.aspx

But then President Hugo Chavez decided to nationalize everythingin sight, stripping the companies of their operating positions in favor of PdVSA, the state-controlled oil company. Now it appears that Chavez is teaming PdVSA up with other state companies from around the world. For instance, PdVSA and Vietnam's state-run Petrovietnam are conducting talks about jointly developing the basin's heavy oil. In addition to the likely Vietnam partnership, it appears that Venezuela could also be involved in separate Orinoco deals with the China National Petroleum Corporation -- perhaps through its PetroChina (NYSE:PTR) subsidiary-- and a Russian consortium. The reported objective of all this activity is to increase the country's production capacity by as much as three million barrels a day in the next few years. Good luck, Hugo. And speaking of Russia, that country apparently is headed in the other direction, according to a Wednesday Wall Street Journal article entitled ""Russia Revives Privatization.""

602,An Exciting African Oil and Gas Play -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"Ophir Energy reports on an impressive six months of exploration activity. Aug 29, 2012 at 12:00AM LONDON -- Ophir Energy (LSE: OPHR.L) has had an impressive run of form since joining the London market in July 2011. Its shares have since more than doubled from 250 pence to 533.5 pence, where it is valued at more than 2 billion pounds, cementing its position in the FTSE 250 index. Ophir's assets span a number of African countries and were boosted earlier this year by the $220 million acquisition of Dominion Petroleum. Ophir also raised $242 million through a share placing in April, and this raised its cash balance to $454 million as of June 30, 2012. Like most exploration-focused oil companies, Ophir has no revenues and at present is currently loss making. The loss for the first six months came to $24 million, although a further $148 million of exploration expenses were also capitalized on its balance sheet. Tanzania has been a particular hot spot for Ophir in the last six months, where it is drilling in partnership with BG Group. To date, it has had a 100% success rate with six wells, including Jodari-1, where a resource estimate has been made of 3.4 trillion cubic feet of gas. In other parts of Tanzania, and also in Kenya, Ophir is seeking farm-in partners to help fund its exploration programs, and will be opening data rooms for potential partners during the remainder of this year. In Equatorial Guinea, Ophir has drilled two wells in a three-well program, with both the first two wells making discoveries. The third well is currently in progress. Some rationalization of Ophir's portfolio is taking place as well, however. It is pulling out of Uganda and last month sold its interests in the Democratic Republic of Congo to Soco International for $9 million. Ophir's chairman Nicholas Smith said: Ophir cemented its leading position in East Africa with the successful acquisition of Dominion Petroleum, and is now actively exploring the new acreage in Tanzania and Kenya. Our equity placing in April 2012 provided the Group with the necessary funding to further explore the resource potential within Blocks 1, 3 and 4 in Tanzania, and also to progress the rest of our portfolio. We look forward to continuing our active exploration programs through the second half of 2012 in the key plays of both East and West Africa.

603,Will ATP Oil & Gas Strike It Rich in Israel? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"The offshore exploration and production company has commenced drilling in the Mediterranean. May 2, 2012 at 12:00AM Investors of ATP Oil & Gas (Nasdaq: ATPG) are generally focused on its operations in the Gulf of Mexico, which means that at times we tend to forget that this company also has operations elsewhere. ATP has started drilling operations in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Israel. The next exciting discovery? ATP has initiated drilling operations at the Shimshon block in the Levant Basin with its partner Isramco Negev. This could be a challenge to Noble Energy (NYSE: NBL) , which until now has been the sole foreign operator in Israel. According to an investor presentation last month, the Shimshon block sits atop 2.5 trillion to 3.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, of which 0.9 to 1.2 TCF are net to ATP. Additionally, ATP owns stakes in the Daniel East and Daniel West blocks. Now that's a huge find. There are reasons to believe that these figures are genuine, namely the successes of Noble Energy in the adjacent fields. The Leviathan and Tamar fields are the biggest gas finds in the last decade. The Leviathan field, in particular, is estimated to hold a staggering 20 TCF in natural-gas reserves and around 600 million barrels of oil. Last December, Noble announced successful appraisal results here, encountering natural gas in multiple intervals. The proverbial cash cow? These numbers are incredible. Production from these fields in the Mediterranean will mean easy supply to the European and Asian markets. In the local market, natural gas currently trades around $6.50 per million cubic feet, which is phenomenal, considering the $2-per-MCF prices we are seeing in the U.S. If things go as planned, this should turn out to be a great move in the long run. Selling natural gas in its liquefied form in markets that have more demand is nothing new. While Cheniere Energy (AMEX: LNG) recently won approval to export natural gas to Asian markets Chevron (NYSE: CVX) has been busy working on the Wheatstone and Gorgon LNG projectsoff the coast of Australia. The behemoth has been eyeing the Japanese and Chinese markets in particular. Understandably, the only problem with ATP is its balance sheet, which is loaded with debt With a debt-to-equity of more than 700%, investors might want to think twice before investing in its stock. However, keep in mind that the company has always had this unique business model, wherein it has managed to fund its operations primarily through debt -- and with successful results. Foolish bottom line Strategically, the Israel move looks good. With the kind of expertise ATP has in offshore drilling, this project could turn out to be a cash cow for the company. Investors should watch this company like a hawk. The Motley Fool will help you do just that; all you need to do is add ATP Oil & Gas to your free watchlist . Natural gas is on everyone's mind these days. Some say now is the time to jump on board, while the market is at the bottom.

604,How Valuable Is Northern Oil & Gas? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"The company's assets must be capable of generating profitable returns. ) Oct 28, 2011 at 12:00AM When it comes to the oil and gas industry, assets matter a lot. For companies operating here, there's nothing more important than reserves, rigs, submersibles, and refineries. However, these assets must be capable of generating profitable returns. Value for money These returns indicate whether a given company has the capability of using its assets efficiently and profitably. After all, it makes little sense for an exploration and production company to have a lot of acreage but not the ability to pull out the oil (or natural gas for that matter) within. In short, it pays to find out how valuable these assets are to the company. Here, we will find out whether a given company's assets are profitable and efficient compared to its peers based on some important metrics: Return on assets, or net income divided by total assets shows how much the company is earning compared against the assets it controls. The ratio is an indication of how effectively the company is converting the money it has invested in reserves, property and other equipment into net earnings. Higher the value, more profitable the assets are. The metric is pretty useful when used as a comparative measure -- against peers and also against the industry in general. A value greater than 3.5% is what investors should be looking for in this industry. Fixed-asset turnover ratio, or revenues divided by total fixed assets (like plant, property and equipment). Fixed assets form a major chunk of total assets for companies in this industry. This metric shows how efficiently the company is using its fixed assets to generate revenues. The higher the turnover rate, the better. A value above 0.43 looks pretty good. Total enterprise value/discounted future cash flows shows how expensive the company is when compared against its standardized future cash flows. The denominator indicates the total present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10% per annum. It's based on today's energy prices and doesn't give any credit for unproved reserves. With these factors in mind, let's take a look at Northern Oil & Gas (AMEX: NOG) and see how it stacks up against its peers: Company",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/10/28/how-valuable-is-northern-oil--gas.aspx
605,A Way to Handle Cheap Natural Gas -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"Oil and gas prices have separated. Here's what to do. and Diamond Offshore (NYSE:DO) , all of which are getting smacked around by Mr. Market today. They serve companies in both the oil and gas industries. Here, in a nutshell, is what appears to be going on with natural gas: As the Journal points out, new technology -- and I'd add in a bevy of new plays, as well -- could double our gas production growth rate this year to 8%, versus 4% in 2007. At the same time, with our economy slowing, the growth of U.S. demand could be cut in half, to 3%, in 2008. That's far more important than the slight decline in gas stocks last week that the Energy Information Administration told us about. Whether crude prices will continue to fall enough to bring the commodities into a semblance of historic balance is anybody's call. My guess is that, given the global spread of crude and the domestic nature of natural gas, they won't. All of which makes me somewhat queasy about full-scale share price recoveries for ""gassy"" independents likeDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) . Indeed, with both oil and gas prices slipping, I also find myself less optimistic about most of the majors, like BP (NYSE:BP) . So why has the oil-gas disparity made me find the service companies more attractive? Simply because they won't become trapped by inter-commodity price discrepancies. Their work will continue -- and their earnings will remain robust -- unless both oil and gas drilling seize up, which is unlikely.

Brent crude briefly breached the $116 level before settling back to around $115, while West Texas intermediate crude came close to $98 per barrel before dropping back to around $96 when U.S. markets opened this morning, leaving it almost unchanged on the week. Natural gas prices have held onto their gains more successfully this week, with the Henry Hub price rising from around $2.70/mmbtu on Monday to $2.81/mmbtu on Friday morning, a gain of 4.5%. As a result, the United States Oil Fund was up by 0.6% when U.S. markets opened today, while the United States Natural Gas Fund was 1.8% higher. High oil prices are continuing to support the share prices of small oil companies, and this week has seen some massive share price moves. I've highlighted three of this week's top performers below: Borders & Southern Petroleum Borders & Southern Petroleum (LSE: BOR.L) rocketed 82% to 33 pence this week. This phoenix-like rise was due to the company releasing its long-awaited analysis of the fluid sample taken from its Darwin exploration well. Borders also reported a mid-case recoverable volume of 190 million barrels of condensate from Darwin -- although its commerciality remains uncertain. Heritage Oil Heritage Oil (LSE: HOIL.L) rose by 18% to 200 pence this week. The company's shareholders were initially disappointed that the company's Miran find was mostly gas, but those that kept the faith were rewarded this week when Heritage announced a double whammy, monetizing Miran with a farm-out to Genel Energy while using the remainder of Miran to secure a loan from Genel, preventing it from needing to use a dilutive equity issue to pay for its recent Nigerian acquisition, OML30. Advantage Oil & Gas Advantage Oil & Gas (NYSE: AAV) surged 13.5% to $3.70 yesterday after revealing that it is planning to sell noncore assets and prepare the company for a sale. Advantage fell heavily recently after disappointing quarterly results. The Calgary, Alberta-based company has 1.1Tcf of proved and probable gas reserves in Canada's Montney shale formation, output from which is being lined up to supply a proposed LNG export facility.

Revenue should keep growing When companies use fracking to extract oil and natural gas from shale-rock formations, they use a great deal of water, and expenses can run as high as $400,000 per fracturing attempt. A million new wells will be fracking by 2035, so the industry is seeking ways to recycle the water to make the operations as efficient and cost-effective as possible. Meanwhile, with an upcoming EPA report expected to link fracking with water pollution, we'll see an increased demand the for companies that can clean up the exploration and extraction activities. Both of these developments are likely to increase revenues even more for Heckmann, with its presence in all the significant fracking fields and its contracts already in place with every major player. Is a holiday short squeeze coming? Heckmann's stock price is low, with heavy insider buying and a high short position, and the change in insider ownership is up more than 134% over the past six months. Shareholders could profit from a short squeeze in which those holding a short position are forced to buy thus raising the stock price. The insider buying is bullish in itself. Tom Gardner CEO and co-founder of The Motley Fool, once advised that if he were to select just one criterion for investing, ""I wouldn't look for growth. I wouldn't look for a great balance sheet. I would focus only on insiderownership."" Profit without the risks of drilling The recent acquisition of Power Fuel  focused attention on Heckmann and lifted the share price as Wall Street realized that the deal had created a major player in environmental services for the oil shale industry. With the fracking boom, Heckmann should benefit more than those doing the actual exploration and extraction. Even if there is no oil or natural gas found, there will be a great need for Heckmann's services, allowing for shareholders to profit when others don't.

608,4 Bold Energy Predictions for 2011 -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"Reflections on 2010 and a look forward to 2011. ) Dec 17, 2010 at 12:00AM After reflecting on the big themes of 2010, here are a few that I came up with: BP's Macondo oil spill and its fallout The ongoing natural gas glut courtesy of the Haynesville and other booming shale plays. The mad dash by independent E&Ps to get oily and the rise of the Eagle Ford, Niobrara and other liquids-rich plays. The return of the oil sands, including this giant IPO Insatiable foreign demand firing the long-term supercyclefor coal. giving way to frustrationregarding America's nuclear renaissance. A stronger-than-expected year for solar, overshadowed by concerns over weakness ahead A generally tepid turnout for other alternative energy businesses, including windand geothermal. Many of the above themes are interrelated. Weak natural gas prices encourage E&Ps to search for oil, and they also push down electricity prices. That hurts conventional power producers, but especially higher-cost renewable sources. As the head of Shaw Group pointed out recently, we're likely to see a lot more movement on nuclear power in places where natural gas runs $7 or $8 per million BTU, rather than the $4 or $5 that we've seen domestically for the better part of this year. Defining events like the Macondo disaster are clearly impossible to predict, but that won't stop me from making a few wild prognostications about the year ahead. Bold prediction No. 1: Oil goes higher until it doesn't Oil has begun pushing against the upper end of its trading range in recent weeks, suggesting to many analysts that we're looking at a run back to triple-digit crude prices in the year ahead. Goldman Sachs analysts, for example, see $100 oil by the second half of the year, as global demand remains strong and OPEC spare capacity tightens. Once you add the magic of QE2into the mix, that outcome seems entirely plausible. As oil prices head skyward, investors will get increasingly confident and bid up the prices of speculative oil stocks, including those with no oil production These same stocks will be most vulnerable to implosion when the music stops, so they're probably best avoided if you like to sleep soundly. Bold prediction No. 2: Natural gas does not go to zero Gas is trash today, but there are some reasons to believe we'll see some relief in the year ahead. Three-year leases originating in the land grab of 2008 will be satisfied, allowing producers to dial back on their drilling commitments in places like the Haynesville and Marcellus. Constraints in frac equipment, natural gas liquids processing, and pipeline capacity may keep a lid on activity in various plays. Hedge books will roll off, exposing producers to lower prices. The ongoing permitting purgatory will choke offshore supply growth. I am not even going to attempt to time a rebound in natural gas prices back to the more comfy $6 level. Everyone that has done so has been wrong. I do want to increase my exposure to this sector, though. I offered upContango Oil & Gas (AMEX: MCF) as an idea in late August, and may have missed the boat by not buying at the time. Southwestern Energy (NYSE: SWN) , on the other hand, trades lower than when I tapped it as a low-risk bet That business still looks like a good buy. Something I will not do is invest in an indebted company that's not built to survive persistent weakness in the gas price. My friends over at Motley Fool CAPSare very bullish on Compton Petroleum, but even after the company's recapitalization, I'm just not comfortable with the financial picture. The operating leverage of less indebted producers should produce shareholder returns that are more than satisfactory. Bold prediction No. 3: The world continues to rely heavily on coal This one's simple enough. China and India, while simultaneously pursuing cleaner options in earnest, need coal to power their growing economies. They're looking to Australia, Mozambique, and elsewhere to get it. International companies like Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) will continue to benefit from this trend. I would probably favor export-oriented firms, despite the fact that the U.S. isn't kicking coal anytime soon, either. Bold prediction No. 4: Alternative energy companies with poor fundamentals will continue to flame out This year, we've seen Evergreen Solar (Nasdaq: ESLR) slump toward what looks like inevitable irrelevancy Energy Conversion Devices (Nasdaq: ENER) , whose thin-film laminates will face increased competition from Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) and other well-financed new entrants probably isn't far behind. I'm all for green investment themes, but investors need to tread extremely carefully here. The sector is ripe for hype Well, that's as far as I'm willing to go with my predictions. If you're prepared to go further out on a limb, chime in with one of your own in the comments section. There's a service and equipment company that's well-positioned to profit from many of today's secular trends in the oil patch.

609,Energy Jargon Demystified: Turnarounds -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 23:00:00,"Oil and gas terminology in plain English. ) May 16, 2007 at 12:00AM With all the recent buzz about the energy sector, I thought I'd define a common piece of industry jargon: turnarounds. The expression ""turnaround"" can be particularly confusing, because investors commonly use this term to denote a company that is improving on previously lackluster performance. A turnaround in the refining industry, however, refers to planned maintenance activity that reduces or fully suspends throughput for a period of time. Turnarounds are required in order to maintain productivity and safety at a refinery. They're performed regularly, most often every four or five years. A partial turnaround only takes one or more units offline, whereas a total turnaround takes the entire plant down. Over 30,000 procedures -- from cleaning to repairs to tie-ins of new equipment -- may comprise the work involved in a major turnaround, which can last a month or longer. For reasons of both speed and safety, turnaround activity runs 24/7 until it is complete. That equates to a lot of overtime for the hundreds or thousands of contract workers brought on board for the project. Salary costs generally work out to about half the cost of the turnaround, which often runs into the tens of millions of dollars. Valero (NYSE:VLO) , for example, budgeted $39 million for the turnaround of its largest refinery in 2005. The plant's turnaround manager (a full-time job) estimated at the time that each additional day over budget would cost the company between $1.2 and $3 million. The horrific explosion at BP's (NYSE:BP) Texas City refinery, also in 2005, occurred at the end of a turnaround. Refineries are more dangerous during these periods, because of the volatility of the compounds being moved around within the various units. This further explains the time sensitivity of completing scheduled maintenance. Because fires and explosions are altogether too common in the industry, an incident-free turnaround is something to be cheered.

611,"Railroad commissioner dismissed wind, solar energy in favor of coal, oil",mysoutex,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 21:30:00,"During Texas Energy Day 2021, Texas Oil &amp; Gas Association President Todd Staples sat down with Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian to talk about the year that was and President Joe Save During Texas Energy Day 2021, Texas Oil & Gas Association President Todd Staples sat down with Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian to talk about the year that was and President Joe Biden administrations efforts to back solar and wind power  especially in the state of Texas. With San Patricio County home to several wind farms, which provide tax funds, Christian is eyeing the future of Texas energy as coal, oil and gas  especially through the rough year 2020 brought on the energy industries. The thing is, I have been really encouraged during all the hard things that the year brought, Christian said. The private free market industry can almost always do a better job than government regulations. Ive seen some of the biggest challenges  if not the biggest challenges  hit our industry this past year, and every single time we turn to the free market industry. They overperformed and came to the rescue much better than I think government has ever been designed to do and I think its a great Texas brag. Staples added, Well, you know, its interesting that some states and countries dont operate on the model of working together rather than working against one another. And I think thats how problems are solved. He said that just last year oil was at $24 a barrel and unsure what the future of COVID-19 would hold. Christian met with TXOGA last year and during the oil crisis who then formed the Blue Ribbon Task Force who met and stategized on how to keep the oil pumping during such a difficult time. So what happened of course was the industry saved the United States, Christian said. No doubt the oil and gas industry out here has, since the turn of the century, saved and revolutionized and made a safer, cleaner, better world. This past year specifically because we first were hit with a fight that OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and Russia got together and decided they were going to stop production and get prices going at the same time here comes China with this virus  were not supposed to call it that but Im sorry Mr. Biden  that caused a pandemic worldwide and decreased demand. He continued by saying that the past presidential administration did a great job working for the coal, oil and gas industry. He feels they had support in Washington on the congress and legislation level who were pro oil and gas and pro energy dominance all over the world and sees President Joe Bidens administration as a formidable foe due to his stopping the Keystone Pipeline and looking towards a greener, more environmentally safe future. I mean, (Bidens administration) has done everything you can think of so far to disrupt us, Christian said. It now costs three times the amount for energy for consumers with what theyve done. It puts more locomotives on the railroad tracks which are three times the cost. But Warren Buffetts company makes a lot of money from it. Then theres the Paris Accord, which were paying $78 billion for. Thats 10 trillion a year for the United States. As youre all aware that we now are living under that little darlin, and weve got to live under that for a term. Christian sites the carbon taxes along with rising fees and permitting is hurting the oil and gas energy more than most people realize. We dont need any new taxes and this carbon tax is going be one that tries to dissuade the use of oil and gas, Christian said. So, theres a lot of challenges coming from the administration this next year so weve got to come together with some efforts to fight this. Christian continued by saying that Texas energy companies need help in their recovery while the president is putting money into renewables like wind and solar power. When the sun dont shine or the wind dont blow we let the pilot light  go out on our dependables, Christian said. Theyve spent over 7 billion in just state tax dollars to get powerlines out to the windmills when we put them in, and then weve been spending about a billion to a billion and a half  thats with a B  on it a year since then, and making sure that you buy, wind energy and solar energy before you buy natural gas energy. Were putting most of our tax dollars into the undependables at the cost and risk to lives. pgonzales@mysoutex.com",https://www.mysoutex.com/goliad_advance_guard/railroad-commissioner-dismissed-wind-solar-energy-in-favor-of-coal-oil/article_b02ec77a-9bba-11eb-90d7-07c0336fd738.html

614,3 Stocks to Watch in Integrated Oil & Gas -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 18:03:00,"They might not be the most exciting companies to watch, but they can give you clues regarding the next big thing in oil. ) Jun 5, 2015 at 7:03PM The entire energy market has been on a wild ride as of late -- with the exception of Big Oil stocks. While the price of oil has been nearly halved over the past year, the hit to the share prices of the titans of the oil industry has been more limited. That is by design, of course, as integrated oil companies have built their business model to withstand the ups and downs of a commodity market by having assets spread through the production, refining, and marketing of oil and gas. XOM Total Return Price data by YCharts Just because these companies can be expected to weather the storms relatively well doesn't mean they can be ignored at times like this. In fact, watching what Big Oil does can provide some valuable insight into the full industry's long-term trends. Here are three companies worth watching right now in the integrated oil and gas space. ExxonMobil NYSE:XOM ) : For years, ExxonMobil has been the steady hand of the integrated oil and gas companies. When others ramped up spending while oil prices were high, Exxon's management has practiced temperance. At the same time, it rarely cuts its capital spending budgets simply due to low oil prices. While some investors with a shorter-term time horizon might become frustrated with this behavior, the company has proven itself to be one of the best investments over the long term. XOM Total Return Price data by YCharts We have no idea where oil prices are headed over the next several years. However, there is comfort in knowing ExxonMobil is still generating enough cash from operations to cover all of its capital expenditures, as well as pay for most of its dividend, without taking on debt. The company's debt-to-capital ratio of 13% leaves plenty of wiggle room in the balance sheet to help work through these down times. This is a luxury few companies have at a time like this. Why should you be watching ExxonMobil? Because if it makes significant changes to its current operations it probably means something significant is happening in the market. If Exxon makes a significant change to its capital spending plans, some sweeping changes are probably coming to the industry soon. Chevron NYSE:CVX ) : Chevron has received some harsh criticism lately from analysts such as Goldman Sachs that believe the company will struggle in the next several quarters to lock in the cash flow needed to raise its dividend, and that its production growth plans for 2017 might not be attainable in today's market. While these things are likely to come to pass, there is cause to suspect that such analyst positions are a bit of an overreaction to today's market conditions. Over the two-year time horizon at which Goldman is looking, Chevron has more than $15 billion in major capital projects that cannot simply be stopped due to undulations of oil prices. The vast majority of that capital is tied up in its two LNG facilities in Australia. Projects such as LNG liquefaction terminals involve immense amounts of up-front capital, but once up and running they can be strong cash flow contributors. Simply putting these facilities into operation will mean they are not eating up as much capital spending, and that will help cash flow. Also, with a AA investment-grade credit rating and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.65 times -- which means Chevron's net debt is only 65% of annual EBITDA -- the company has plenty of financial flexibility to pay for these projects without seriously limiting spending or the dividend. The primary thing to watch with Chevron is how well it can complete these projects on time and on budget. It hasn't had the best reputation with that at its Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG facilities thus far, and every extra dollar spent on these projects will eat into long-term profitability. Total NYSE:TOT ) : Total's situation is similar to Chevron's. It has a number of projects under construction that it hopes to bring online in the next couple years. So far, those capital obligations have exceeded its operational cash flow, and that situation is likely made worse with oil prices where they are today. According to Total's most recent investor update, more than 55% of the company's capital employed in the upstream side of the business is in projects under development, which is killing free cash flow and returns. That capital is tied up in about 1.1 million barrels per day of oil equivalent production, all of which management hopes to bring online by the end of 2017. Also, while the company isn't in as good of financial standing as Chevron, it has a decent amount of balance sheet flexibility with an AA- credit rating and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.02 times. As long as Total can keep these projects within their stated budgets, the company should be able to turn around its cash flow issues. Neither it nor Chevron can control what happens with oil and gas prices, and lower prices will certainly hamper profitability. However, when making investment decisions on these major capital projects, these companies cannot be overly concerned with the ups and downs of oil prices and need to focus more on the long-term demand for these commodities as their guide. What a Fool believes Just like the managers of these oil majors, you and I cannot predict which way oil prices winds will blow at any given moment, and to invest based solely on oil prices is an exercise in futility. Investing in integrated oil and gas companies is a bet that they can create shareholder value through the highs and lows of the commodity cycle via dividends, share repurchases, and modest earnings growth. To keep these things going, they all must invest through those cycles. ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Total all can survive these sorts of situations, but investors should watch their ability to move their capital projects along without blowing past budget estimates any more than they already have.

616,MasTec Earnings Get Hit Despite Record Oil and Gas Backlogs -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 16:40:00,"The infrastructure construction company wasn't able to keep up the pace from previous years. May 11, 2015 at 5:40PM Image: MasTec. Energy prices have rebounded sharply from their lowest levels in recent months, but that hasn't been enough to secure the prospects for many companies associated with the sector. As a major infrastructure construction company, MasTec ( NYSE:MTZ ) felt the pinch of the potential loss of energy-related projects, and coming into Monday afternoon's first-quarter financial report, investors thought they were prepared for slowing growth from the company. Yet MasTec's results were even poorer than most had expected, sending shares downward after the announcement and leaving some wondering what's next for the company. Let's take a closer look at how MasTec did in the first quarter and what it says about the company and the industry as a whole. MasTec sees red ink MasTec's first-quarter results weren't entirely gloomy. The company met investor expectations on the revenue front, with gains of about 4% to just over $1 billion. But those greater sales didn't make it down to the bottom line, where MasTec reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $5.6 million, equating to adjusted earnings of $0.07 per share, just a third of what the company post'ed last year and more than a dime below the consensus projections for the quarter. Just as we saw last quarter, the Oil and Gas segment was the primary drag on results, with the segment seeing sales slump 14% to $327.5 million. By contrast, revenue in Communications, Electrical Transmission, and Power Generation all grew, with the latter two enjoying rapid growth paces of between 40% and 60%. Still, when you look at operating profit, only the Communications division managed any growth at all, with Electrical Transmission and Power Generation both losing money in reversing year-ago operating profits. A few one-time items also held back the company's overall results. MasTec said that various one-time non-core charges pushed earnings downward, including about $0.12 per share for costs related to the WesTower integration and an audit-committee investigation and another $0.12 per share from a Canadian wind-farm project. Image: MasTec. Will MasTec bounce back? CEO Jose Mas pointed to several factors holding MasTec back, citing negative impacts from ""adverse weather, a weaker Canadian dollar, the impact of lower commodity prices, and a very difficult Canadian wind farm project."" Still, one surprising aspect of MasTec's results was that oil and gas related backlogs are at record levels of around $870 million, and Mas thinks that the backlog figure will more than double in just the next few quarters. CFO George Pita also mentioned the positive influence from the completion of MasTec's $100 million share repurchase program. Still, with no announcement of plans to authorize further funds, investors might well have been disappointed. Worst of all, MasTec's guidance fell short of what investors had hoped to see. Revenue of $1 billion for the second quarter would be essentially flat sequentially, and that's well below the $1.12 billion that most investors currently expect. Similarly, adjusted earnings of $0.27 to $0.30 per share would fall roughly 20% to 25% below current projections, with the potential for further disappointment. For the full year, revenue projections of $4.4 billion are $200 million to $300 million below previous guidance, and earnings of $1.45 per share would be roughly $0.20 to $0.40 per share lower than initially estimated. MasTec shareholders were displeased with the results, as shares fell almost 7% in the first hour of after-hours trading following the announcement. Despite assurances about backlog figures, MasTec doesn't appear to be ready to ramp up its efforts to get revenue growing at the pace investors want to see. Until the company can stoke its growth fires and get sales rising more quickly, it'll be tough for MasTec to make back some of the ground its stock has lost in the recent past.

Source: Wickipedia. Service companies like Halliburton and Diamond Offshore have been assisting Pemex for years. But, when the exploration and production companies are able to conduct their own operations in Mexico, it'll be the first time that's happened since 1938. Big reserves and smaller production Mexico definitely needs the help : During the past 10 years, the country's output has slid by 25%. As a prime example of these worsening circumstances, the offshore Cantarell field, once the world's second largest, has seen its contribution to Mexican output plummet from 2.1 million barrels per day in 2003 to 400,000 daily barrels last year. Conversely, companies operating in Texas have managed to catapult the state's oil and gas output by 150% during the same period. None of this is to say that Mexico's oil and gas cache has been reduced dramatically. Indeed, conservative estimates peg its oil reserves at about 10 billion barrels and natural gas at about 17 trillion cubic feet. And there are those at the other extreme who are happy to dole out numbers like 60 billion barrels of oil onshore, and another 26 billion barrels in the country's portion of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Three quarters of Mexico's current onshore production occurs in the Chicontepec project northeast of Mexico City. But that's only because the country hasn't really tapped into its substantial resources to the north, between the border with Texas and Veracruz. The South Eagle Ford? You, of course, know about the Eagle Ford Shalein South Texas. Since geology doesn't respect national boundaries, you might expect Mexico's Burgos Basin, just south of the border, to possess similar characteristics. And you'd be right. Pemex has tossed out some possible natural gas reserve numbers for the basin that are so astronomical that I won't repeat them here. South of the Burgos, along the Gulf of Mexico coast, is the Tampico-Mislanta Basin, which is also potentially prolific. The majority of the country's current total production occurs offshore in the Bay of Campeche, north of the Yucatan Peninsula. That body includes the abovementioned and dwindling Cantarell, which I first discussed with Foolsback in 2007. While Pemex has conducted tentative forays into the deepwater, it's likely that companies with experience in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico will have better luck. Ready for the kickoff Once Mexico's legislature completes the secondary terms regarding the contractual arrangements that will govern the foreign companies working there, I expect an influx of major and larger independent companies into the country. However, one of the dangers that will require increased attention beforehand is the presence of the drug cartels and organized crime gangs that tend to congregate to the north, especially in the states along the Texas border. My betting is that the first producing companies to operate in Mexico likely will include the threesome named in the first paragraph above, along with others with experience in the Eagle Ford or the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Indeed, when the legislature first acted, Ali Moshiri, Chevron's head of exploration and production in Latin America and Africa, said, ""I think this reform move has been a tremendous move in the right direction in the Mexican energy industry."" ExxonMobil already has an office in Mexico City. And the company's CEO Rex Tillerson has noted that Exxon hands have begun working with Pemex on some pilot studies, the objective of which is ""so we can get to know each other."" An analyst favorite, Anadarko has skillfully developedsignificance in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, it's been successful off West Africa and Mozambique, and in the Eagle Ford, where its fourth quarter 2013 production increased by 36% year over year. The Foolish bottom line Obviously there will be others. For now, however, the opening of a virtually new frontier for the international oil and gas operators warrants close attention from investors with a bent for energy.

621,Is China's Big Oil Bet Going Bust? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 15:00:00,"Because of its voracious appetite for energy, China risked billions on oil ... and has apparently lost ) Apr 9, 2015 at 4:00PM No pain, no gain, they say, but after betting big on Canada's energy industry, Chinese oil companies have suffered plenty of pain without any commensurate gain. Their wager is going bust, and PetroChina (NYSE: PTR), the Chinese government-owned oil giant, is angling to exit Canada's oil sands market by swapping assets with international industry players. Rivals China Petroleum & Chemical (NYSE: SNP), also known as Sinopec, and CNOOC (NYSE: CEO) have also taken it on the chin because of oil's depressed value with the latter reported to be taking an $842 million impairment related to properties in North America and the North Sea. Alberta's oil sands region hit a gusher of activity, but could become a dry hole as prices crater. Photo: Howl Arts Collectivevia Flickr. A gusher of investment There is no bigger trading partner in Canada's energy industry than China, which has invested tens of billions of dollars in oil and gas assets over the last six years. The nation's investment in the industry might have been higher, but restrictions placed on foreign ownership of Canadian assets in 2012 brought that to a halt such that last year saw virtually no activity in the energy industry. Coupled with long timelines for project development and high costs in Canada, China paid top dollar for many of its assets as the energy sector boomed. CNOOC, for example, in 2013 paid $15.1 billion for Nexen, which valued the oil company's assets at $17 per barrel, compared with the $11 per barrel it paid when it bought OPTI Canada for $2.1 billion the year before. But with oil prices cut in half over the past year, CNOOC might have to write off as much as a third of the investment, or $5 billion. CNOOC has also acquired a 7% interest in Syncrude and has a 12% interest in MEG Energy, an oil sands company in the southern Athabasca region of Alberta. Sinopec paid $4.6 billion for a 9% interest in Syncrude-- a price some analysts believe was $1 billion too much-- which valued the assets at $23 per barrel. China National Petroleum also paid over $5 billion for a joint venture in Encana's Canadian shale gas properties . PetroChina was originally scheduled to buy Athabasca Oil's Dover oil sands project last year for $1.3 billion, but ended up paying less than $1.2 billion and will stretch the payments out over several years. Athabasca recently posted a $129 million fourth-quarter loss and announced it would delay completion of its Duvernay formation project, where PetroChina paid Encana $2.2 billion for a 50% stake in 2012. Gorging on energy Despite an energy market that often seemed uncertain, the Chinese oil majors remained keenly focused on securing long-term supplies of petroleum to feed their country's seemingly insatiable appetite for energy resources. In 2010, Chinese oil and gas companies alone represented about 20% of global merger and acquisition activity in the sector, and both PetroChina and Sinopec planned on spending upward of $36 billion that year on exploration and production investments. CNOOC said at the time it planned on topping the $10 billion it had spent the year before. But five years later, it's a different story. PetroChina is cutting its capital expenditures budget 9% this year from $47 billion to $43 billion, three-quarters of which will be maintenance capex only. Sinopec is cutting its capex budget to $22 billion, a 12% decline from last year, and in February CNOOC said it would reduce capex spending some 26% to 35% this year, the first time in five years that it has reduced this budget item. China National Petroleum declared it is undertaking ""revolutionary measures"" to cut costs. To escape the morass they find themselves in, the Chinese oil majors are looking to restructure their Canadian businesses to minimize further pain. A mad dash for the exits PetroChina said it wants to engage in asset swaps with major international oil companies, acknowledging that depressed oil prices will make it difficult to find a buyer for its Canadian oil sands assets. CNOOC, in addition to its multi-million dollar asset impairment, is eliminating 400 jobs, or 13% of its global workforce, with 340 of the lost positions occurring in North America. It is also closing the Nexen oil trading operation, at a cost of an additional 100 jobs. The Chinese government is even considering consolidating its government-owned oil companies to make them more efficient and competitive. Two ideas floated include merging China National Petroleum and Sinopec, or CNOOC and Sinochem Group. Oil sands are a higher-cost resource to extract that require oil prices be closer to $100 a barrel to just break-even rather than $50, where the commodity currently trades. While older projects can still be profitable below that level -- a recent Financial Post review of Citibank data revealed breakeven points can run as low as $28 a barrel on some projects -- it's the large, newer assets that need oil at just $70, $80, or $90 or more to not induce losses. China remains a massive consumer of energy resources, and oil, which accounts for 20% of China's energy usage, remains key. That helps explain why China made the big bet it did on oil, but Canada ended up enacting tough restrictions on foreign ownership of domestic assets, and the western pipeline capacity expansions that were supposed to bring crude from the oil sands to China have not yet materialized. While intuitively it would seem China's oil giants would rue having gone all-in on one bet, their country's insatiable energy appetite may yet see them make the same wager elsewhere such as in Mexico or Venezuela. If prices rebound that could give them a bigger payoff down the road, but given market expectations that oil prices will remain flat for the foreseeable future even as operating costs rise, their current lower valuations won't seem like such a bargain and another bet will have gone bust.

Express-Times Letters to the Editor My name is Shakira Jackson and Im a student at the University of Pittsburgh. I am also an environmentalist and activist for liberty. I am very worried about President Bidens banon new oil and gas leases. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) the U.S. has achieved energy independence for the first time since 1952. This is essential because it means we dont have to rely on countries with fewer environmental or human rights standards for energy. However, with President Bidens order that could be reversed very soon. Royalties collected on offshore oil and gas leases help fund critical environmental projects through the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) This fund maintains federal public lands and watersincluding funding for our national parks. The National Park Service (NPS) already has a $12 billion maintenance backlog The Great American Outdoors Act will help, but it only provides half the funds needed. It shouldnt be harder to fund projects that protect our nations environment. While banning oil and gas leases may seem environmentally friendly, it will increase our reliance on big polluters abroad. As a young person, I wish we would do better for our environment and reverse this ban.

624,The Energy Report: Signs Of Spring And Rising Oil Demand And Prices,forexpros,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 13:31:54,"Commodities Analysis by Phil Flynn covering: Copper Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures, Natural Gas Futures, Facebook Inc. Read Phil Flynn's latest article on Investing.com report . U.S. production, while creeping up, is still a far cry from its post-pandemic highs. That is leading to empty pipelines. Reuters reports that, By the fourth quarter, total utilization of the largest oil pipelines from the Permian is expected to drop to 57%, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said."" The nadir during the last market bust in 2016 was roughly 70%. U.S. crude output is currently about 11 million bpd and is not expected to grow much until 2022. But more pipelines were already set to come online, growing the gap between production and capacity covered by long-term contracts to a record over 1 million bpd in February, according to energy research firm East Daley Capital. The drilling productivity report from the EIA and as reported by Reuters said that, U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to rise for a third straight month, climbing by about 13,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May to 7.61 million bpd,"" the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Monday. ""The biggest increase is set to come from the Permian, the top-producing basin in the country, where output is expected to rise by 52,000 bpd to about 4.47 million bpd, the highest since April 2020,"" the EIA said in a monthly forecast. Output from other top producing basins, such as, the Bakken and Eagle Ford are expected to slide by 12,000 bpd and 9,000 bpd, respectively. Production in the Bakken basin of North Dakota and Montana is expected to drop to 1.1 million bpd, the lowest since July 2020, according to the data. Fact-checkers on President Joseph Bidens energy policies are back tracking as the truth is that Bidens energy policies have led and will lead to higher prices for gasoline and oil have become clear. Even some analysts that were interviewed by the fact-checkers have reversed their position as the increase and price and the impact on U.S. oil production and investment shifts are now obvious to almost everyone. I was interviewed by fact-checkers from USA Today and laid out the facts why Joe Bidens policies were raising oil and gasoline prices. I was not quoted in the fact check article and the article quoted other analysts without a sense that there was a dissenting voice with real facts to back up my case. That article led Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Twitter to protect Joe Biden by claiming comparisons of gas prices going up due to actions taken by Joe Biden lacked context and were untrue. Bidens recent attack on U.S. oil producers is now trying to tax them out of business by removing tax breaks that all companies get, except not oil and gas companies. Reuters reported that the tax hike for oil and gas is linked to the $2.3 trillion infrastructure package; it is part of a wider plan that includes boosting the corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%. A Treasury Department official estimated that eliminating subsidies for fossil fuel companies would boost government tax receipts by more than $35 billion in the coming decade. The Made in America tax plan did not specify which tax breaks for fossil fuel companies would be targeted. It said the subsidies undermine long-term energy independence and the fight against climate change and harm air and water quality in U.S. communities, especially communities of color. One of the top fossil fuel breaks is called intangible drilling costs, which allows producers to deduct most costs from drilling new wells. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional panel, has estimated that ditching it could generate $13 billion over 10 years according to Reuters. That may mean cash in the governments hand, but the bill is paid by American consumers and businesses. We said that a vote for Joe Biden was a vote for higher energy prices and already that has proven to be true. Fact-checkers need to re-check their facts. From what I have read, some of the oil analysts that they interviewed who said that Bidens policies have not had an impact on higher oil and gas prices have already changed their minds and now are saying that they are raising prices. Now maybe they can stop blocking jokes comparing gas prices under Trump versus Joe Biden because not only are they true, they are also very funny.

Published: Less than an hour ago The UKs net zero law requires the country to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible. Subscribe to our daily newsletter! Sign Up Kwasi Kwarteng Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has rejected calls to bring an end to new licences for North Sea oil and gas as part of efforts to fight climate change. The Government announced a North Sea transition deal with the offshore oil and gas sector last month with targets, and public and private investment, to reduce emissions over the next decade. Ministers also said they would introduce a climate compatibility checkpoint so future oil and gas licences that are awarded are aligned with wider climate objectives, which require cutting UK emissions to net zero by 2050. But the deal was criticised by environmental campaigners for not ruling out new licences for oil and gas, with green groups warning fossil fuels needed to be curbed to meet targets to tackle climate change. The UKs net zero law requires the country to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible, and take steps such as planting trees to absorb any remaining pollution. Quizzed on Tuesday on judging new licensing rounds in the context of climate action by the parliamentary Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee, Mr Kwarteng said it did not make sense to end the industry, having secured the deal. Mr Kwarteng gives evidence to the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee (House of Commons/PA) He said: In the context of having landed a North Sea transition deal just a month ago, it doesnt make sense to essentially scrap all exploration and end the industry by the stroke of a pen, I was really reluctant to do that. I see the North Sea transition, I see the oil and gas sector transitioning to a net zero future, and Im really believing in that. He said the North Sea transition deal was the first time a government in the G7 group of leading industrial nations had done a deal with a sector that had been historically responsible for carbon emissions, to try and wean them off emissions, adding he was very proud of that. He told the committee: But I dont see a world in which a British government essentially by signing off legislation is going to put an abrupt end to what are really important jobs and very skilled people and a very large industry, I dont see that. He said future licensing rounds would be put in the context of cutting emissions, and that electrification of offshore platforms and developing technology to capture carbon were part of the transition deal. He also highlighted funding in the Budget for the shift. We want to work with and help the industry, not shut it down, he said. Sarah Munby, permanent secretary at the Business Department, added that the UKs climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, still saw oil and gas playing a role out to 2050, and it was better for that to be domestically produced than imported.",http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2021/04/13/government-will-not-bring-abrupt-end-to-north-sea-oil-and-gas--kwarteng/

627,Schlumberger Takes Advantage of Oil Prices by Buying Cameron International -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 11:09:00,"Energy math: Low-priced oil equals high-cost mergers. ) felt like spending $15 billion, on this energy edition of Industry Focus. Greetings, Fools! I am Sean O'Reilly joining you here from Fool headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. Today is the energy edition of Industry Focus. As always, I'm joined by Taylor Muckerman and Tyler Crowe. How's it going, guys? Tyler Crowe: Doing pretty good, man. Taylor Muckerman: One of these days, you're going to have to do this show by yourself. O'Reilly: Oh my gosh. I don't even know what I would say. Crowe: It would almost be a dictation of something. O'Reilly: Oil prices that -- hey! Be nice. First up, Schlumberger felt that they needed to buy Cameron ( UNKNOWN:CAM.DL ) for $14.8 billion. They've obviously been doing that joint venture for a little while, so they know each other. Is this a good deal for Schlumberger shareholders? Is this a good deal for Cameron shareholders? Is this a good idea overall? Crowe: Like you said, it's like going from dating to marriage because they had the joint venture going on for a little while in the subsea sector. They had a joint venture called OneSubsea, which was basically a way of trying to get more involved. When you're actually drilling for oil, you have to have those blowout preventers and a lot of safety measurements that are right at the ocean floor. When Schlumberger was going into doing all their contract work for offshore work, they were working almost exclusively with Cameron to do that. By doing this, they've taken out the step of doing it through the joint venture, and they can do it all in a blanket statement. It's a good move if you're looking at offshore as the big-time future over the next 10, 20, 30 years. O'Reilly: Do you think there's an argument for that? Crowe: I think there's any argument for anywhere in oil 10, 20, 30 years from now to be made. Certainly, if you look at the projections... O'Reilly: Drilling for oil on the moon? Crowe: Exactly. If you look at any projection for oil, it appears on that 10- to 20-year time horizon that offshore, more specifically ultra-deep offshore drilling, is going to be a larger and larger component of it. Even with the addition of things like shale over the past couple of years. On that note, it looks like it's a pretty good deal. Everybody may be balking at the price today, saying, ""You guys paid a 50% market premium for this; why are you spending so much?"" Let's keep this in context here. We're looking at an extremely down market. If you compare this to last year, that would basically be Schlumberger buying Cameron at a 10% discount. O'Reilly: Yeah. It was funny to me because Cameron didn't want to give away the house. They didn't want to just give it away. They were obviously in a down market. Were there any significant cost savings that were noted in this deal? Muckerman: I think it was $300 million in the first year after they close and then $600 million in the second year. O'Reilly: So that alone is a pretty good reason to do this. Muckerman: You would imagine so. As Tyler mentioned, they have worked together in the past, so they're just bringing a partner in-house and eliminating some of the costs there. It's a long-term play. Cameron is an offshore company, and of the service companies that are diversified, Schlumberger is one of the more offshore-focused when you look at Halliburton and Baker Hughes. That deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes amplifies their onshore capabilities, whereas this amplifies Schlumberger's offshore capabilities. It's definitely a long-term play. Cameron shareholders are happy today. Any traders, or short-term-minded folks, in Schlumberger probably aren't too excited about this because, other than cost savings, it's probably going to be 2017 or 2018 before this deal's full potential is totally reached. Crowe: In the short term, there might be a bit of share dilution here because Cameron will be getting 10% of an ownership of the new company. Muckerman: I think this is 70% or 75% funded through equity. O'Reilly: Speaking more broadly, oil prices have obviously fallen 60%, and when this whole slide started, everyone thought that the big majors were going to have a bunch of mergers. You had Noble Energy buying Rosetta, and you have a few of the smaller ones. Crowe: The Shell acquisition for $70 billion. O'Reilly: Right. Were you guys expecting more acquisitions and mergers in the interest of cost-cutting? Muckerman: I don't know that I had any expectations, but I definitely wouldn't have been surprised had there been more, even if there are more on the horizon. That's simply because you're looking for flexibility and scale at a time like this. We've been saying that for a while now. Even in a strong market you're looking for flexibility and scale as an investor. I wouldn't be surprised to see a few more of these big players -- and it's going to take a big player in a time like this because a lot of companies are cash-strapped. Crowe: I'm going to speculate a bit with this when I say it -- and please don't take my word as gospel -- I think one thing that could really emerge in terms of mergers is in October banks are going to do a reassessment of the credit lines for a lot of companies in this space. O'Reilly: That's determined by PV-10, which is very dependent on oil prices. Crowe: It's basically how much companies are worth based on their assets and how much it can get financed. Come October, there could be a lot of banks that are looking at some of these more leveraged oil and gas companies and saying they can't fund them like they've been funding them in the past and the risk profile is too high. When we get to that point, I think there's a possibility where some of the companies that are in a better financial position can use that opportunity with a company that is currently in more of a financially strapped position. They'll need to find a way to fund themselves and that could spur a bit more of that merger and acquisition activity. Financing has been pretty accessible throughout this entire downturn so far. O'Reilly: Even in the last six months. Crowe: If the purse strings of the banks start to tighten up a bit, we could see more activity in terms of merger and acquisition. O'Reilly: Got it.

MasTec looks more energetic MasTec's third-quarter results came as a positive surprise for many. Sales skyrocketed by 23% to $1.96 billion, crushing the consensus forecast for just $1.65 billion in revenue for the quarter. Adjusted net income inched higher by just 3% to $68 million, but the $0.82 per share in adjusted earnings was higher than year-ago levels and topped the $0.74 per share that most investors were expecting to see. Performance in the oil and gas segment was the sole contributor to revenue growth at MasTec. Segment revenue climbed by more than half to $1.16 billion, making up almost 60% of MasTec's total sales. By contrast, all of MasTec's other segments suffered declines in revenue, ranging from a 2% drop for the key communications business to larger declines of roughly 20% for the electrical transmission unit and the power generation and industrial segment. From a profit standpoint, the picture was a little different. Adjusted pre-tax operating incomes fell in the oil and gas segment by roughly $10 million, but the company managed to make up those declines with incremental boosts to the bottom line from the other three segments. The electrical transmission business was particularly noteworthy, reversing a year-earlier loss to produce an impressive $8 million swing higher. More modest gains in communications and in the power generation and industrial segment also helped push operating profits higher. Executives at MasTec were excited about how things have gone. ""We had strong third quarter results,"" CEO Jose Mas said, and CFO George Pita echoed those remarks, saying that ""We are proud of our year-to-date performance, including strong cash flow from operations."" What's ahead for MasTec? MasTec sees a lot of potential for growth. ""Since the end of the third quarter,"" Mas said, ""we have received significant amounts of project awards across multiple segments and expect that our year end 2017 backlog will be at record levels exceeding $6 billion."" Those awards should come from across all of its segments, not just in oil and gas. It's likely that acquisitions MasTec made earlier this yearwill play a vital role in meeting expectations on those projects and producing growth. The full potential for MasTec made its way into its guidance for the fourth quarter and for 2017 as a whole. 2017 revenue should be about $6.3 billion, up another $300 million from its previous projection, and adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 would be $0.07 higher than its prior guidance. Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion and earnings of $0.36 per share are actually a bit lower than the consensus forecast among investors right now, but they give the company plenty of room to outperform during the rest of the year. MasTec shareholders have had to deal with choppy movements in the construction specialist's stock price during 2017, and despite economic strength, that volatility is likely to continue until plans from the federal government about infrastructure spending are more fully known. For now, investors should be pleased with the way MasTec is rebounding in energy and can be hopeful that good times will continue for the company.

629,2 Unique Strategies for Playing America's Oil and Gas Boom -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 11:01:00,"America's energy boom is just getting started, and investors have many ways to profit from the bonanza. ) . Hi-Crush Partners is one of my favorite MLPs. With a 4.3% yield and analysts projecting 18.5% annual distribution growth over the next decade (on the back of 23% earnings growth), this is likely to be one of the best income investments in America. What is driving this phenomenal growth? Three words: Bakken, Marcellus, and Utica. These are the three shale formations Hi-Crush is strongest in -- it has three times the distribution centers of its nearest competitors in the Marcellus. Demand for frack sand has been growing at 28.3% annually and is projected to grow at 10.25% CAGR through 2022. This has caused prices of frack sand to climb to $110/ton. Hi-Crush, which sold 1.85 million tons of sand in 2013, is heavily investing in expanding its mining and distribution capacity. For example, on May 22, it opened a new mine in Whitehall, Wisconsin, that will be capable of producing 2.6 million tons of sand per year. This mine is just one of several projects designed to increase capacity from 1.6 million tons to 6.4 million tons per year by the end of 2014 (325% production growth in one year). Hi-Crush recently raised its guidance for 2014 sand sales by 60% (to about 4 million tons), and 2015 guidance of 5 million to 6.4 million tons. With 3.2 million tons of sand contracted for 2014 and 4 million tons for 2015, the MLP is well on its way to achieving its ambitious growth plans. Investors should be further cheered by Hi-Crush's June 17 announcement of a five-year contract with Liberty Oilfield Services, which comes just weeks after news of major contract extensions from Weatherford International and U.S. Well Services. The previous announcements raised Hi-Crush's average contract length from 32 months to four years, but five-year terms are becoming the new normal, creating cash flow predictability that secures the current distribution and sets it up for strong and consistent growth in the future. Eagle Materials is a leading provider of construction materials and oil well concrete that is now breaking into the proppant business in a big way. Management believes its frack sand segment may be worth as much to earnings as its current businesses. Strategically located near the prolific Eagle Ford shale, Eagle Materials' first sand facility will soon be joined by an expansion of its Illinois mine (targeting the Utica shale). The total cost of the mine is expected to be $33 million to $58 million, but it will bring in $4.5 billion over its 45-year projected life span. Analysts estimate 36% margins on frack sand, and with Eagle Materials targeting sand production of 4 million to 5 million tons within two or three years, I feel current analyst estimates of 13% earnings growth (dividend growth 7.5%) over the next decade are likely overly conservative, accounting only for the current concrete and construction business. EXP Total Return Price data by YCharts As the graph illustrates, Eagle Materials (without its frack sand business) has crushed the market with 18.8% annual total returns vs 9.7% for the market over the last 21 years. I am confident Eagle Materials' new, highly profitable and fast-growing business segment will result in even greater results in the future. Foolish takeaway Hi-Crush Partners and Eagle Materials represent two excellent niche providers of vital basic materials powering America's oil and gas boom. Their aggressive growth plans and excellent industry relationships mean patient long-term investors are likely to experience market-beating returns for decades to come.

630,Stocks to Hedge Oil and Gas -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 10:33:00,"Do the crazy swings of oil and gas prices make it hard for you to invest in the space? Here are couple ways to hedge some stability into your portfolio. ) Jul 1, 2015 at 11:33AM Investing in the oil and gas industry is primarily an exercise in determining how much one can stomach volatility. For the 150 years or so that we have been consuming and investing in these commodities, prices have gone on a ride wilder than the craziest of roller coasters: Source: BP outlook of World Energy Factbook. Some investors can bear to watch their portfolios deliver triple-digit gains only to give back more than half of it. For the rest of us, this idea is terrifying. That doesn't mean we need to shy away from the entire industry, though. Instead, we can build hedges into our portfolios to help take the edge off this volatility. No, I'm not talking about buying oil exchange-traded funds or other ways to directly buy oil prices -- those are some of the dumbest ways you can invest in this space Rather, I'm talking about natural hedges in the different parts of the hydrocarbon value chain in which you can invest. Here are four scenarios in which certain investments can help protect your portfolio from being completely whacked on the chin. Falling oil prices: Refiners Few things make a refining company happier than when oil prices fall for an extended period of time. The only way that could be better for them is if crude oil is cheap and in bountiful supply and demand for refined products such as gasoline remains high enough to keep prices for the products up. Refining companies live and die by what is known as the crack spread, or the difference in price between the barrel of crude it processes and the price at which it can sell the refined products. So cheap pricing for its feedstock -- crude oil -- has a tendency to increase crack spreads, and thus operating margins. Two particular companies worth a quick look in the refining space are Holly Frontier and Northern Tier Energy. Both have carved out unique niches in the refining spaceand have set themselves up to succeed in most market conditions, but they really shine when oil prices are falling. Flat oil and gas prices: Pipelines As you can see from the chart above, oil prices are rarely static for very long, and the same can be said for natural gas prices. While natural gas prices haven't always followed oil prices in lockstep, prices have bounced around just as much Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price data by YCharts In those less than common times when oil and gas prices are pretty flat, the companies that grow are those that increase overall production. Sure, this helps the producers, but the greatest beneficiaries from stable oil prices with steady output increases are pipeline operators. Just about all pipeline companies try to isolate themselves from the actual price of commodities by charging fixed fees to use their transportation networks, and periods of flat prices and steady production growth allow these companies to both plan their next pipeline addition to grow revenue and to turn those increasing volume fees into high cash payouts to shareholders. In times of flat prices, those high-paying dividends can make up for a lack of share price growth. Cheap natural gas: LNG exporters and other major gas consumers The proliferation of natural gas production in the United States has opened a whole bunch of industrial opportunities we thought had long gone the way of the dodo. This boom in production, though, has triggered a structural price reset ofnatural gas prices. This has reopened the opportunity for energy-intensive and natural gas-consuming industries to return to the U.S. Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price data by YCharts I can't say with 100% certainty that natural gas will remain at these bargain-basement prices, but a handful of U.S. natural gas producers can eke out some small profits even when natural gas costs about $3 per thousand cubic feet. So while it natural gas might not always be as low as they are today, chances are they won't climb to levels we see in other countries. This translates to a major advantage to companies that consume immense amounts of natural gas. Today, that is mostly chemical manufacturers and power companies, but industry analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimate that by 2020, close to 33% of all domestic natural gas will be used for LNG exports. If these companies can lock in cheap prices, they have a good opportunity to reap some nice profits from selling that same gas abroad. One company that looks to be far and away the largest consumer of natural gas during this time is Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT: LNG). Its two LNG export facilities and partnerships with two others total 60 million tons per year, which would not only make it the nation's largest single consumer of natural gas, but also the largest LNG exporting company by a wide margin. Expensive natural gas: Alternative energy investments such as solar Yeah, I know I just said there is a limited chance of U.S. natural gas becoming really expensive. So let's call this a contingency plan in the event it does happen. Electric power production is the primary consumer of alternative energy today; based on the current costs to manufacture and operate a new power generating facility, natural gas, wind, and solar are the three least expensive options, as seen in this table from analyst group Lazard: Source: Lazard. This means that when companies are choosing their next power generation investment, chances are it will be one of these three choices. This bodes well for utility-scale alternative power manufacturers such as First Solar for solar and General Electric for wind, and there are plenty of compelling reasons to invest in the space today anyways. However, if natural gas prices were to increase significantly -- the chart above assume $4.50 per thousand cubic feet of gas -- it would be an added boost to the economics of alternative energy and could make them even more compelling investments. What a Fool believes The undulating waves of the oil and gas market are enough to make almost anyone seasick. If you can't handle the ups and downs, there are ways to naturally hedge your portfolio. The ideas and companies mentioned above are a decent starting point for creating hedges to other energy investments, and could help settle some of the waves in the storm.

631,The 3 Oil and Gas Stocks to Buy Now -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 10:11:00,"The three very best oil and gas stocks to buy now. Our analyst looks at Devon Energy, EOG Resources, and Pioneer Natural Resources. ) is a top oil stock to buy now. What I like best about Devon Energy is its deep inventory of oil-rich growth opportunities. The inventory continues to grow as the company just bought a top-tier position in the Eagle Ford Shale. That added to its already strong position in the Permian Basin, world-class oil sands operations, and emerging position in several exciting new plays. On top of all that the company is on rock-solid financial footing. It's living within its cash flow, yet still growing its oil production by 20% per year. Add to that its shareholder-friendly management team, which is buying back shares and increasing the dividend, and Devon Energy is one of the top American oil stocks out there these days. Growth at a fair price Another top oil and gas stock to buy is EOG Resources Inc ( NYSE:EOG ) . The company just delivered a stellarquarter as it continues to thrive as a leader of America's oil boom. In my opinion it's just as good as Devon Energy and if anything, the only thing I don't love about EOG Resources is its price, as Devon Energy is cheaper. That said, EOG Resources holds top acreage positions in the three best horizontal oil plays in the U.S. Because of that it's expected to deliver best-in-class crude oil growth through at least 2017. In fact, EOG Resources is expected to grow to become America's top oil producer by 2018, which is impressive for a company that doesn't currently even rank in the top five. In addition to holding positions in the top three oil plays, EOG Resources invests to keep its costs down while also delivering better wells each time it drills. Quite frankly, the profit potential makes it one of the best oil stocks in Americaas the company is simply printing moneyevery time it drills a well.

632,These Risks Could Derail Norways Booming Oil Industry -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 10:00:00,"Energy companies renewed emphasis on cost-cutting and an unfavorable tax environment could greatly reduce investment in Norways booming oil and gas industry. ) Jun 21, 2014 at 11:00AM Oil and gas is big business in Norway. The Scandinavian nation is Europe's top oil producer, the world's third-largest exporter of natural gas, and a key supplier of energy to Europe. Norway's oil and gas industry accounts for nearly a quarter of its GDP and almost a third of government revenue. Spurred by new discoveries in the Norwegian Continental Shelf, oil companies have more than tripled their spending in the country over the past decade. But due to a combination of rising costs, stagnant energy prices, and a challenging regulatory and tax environment, spending is expected to plunge by more than a fifth next year. Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons. Norway oil and gas spending to plummet According to a quarterly survey of oil and gas companies operating in Norway cited by Statistics Norway, oil and gas spending in 2015 will land at 182.4 billion kroner, or $30.4 billion, down from an estimated 231.7 billion kroner in 2014 and marking the first such spending decline since 2010. There are a couple of main reasons for this. One is companies' need to reduce capital spending in the face of operating cost inflation and stagnant commodity prices. For instance, Statoil ( NYSE:EQNR ) , the largest oil producer in Norway, has pledged to slash spending by $5 billion over the next three years and focus on its most profitable opportunities, as part of its strategy to boost cash flow and improve shareholder returns. Similarly, Royal Dutch Shell NYSE:RDS-A ) , another large operator in Norway, plans to reduce its capital budget from a record $44.3 billion in 2013 to roughly $37 billion this year. To improve shareholder returns, the Anglo-Dutch oil major intends to divest some $15 billion worth of assets through 2015, improve its struggling North American shale and downstream businesses, and focus on high-margin oil projects to boost cash flow. High taxes The other big reason why Norway's oil and gas spending is projected to plunge is an unfavorable tax climate that greatly constrains the profitability of some existing fields and marginal new projects. in April 2013, Norway's previous Labor-led government unexpectedly reduced the tax-deductible component of petroleum income and increased its special petroleum tax from 50% to 51%, while maintaining a high overall taxation level of 78%. This move was a key reason why Statoil delayed developing its $15.5 billion Johan Castberg oil field in the Barents Sea. The effective tax increase would add roughly $7 per barrel to Johan Castberg's breakeven cost of development, severely constraining the project's profitability, the company said. The tax increase also prompted Shell to delay its Linnorm field in the Norwegian Sea, which would have produced about 100,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day. While Norway's new Conservative-led administration has proposed to shield certain projects from the previous government's tax increase, some argue that won't be enough. The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, an industry trade group, said the newly proposed rules still risk some 80 billion kroner, or $13 billion, worth of planned projects. The new rules, while not intended to be retroactive, could also apply to new phases of existing projects. For instance, Shell is concerned that its Ormen Lange gas field could be affected. In April, The Hague, Netherlands-based oil major said it would postpone an expansion project at the field, which supplies about a fifth of the U.K.'s gas demand, due in part to higher costs from the tax increase. Investor takeaway As evidenced by Statoil and Shell's decisions to delay certain projects offshore Norway, taxes are a major factor for oil and gas companies in determining how to allocate capital. Coupled with these companies' capital spending reduction targets, high tax rates greatly diminish the economics of some of their Norwegian projects. As such, they're sure to continue focusing capital on other offshore areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, where the operating and tax environment is much more favorable.

637,Could a Disruption in Russian Gas Deliveries to Europe Help U.S. Energy Companies? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 09:32:00,"What's the outlook for Cheniere Energy, Peabody Energy, and Arch Coal? ) is the second-largest coal producer nationwide, and it possesses thermal coal operations in its Central Appalachia mine. The issue with this company is that this thermal coal mine holds high costs and is in secular decline. In fact, Arch Coal is shifting its focus toward metallurgical coal, particularly higher-quality coking coals that hold lower costs compared to other competitors in the region. So, cost-wise, it is debatable whether we would see more coal shipments coming from Arch Coal in the event of higher thermal coal demand. Peabody Energy NYSE:BTU ) has a similar outlook, but it is better positioned than Arch Coal. Its Powder River mine is located in one of the lowest-cost coal mining regions in the world, and its geology allows easier extraction. Hence, Peabody could arrange coal shipments at competitive prices thanks to this abundant, low-sulfur, and ultra-low-cost mine. Final thoughts Russia receives about half of its budget revenue from sales of oil and gas, and rationally speaking, this is a moment in which the country might not be in a position to cut off gas supplies to Europe. But never say never: Russia has applied this strategy before, so stay tuned and be prepared. Regarding gas storage and interconnection, Europe is not in bad shape and is in a better position to handle a gas disruption than before. For example, the region's biggest market, the U.K., has 25% more gas stored than average for this time of the year. Exposure is higher in Germany and especially in Eastern Europe. In the case of a disruption, the U.S. is a bit behind regarding approvals for LNG export facilities, and this could easily benefit Cheniere, which has approved infrastructure functioning already. On the other side of the Atlantic, there is enough capacity to receive shipments since many European LNG import hubs are under-used. The case for Arch Coal is less promising, as the company is positioning itself in the metallurgical coal segment. Its thermal coal business will drive higher profits when gas prices become more expensive in the U.S. Some competitors like Peabody Energy are better positioned and could take advantage of the situation in Europe.

638,"Showdown in Ukraine: Putins Quest for Ports, Oil, Pipelines, and Gas -- The Motley Fool",fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 09:11:00,"Where Russia is involved many in the West believe that one only needs to scratch the surface to see traces of the old Soviet Union begin to resurface. This Week in Energy: How Would LNG Get to Ukraine? Yes, Russia is guilty of meddling in Ukraine, but then again so are the United States and the European Union. The major difference is that far less was said and much less reported by the international media over the Americans' and Europeans' interference than of Russia's actions and the reactions it caused. Where Russia is involved many in the West believe that one only needs to scratch the surface to see traces of the old Soviet Union begin to resurface. After all, Russian President Vladimir Putin is a former KGB officer. The truth is much more complicated than that: or perhaps somewhat simpler. The Cold War that divided the East and West maybe over but the old rivalry still lingers. The rivalry between the West and Russia is no longer one over diverging political philosophies, but purely over resources  and the capitalistic gains they produce from mainly oil, gas and pipelines. The West and in particular the United States seems to be suffering from collective memory disorder and have forgotten all the mud they slapped onto Putin's face during the past 15 or so years. Or at least they expected him to forget and forgive. But then again Russian troops did move in to grab control of Crimea, taking over the territory from the Ukrainians. You can counter that argument by pointing to the US and NATO, who not only interfered, but swallowed former Soviet domains bringing them into the North Atlantic alliance, pushing NATO closer to Russia's borders. Yes, Russia needs access to warm water ports for its Black Sea fleet and many analysts also believe that this is a major issue of concern for Moscow, which it is. But the plot, as they say, thickens. There is also another reason for Putin's intervention in Ukraine and that has to do with Russia elbowing for dominance of the very lucrative and strategically important ""energy corridors."" That is very likely to be the major reason why Putin is willing to risk going to war with the West over Crimea, the pipelines that traverses the Caucasus and the oil and natural gas these pipelines carry westwards to Europe. Given the geography of the region there are only so many lanes where the pipelines can be laid; and most of them transit through Ukraine. Others travel across Azerbaijan and Turkey. Most of Western Europe's gas and much of Eastern Europe's gas travels through Ukraine. If Russia has vested interest in ""recolonizing"" Ukraine, the United States on the other hand has its own interests in Ukraine and other former Soviet areas. What is going on today is nothing short of a race for control of what's going to dominate the energy markets over the next two or three decades: the energy corridors from Central Asia, the Caucuses and through Russia and Ukraine. As stated in a report published by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, ""the proclamation of independence, the adoption of state symbols and a national anthem, the establishment of armed forces and even the presence on Ukrainian territory of nuclear missilesall important elements of independent statehoodamount little if another power, Russia, controls access to fuel without which Ukraine cannot survive economically. That same report denotes that ""Ukraine's strategic location between the main energy producers (Russia and the Caspian Sea area) and consumers in the Eurasian region, its large transit network, and its available underground gas storage capacities,"" make the country ""a potentially crucial player in European energy transit""-a position that will ""grow as Western European demands for Russian and Caspian gas and oil continue to increase."" Ukraine's dependence on Russian energy imports has had ""negative implications for US strategy in the region."" As long as Russia controls the flow of oil and gas it has the upper hand. Russia's Gazprom currently controls almost a fifth of the world's gas reserves. More than half of Ukraine's and nearly 30% of Europe's gas comes from Russia.  Moscow wants to try and keep things going its way; Washington and Brussels find it in their interests to try and alter that by creating multiple channels for central Asian and Caspian oil to flow westwards. Ukraine today finds itself in the center of the new East-West dispute. Ironically, the very assets that make Ukraine an important player in the new geopolitical game being played out between Washington and Moscow is also its greatest disadvantage.

639,T. Boone Pickens: American Drilling Expertise Will Help our Allies More Than Oil & Gas Exports -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 09:05:00,"T. Boone Pickens talks about how American Energy technical capabilities -- not exports of oil and gas -- can help Europe reduce its reliance on Russian gas. ) Jun 19, 2014 at 10:05AM Energy legend T. Boone Pickens isn't a fan of exporting American oil and gas when we are importing millions of barrels every day from countries that are far from friends. Pickens also doesn't see exporting gas to Europe as being the answer to European reliance on Russian natural gas. It's also not a ""quick fix,"" with the first exports not possible before late 2015, when Cheniere Energy's ( ) Sabine Pass Liquefaction plant -- the first of its kind in the U.S. -- begins operation. In the video below, Pickens explains to Motley Fool contributor Jason Hall how American technical know-how is a better asset for our allies to use, to leverage their own domestic resources and reduce dependence on imported oil and gas. Check out the video, or read the transcript below, for more from this energy legend. Jason Hall: The President, for his entire administration, has used the term... T. Boone Pickens ""All of the Above."" Hall: ""All of the above."" Whether we've necessarily seen execution on that policy or not, is another story. This brings up another topic that you've touched on many times, and that is the energy policy in the United States, or lack thereof. Would you share your thoughts on that? T. Boone Pickens: Well, every country in the world has an energy policy, but America. That's it. Why don't we have an energy policy? I can go back to Nixon. Somebody said further back than that. I said, ""probably there, but I can remember Nixon."" He was going to have an energy plan. Every President from Nixon forward has said, ""Elect me and we'll be energy independent,"" but none of them ever gave you an energy plan. The President that was closest to a plan was Carter. Remember, he got in the Fuel Use Act, and he was convinced that America was fast depleting oil and gas reserves, and that we were going to have to rely on the Mideast for our oil. I can't say I didn't agree with him. I thought kind of the same thing. Hall: Well, it happened. Pickens: Yes. We peaked on oil production in the United States in 1970; 10 million barrels a day is what we had, and it declined to 4.5. We're back up to 8.5, and could get back up to 10. That all happened because you had a very aggressive industry that did an excellent job and found, through technology advances, that you could fracture the shales and you could drill the horizontal wells and everything else. But that was our industry, in America, that developed all that. They should get credit for it. How? Just a pat on the back's good enough. There's no prizes or anything else for them, but they're almost criticized or whatever -- when they have done a fantastic job. When I got out of school in '51, 90% of all the oil found around the world had been found by American geologists. Then there were some other companies, foreign companies, that were developed over time. But we're back at the point that the advances that are made, technically, are made by our industry in the United States. You don't ever see anything come out of any other foreign company or anything else. It's the United States that's developed it. Hall: One thing that's played out over the past several years is that a number of foreign companies have bought interests and agreed to joint ventures with American producers, in the U.S. Pickens: That's right. Hall: A lot of my understanding is, it's primarily to try to develop some of that expertise that American energy companies have. Pickens: It is, but the Ukraine/Russian problem that is very recent ... we have politicians get up and say, ""We've got plenty of natural gas. We'll just send it over to Europe. We'll take care of that problem."" Well, no. The first natural gas that will be exported out of the United States will be the Cheniere Energy plant at Lake Charles, Louisiana. It's already under contract. That'll be the first that will go out of the United States, which will be early '16. Hall: Eighteen months from now, essentially. Pickens: Yes. But you're talking about two billion a day -- insignificant on a problem for Europe. But Europe? Hey, tell them, ""We'll help you technically. We can help you on the horizontal, with the fracking and all, but you have shale too."" Europe has shale. You've got France, that says, ""Moratorium. Not going to drill anything."" Okay. ""Hey, that's your problem, fellas."" We don't need to try to solve the problem for Europe. They have shale. Develop your own shale. Hall: That's a position that you've stood on for a number of years; as long as the United States is importing oil, especially from countries that don't really like us very much at all, and what we stand for, it doesn't necessarily make sense to export that commodity. Pickens: None. You have no energy plan, though. Here we are -- all at once we have an abundance. We have more natural gas than any country in the world, and we are in good shape for 100 years on natural gas. We need to decide how this is going to be deployed -- no plan.

640,3 Energy Stocks We Wouldn't Sell If Oil Hit $10 Tomorrow -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 09:00:00,"There are some companies you just hang on to through thick and thin. These three companies fit the bill. Mar 15, 2015 at 10:00AM Image source: TexasRaiser via commons.wikimedia.org. When investing in energy companies, you must be prepared for the occasional price collapse. These past several months have offered a prime example of this danger, but it isn't the first time this has happened. In making long-term investments in this space, you should look for the right companies that can survive a downturn and even (better yet) take advantage of cheap oil. We gave our analysts a hypothetical situation: What company would you hang on to if the price of oil fell all the way to a measly $10? Here is what they said. : One of the most misunderstood things about energy companies is that they don't all rise and fall with the price of oil. Indeed, for refiner Valero Energy ( NYSE:VLO ) , falling oil prices can be a good thing, especially if they come from lower-priced domestic crude supplies that offer a big price differential to other global sources of oil. Valero's strategy in recent years has been to buy relatively cheap U.S. crude oil at a discount, refine it into gasoline and other products, and then sell those products both inside and outside the U.S. market. Because refiners are allowed to export their products freely, the prices Valero gets for selling gasoline and diesel are based on the global market, which have been consistently high. Moreover, demand for those refined products has remained elevated, as low prices have spurred vehicle owners to use more fuel, thus supporting Valero's sales volumes. The main question for Valero isn't so much whether oil drops to $10 but rather whether the spread between domestic and international crude prices narrows. Valero is vulnerable to a disappearing spread, but as long as it can get its feedstock cheaply, it should be able to capitalize on cheap oil well into the future. Jason Hall : Cheap oil prices are hurting many petroleum producers right now, but it's important for investors to remember that demand for oil and oil products is still growing. Furthermore, demand for natural gas and natural gas liquids, or NGLs, is also incredibly strong. With that in mind, investing in companies that gather, transport, and store these commodities is a great way to go. ONEOK NYSE:OKE ) is one of my favorites in the midstream segment, operating as the general partner of master limited partnership ONEOK Partners LP ( ) , which owns the actual pipeline, storage, and gathering assets. ONEOK's business is based on charging fees for transporting and storing products, and not on the actual price of the commodity. In addition, it has long-term contracts that call for minimum volumes and don't fluctuate with gas or oil prices. Think of it like a toll road -- one in which the travelers sign contracts for a decade of use, and agree to pay a minimum toll whether they travel the road or not. The bottom line is this: Demand for natural gas and NGLs is growing. Not only are they a major source of energy for heating and cooking, and used by utilities to produce power, but there is serious demand momentum from chemical companies, transportation, and exports that will further increase demand and production. ONEOK is positioned to benefit from this megatrend, and in a big way. Tyler Crowe: What better place to invest when oil prices hit the skids than in a company that relies almost entirely on the total volume of oil and gas moving through its transportation network. That's why right now I'm looking very hard at adding to my position in Enterprise Products Partners ( ) . Not only do the company's revenue sources give some encouragement to investors -- 85% of total revenue is generated from fixed-contract fees -- but Enterprise's major competitive advantage is its massive transportation and processing infrastructure for natural gas liquids such as propane and butane. These products come from both oil and gas wells, and lower prices for these products mean the company can reap the benefits of cheaper feedstock for its processing and chemical manufacturing facilities. Enterprise also benefits from an investment-grade credit rating and a management team that has shown great ability to maintain a safe coverage of its hefty distribution through several commodity cycles. As long as we're pulling hydrocarbons from the ground in the U.S., Enterprise will almost certainly generate hefty profits no matter what the price of oil.

641,3 Stocks to Watch in Oil and Gas Drilling -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 08:56:00,"Want to get a better feel for the pulse of oil and gas drilling? These three stocks should help you figure it out. NYSE:HP ) -- should be high on your ""stocks to watch"" list. Here's why each of them is worth your time to get to know. Seadrill: It's amazing what market timing can do for a company. A couple years ago, the thirst for oil was high and the prospects for drilling offshore looked mighty strong, particularly in places like Brazil where billions of barrels of oil were waiting to be tapped. Today, though, we are awash with oil thanks to shale drilling, several years of preplanned offshore projects coming online, and OPEC's refusal to lower production rates. We also face a sizable glut of offshore rigs. That excess supply of both oil and rigs is dragging down the dayrates that drilling companies like Seadrill can charge to production companies. That is a pretty precarious position for Seadrill to be in considering its high debt level and large swath of new rigs that are still under construction. However, Seadrill benefits from having one of the youngest fleets in the business, as companies looking to rent rigs will more likely go with newer ones. So Seadrill should at least keep a decent amount of rigs employed, if not at the most favorable rates. Also, with so many fresher rigs, the company is not subject to large numbers of rig retirements like so many of its peers. If you are looking at the long-term potential of offshore drilling -- and it does look promising if you peer out several years -- then Seadrill is likely a stock to watch. But you will probably need to be patient because it could take a while for things to tun around. Transocean: Pretty much everything I said about market dynamics related to Seadrill also applies to Transocean. After all, they are both major players in the offshore drilling space. The major difference is that Transocean has a fairly large fleet of older rigs. These rigs are becoming less and less economically viable as they age and as newer rigs hit the open water, and so will likely need to be retired. This painful process is under way: So far this year Transocean has announced the retirement of 19 older rigs. As these older rigs come off the books, the process should do two things: 1) It should reduce the costs associated with maintaining idled rigs that don't have contracts;  2) removing rigs from the market should help clear the glut and drive up demand for newer rigs, which in turn should increase dayrates. The speed at which Transocean retires rigs will play a large part in how long this industry downturn lasts. The faster Transocean and its peers  pull the plug on older fleets, the faster the recovery. Helmerich & Payne: Transocean and Seadrill are bellwethers of the global oil and gas market largely because most offshore drilling involves what is known as the marginal cost barrels -- the cost to bring the last barrel of oil online to meet current demand. What we have seen over the past several years thanks to shale drilling and the restriction on exporting oil from the U.S., though, is that the domestic market and the international markets for oil don't necessarily behave in the same way. A company that is worth watching if you want a pulse of the U.S. market is Helmerich & Payne. Of the near 400 rigs owned by Helmerich & Payne, more than 88% are used in the U.S. land market; over the past several quarters those rigs have generated more than 80% of companywide revenue. According to the Helmerich & Payne's latest earnings report, just under half of the company's U.S. land-based rigs were under contract, which is largely pretty indicative of the overall trend in land rigs here. As prices for oil and gas climb and producers become a little less shy about drilling, Helmerich & Payne should do very well. This is because many of its idled rigs are capable of doing the tougher drilling jobs associated with hydraulic fracturing. Also, considering the company has remained profitable during this down cycle. it shouldn't have many issues weathering the storm until the industry picks up. What a Fool believes Energy investing requires a certain temperament that can look beyond the undulating waves of the cyclical commodity market. When it comes to oil and gas drilling, it is particularly tough because companies in this space can get hit with the double-whammy of declining rig utilization and declining contract rates for rigs still in use. To keep track of what is happening in the market for oil and gas drilling, Seadrill, Transocean, and Helmerich & Payne are as good of indicators as any. Depending on your tolerance for short-term pain they might also be the companies to put on your personal investing radar.

642,Oil and Gas Investor Post Bankruptcy Strategies: The Great Wipeout,hartenergy,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 08:00:00,"In 2020, companies entered bankruptcy after a sudden plunge in oil and gas prices and, unlike the downturn six years ago, many emerged with nearly pristine balance sheets. But for what end? Oil and Gas Investor Tue, 04/13/2021 - 03:00 AM [Editor's note: A version of this story appears in the April 2021 issue of Oil and Gas Investor magazine.] The mileage had already worn smooth companies such as Oasis Petroleum Inc., Whiting Petroleum Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. before 2020 and what was to come: an E&P demolition derby. The companies were plagued to varying degrees by huge amounts of debt and, abruptly, vanishing cash flow. Combined, the companies were saddled with $15.2 billion. But in less than a year, like the sly rolling back of a debt odometer, the three marquee names owed just $1.9 billion. Their secret? Bankruptcy. After years of chipping away at their debt, the sudden drop in commodity prices last year pushed the companies off the stock exchanges, miniaturized market values and, finally, forced E&Ps to yield to the courts.

643,"Wanted: New legal regime for oil, gas",thenationonlineng,"Apr 13, 2021",2021-04-13 07:36:18,"Strengthening the legal and regulatory framework of the oil and gas sector was the thrust of the fourth oil and gas law conference... Strengthening the legal and regulatory framework of the oil and gas sector was the thrust of the fourth oil and gas law conference, reports JOSEPH JIBUEZE . Will the Petroleum Industrial Bill (PIB) ever become law? An energy law expert, Prof Yinka Omorogbe, believes the sooner the law is passed, the better for the country. The PIB, she noted, has been pending for over 12 years. But, in her view, Nigeria has stayed static for much longer with regards to the legal status of the oil and gas sector. Last November, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said the PIB would be passed by March. This has not happened. Omorogbe described the extant oil and gas legal regime as obsolete and outdated, noting that the PIB has been pending since 2007. She spoke at the fourth Lawyers in Oil and Gas Conference and Industry Awards in Lagos, organised by the Lawyers in Oil and Gas Network. Its theme was: Nigerias Oil and Gas future: Law, policy, regulation. Tracing the trajectory of the PIB, Omorogbe recounted that between 2007 and 2011, after the President submitted the bill to the National Assembly and it was gazetted, various drafts emerged under the auspices of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The bill eventually went through the third reading at both the House of Representatives and the Senate but was not passed. Between 2011 and 2015, the professor said the drafting of the bill recommenced, after which the PIB 2012 was submitted to the National Assembly. It never passed the third reading at the House even after further amendments. According to her, another drafting recommenced, with four sets of bills emerging. The President withheld assent to one of them  the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill. Will there be another version of this Bill after 2023? We may be waiting, but the world is not, she said. Omorogbe believes there is the need to pass the bill without further delay as the law that regulates the sector is not in alignment with international best practice. Besides, she said the extant law is opaque, lacking transparency, lacking good governance practices and processes and is not in the interests of Nigeria. The PIB has mutated over the years. The latest variant is a throwback to the original one, in that it is one omnibus law. It is comparably lean, with three main institutions and a minister. There are likely to be major changes as it passes through the National Assembly. Watch out for your position! May it finally pass before 2023, Omorogbe said. The conference, which had three sessions, featured energy law experts and major players in the oil and gas sector. Improve local content Experts also spoke on the need to improve the local content policy. Managing Director of AOS Orwell, an oil service firm, Femi Omotayo, called for close monitoring of the local content policy implementation and enforcement. This, he said, is to ensure its efficacy towards value addition and backward integration. On how to achieve these, he urged the government to continue with the provision of infrastructure facilities as well as single-digit financing to the sector. He also urged the government to extend awareness on how to access financing. Omotayo called for the harmonisation of laws that promote local production and the promotion of policies that will enhance competitiveness. An energy consultant, Dr Wisdom Enang, welcomed the prospect of expanding the scope of the local content policy within and beyond the oil and gas sector. He, however, said standards must never be compromised. Actualising the goals of the Nigerian local content policy cannot be at the expense of quality. As such, indigenous companies must continue to invest in improving the quality of their products and services, and deliver same to the Nigerian market at competitive prices, Enang said. At partner at Olaniwun Ajayi LP, Tominiyi Owolabi, speaking on financing for large gas projects, said Nigerias financial institutions do not have the liquidity to support the foreign exchange required for such transactions. He explained that though Nigeria has the largest gas reserve in the continent and the eighth largest in the world, developing the gas sector requires significant funding on all activities involved in the gas value chain, from processing to transportation and storage, among others. Major issues involved in sourcing for funds are the cost of financing itself. Project sponsors should make use of a bankable structure for record purposes. We also need to look into offshore funding, he suggested. Viability of mass metering The Federal Government, last October, launched the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP). It was borne out of the need to bridge the metering gap, as it is estimated that about 6.25 million customers are still unmetered. Head, Legal and Regulations of Ikeja Electric, Babatunde Osadare, who represented the Managing Director, Folake Soetan, urged stakeholders to closely work together to ensure NMMPs objectives are effectively achieved. ADVERTISEMENT For example, the funds must be timely disbursed; meters must be delivered and installed timeously; sufficient personnel must be provided by the MAPs for meter installation; there must be continuous sensitisation of customer by the DisCos; etc. Furthermore, the transition or interplay between the MAP Regulation and the NMMP must be carefully managed to avoid legal pitfalls. It is widely known that some investments have already been made by the Meter Asset Providers (MAPs) before the initiation of the NMMP policy. The Regulator in this regard is already working with all stakeholders on how to seamlessly manage the two metering regimes. The financial intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the metering challenges of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) is a laudable initiative. It is aimed at growing the local meter manufacturing sector thereby creating more job opportunities and supporting Nigerias economic recovery while bridging the metering gap in the NESI. However, all NESI stakeholders must work in alignment to achieve the desired objectives, Osadare said. The event also featured award presentations to major oil and gas players in recognition of services to the development of the energy industry. Among those honoured were Chief Sylva, NNPC Group Managing Director Mele Kyari, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Prof Omorogbe, a former Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Section on Business Law (SBL) Mr George Etomi, Technical Adviser (TA) on Gas Business & Policy Implementation to Sylva, Mr Justice Derefaka, among others.",https://thenationonlineng.net/wanted-new-legal-regime-for-oil-gas/

655,4 More Oil and Gas Companies With Monthly Dividends -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 23:00:00,"Finding a monthly-dividend payer provides flexibility to grow your portfolio or meet monthly obligations. Source: Yahoo! Finance. What's a royalty trust? All four companies on the list are royalty trusts. A royalty trust is similar to a REIT but instead of real estate or mortgages, income is derived from oil and gas rights. With this special situation, however, comes special tax reporting requirements, so be aware of that prior to purchasing royalty trusts. They also deplete over time, so the income is not guaranteed to last beyond the life of the trust. Cross Timbers and Hugoton Royalty Trusts both provide investors with profits from the natural gas producing assets of XTO Energy, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, which purchased XTO in 2010 to add to its natural-gas-producing assets in North America. Sabine Royalty Trust provides income from the properties of Sabine Corporation in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. The trust has been making monthly distributions since January 1988. Oh, Canada! Like Baytex Energy and Provident Energy, which I mentioned last time, Pengrowth Energy is a Canadian company slightly different from the U.S.-based trusts on this list. While it pays proceeds similar to a traditional royalty trust, it also focuses on the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Its largest production comes from locations in the Montney and Horn River shale areas in northeastern British Columbia and western Alberta. Dividends are great Though these aren't dividend payers in the traditional sense, their monthly dividend-like distributions could be used to pay some monthly expenses.

Partly in thanks to the fierce competition therein, the company has had little success in the segment and it currently contributes only about 2.9% to Wipro's total revenues. Cognizant, on the other hand, earns about 10% to 12% from its standalone consulting business. In a quest for new vertical markets that it can develop a stronger presence in -- and looking to match growth of its key competitors -- Wipro is moving forward with a bold acquisition plan. Wipro's oil ambitions With SAIC's significant domain capabilities in the areas of digital oil field, petro-technical data management, and petroleum application services, Wipro gets a chance to cater to the upstream segment as well and grab a share of the $19 billon U.S. market for upstream information technology solutions. Oil companies investing in the upstream business must also invest in associated IT services, and that's where Wipro comes in. Wipro's upstream IT business will now contribute an expected 17.5% to its energy, natural resources, and utilities business revenues, up from just 5% previously. Fortunately, this type of work isn't entire unfamiliar to Wipro. In fact, the company has extensive experience in implementing solutions on the Microsoft platform for the larger energy and utilities industry. A new market in a new market Wipro has a comparatively low exposure to the U.S. market, with 55.9% of total business revenue coming from there. That's in contrast to Infosys (Nasdaq: INFY) and Cognizant, which generate 65.8% and 77.7% of their revenues from these markets, respectively. An acquisition of SAIC's oil and gas technology unit will help Wipro to enhance its exposure to U.S. markets. The greater Foolish question: Why was SAIC interested in selling this business asset? What does SAIC have to say? SAIC says the sale of this asset is in sync with its plans to better focus on strategic growth areas. This includes energy segments such as smart grid, renewable energy implementation, and energy efficiency. The company feels investments in oil and gas IT services business would have diverted from its area of focus. What do Fools say? Wipro has been quite aggressive in making acquisitions to grow its business. Better yet, a return to higher IT spending and an improvement in the U.S. economy should trigger improved economics for the company in months and years to come. However, on the flip side, the company still trades for 21 times earnings, so growth will have to continue at a high rate if the company wants justify a higher multiple than established IT brands like IBM or Accenture.

657,Big Oil Aims To Win Back Investors With Green Oil,oilprice,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 23:00:00,"Oil majors are rushing to reduce the carbon intensity of their production while trying to keep up production levels, an untested, but potentially successful strategy Last month, the Biden administration dealt the fossil fuel industry yet another blow after it proposed the introduction of a carbon tax in a bid to address the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy went to great lengths to make it clear that the Biden Administration is not fighting the oil and gas sector, but rather wants to deploy emissions reduction technologies to create union jobs, fuel the American economy and strengthen American manufacturing.  Interestingly, executives from 10 of the biggest oil and gas companies, including CEOs of Exxon Mobil NYSEXOM and Chevron NYSECVX, bought into Biden's plan with Occidental NYSEOXY CEO Vicki Hollub being the only high-profile dissenter.  Why is this important Because it has probably sounded the death knell for high-carbon industries such as coal.  According to S&P Global Platts, coal's current 21% share of the generation mix is likely to fall to just 5% by 2030, assuming that a federal carbon price starts in 2026 while wind and solar generation could increase from the current 11% of the generation mix to 30% in 2030.  Indeed, mothballing half of the country's coal-burning electricity plants will open the doors for 122,000 megawatts of wind and solar while also cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 600 million metric tons by 2025.  An aggressive push towards 100% clean energy could also save Americans as much as $321 billion in energy costs, according to a new study.  Related Saudi Arabias Breakeven Oil Price To Drop To $65 Next Year  Hardly surprisingly, Big Oil executives have come up with a radically different solution Greening their operations without necessarily sacrificing oil and gas output.  Lowering emissions, not nixing fossil fuels  Speaking at last month's CERAWeek by IHS Markit energy conference, the overriding theme that emerged at the conference is that Big Oil wants to focus not so much on curtailing oil and gas production but rather on mitigating the impact of its carbon and greenhouse gas emissions.  According to Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods and Occidental Petroleum's Vicky Hollub, reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuelsand not the actual use of fossil fuelsoffers the best way to combat climate change.  Interestingly, both CEOs have stressed that the world still needs oil and gas, and governments need to focus on mitigating global warming using technologies such as carbon capture and storage CCS instead of attacking fossil fuels.  Nevertheless, even the biggest hardliner of them all, Exxon Mobil, has markedly changed its tune from just a few years back.  During the company's 2021 Investor Day, CEO Darren Woods outlined the company's energy transition strategy, including plans to trim production growth and boost cash flows in a bid to support a growing dividend. Exxon revealed that it plans to hold production flat from 2020 levels through 2025 at 3.7M boe/day, good for a 26% cut from the 5M boe/day estimate for 2025 it released just a year ago.  Still, Exxon plans to continue ramping up production at the Permian Basin and Guyana, with Permian production averaging 400K boe/day this year before rising to 700K boe/day by 2025. Exxon also sees Guyana quickly becoming a key cash cow, but has indefinitely suspended other major projects such as the $30B Mozambique LNG export project.  Related Two Reasons Why Gasoline Prices Are Soaring  Woods announced plans to increase investments on carbon capture and storage to 3% of new spending, an improvement from the 1% it had previously earmarked for CCS but still a far cry from the double-digit levels from European majors Total SE NYSETOT and Royal Dutch Shell NYSERDS.A. Woods urged governments to stop picking winners and losers but instead establish carbon markets so as to ""make sure we're using market forces to try to most cost effectively reduce CO2 emissions.""  Deep-pocketed investors are not buying it.  The 145-member Coalition for a Responsible Exxon that oversees $2.5T in assets said that Exxon Mobil must change direction and not merely appoint new board candidates.  Occidental Petroleum's Vicky Hollub pretty much echoed Darren Woods' views  ""What I think that people don't understand is we should not be talking about eliminating fossil fuels. What we really need to be talking about is eliminating emissions and if we can provide and we will. Net carbon zero oil, that is what the world needs and the world cannot achieve the goals ... of the Paris accord without the oil industry helping with that. We can be leaders in that.""  Hollub said OXY's goal was to not only become a net-zero oil producer but also help other companies lower their carbon footprint  ""We're going to be building what will be the largest direct air capture facility in the Permian and partnering with us to do that is United Airlines because they also have a commitment and focus on getting to net zero by 2050.""  Hollub revealed that Occidental has signed up to take carbon from two ethanol plants and a steel plant in Colorado and sequester it in the Permian Basin.  Last week, Occidental Petroleum announced that its Oxy Low Carbon Ventures subsidiary plans to build and operate a bio-ethylene pilot plant that will apply technology using human-made carbon dioxide instead of hydrocarbon-sourced feedstocks.  Bio-ethylene is currently produced from bio-ethanol mainly derived from sugarcane. The pilot plant is expected to begin operations in 2022.  OXY is also against a carbon tax  ""A carbon tax would be bad for a lot of the industry, a carbon tax would be bad for the consumers and especially for those consumers who are more disadvantaged from an economic standpoint,"" OXY's CEO told a virtual summit of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association.  OXY has become the quintessential poster-child of an M&A deal gone bad after its $55B acquisition of Anadarko left it saddled with a massive $38.5 billion debt pile.  A fight for survival  Stewart Glickman, CFRA energy analyst, says Big Oil is spending a lot of time marketing its efforts on a low carbon future and technologies such as carbon capture because they are literally embroiled in a fight for survival.  In 2020 alone, ESG funds attracted $51.1 billion of new money, and not having a low-carbon strategy in these times is a recipe for disaster.  Sure, fossil fuel investors still want to hear the usual things How healthy is your balance sheet Can you sustain your dividend What's your operating cash flow look like Can you maintain the production you want without spending too heavily on capex  These considerations will always be paramount. But in the same breath, they also want to hear about your investment in renewables and low carbon solutions businesses. And changing a few board seats no longer cuts it.  So far, oil and gas companies appear to be doing a good job placating jittery investors, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE up 26.2% vs. 9.8% YTD gain by the S&P 500.

658,Why Hedging Oil and Gas Production Matters,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 19:00:00,"Is your energy investment hedged enough? Let's take a look at why hedging matters. Why Hedging Oil and Gas Production Matters Is your energy investment hedged enough? Let's take a look at why hedging matters. Matthew DiLallo Jun 28, 2013 at 8:00PM To hedge, or not to hedge? That is the question many oil and gas companies ask themselves each and every day. By hedging, or locking in future oil and gas prices, a company is giving up the future upside in exchange for certainty. As you will soon see, for some oil and gas companies, hedging is the life blood that keeps the company going. As you know, oil and natural gas prices can be very volatile. That volatility can really impact a company's profitability as well as its ability to plan for the future. That's why some companies want absolutely no uncertainty, and will hedge 100% of future production for many years into the future. Others feel that investors want full access to the upside of commodity prices, and won't hedge any production. Both models can make producers look brilliant depending on what commodity prices are doing at that moment. Companies that hedge over the long-term can end up doing very well. This is really clearly seen when looking at an oil and gas MLP like Legacy Reserves ( NASDAQ:LGCY ) . The following chart does a great job of showing its annual revenues with and without the impact of its hedging program: Source: Legacy Reserves Investor Presentation As you can see, hedging its oil and gas volumes had a negative effect on the company's revenue in 2008, which, if you'll remember, was the year that oil and gas prices really shot higher. However, the company was well protected as that bubble burst, which enabled it to consistently grow its revenue during that period of volatility. Legacy typically hedges 85% of its production looking out over the next two years, while hedging a declining portion of its production after that. That's well below LINN Energy ( OTC:LINEQ ) , which will hedge 100% of its production out four to six years. As you can see from the following chart, LINN is well above both its upstream peers like Legacy, as well as C-Corps: Source: LINN Energy Investor Presentation Overall, hedging has helped both LINN and Legacy to keep distribution payments to investors stable during the financial crisis when many companies were slashing payouts. That's one reason why it matters much more to these MLP's than it would for an E&P company like Chesapeake Energy ( NYSE:CHK ) . That being said, Chesapeake is very well hedged this year because it needs to ensure its cash flow in order to fund its growth. Because the company really can't take on the risk of commodity prices collapsing this year, its hedged 78% of its natural gas production, as well as 88% of its oil production. That's locked in its operating cash flow to a range of $5.05 billion to $5.32 billion. Because of its tight financial situation, the company made the decision that certainty is worth more than upside at the moment. Ultra Petroleum NASDAQ:UPL ) also uses hedges to provide certainty to its cash flow. The company has hedged 81.4 billion cubic feet of production through the end of this year. That equates to about half of its production in the next two quarters, and about a quarter of its fourth-quarter production. Ultra is doing this in order to generate the cash flow that's required to meet its capital budget. That will enable the company to drill about 80 wells this year so that it can grow its overall production to between 228 Bcfe and 238 Bcfe, all while staying within the confines of its cash flow. If the company didn't secure its cash flow by hedging, it wouldn't be able to grow as fast if natural gas prices plummet this year. As you can see, hedging oil and gas production is very important to energy companies. It's even more important to those companies that really need to ensure stable cash flow to either pay investors steady income, or to continue growing. While these companies are giving up the upside, there is something to be said for income certainty.

659,The Best Dividends in Energy,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 19:00:00,"Four stocks with dividends that pay for the long term. ) Mar 12, 2013 at 8:00PM Stable dividends can be an investor's best friend and the energy sector is one of the most stable for supplying those dividends. Energy usage on all levels varies very little from year to year and regulated markets can provide very stable businesses for investors. With that in mind, I've assembled a list of five companies that supply great dividends that I think will be stable in the long term. Seadrill NYSE:SDRL ) Oil drilling can be a very volatile business. A better than expected well can send your stock through the roof and a dry well can send your stock crashing down. But supplying equipment to a growing market can be extremely stable and lucrative. Right now, one of the best equipment businesses in offshore drilling, and even more specifically ultra-deepwater offshore drilling, is Seadrill. The company owns a large fleet of deepwater rigs and has 22 more rigs under construction seven of which are ultra-deepwater drillships. This will be a stable business because of the overall trends in the oil market. Oil is harder and harder to find both onshore and offshore, so drillers are going to greater lengths to find it. That's led companies to oil fields in water up to two miles deep off the coasts of the U.S., Brazil, Africa, and other parts of the world. As more drilling takes place, more oil is found, creating a reinforcing loop for ultra-deepwater rig owners. For shareholders, Seadrill trades at just 10 times this year's earnings estimates, and with new rigs coming online over the next few years, profits should continue to grow. The stock's 9% dividend yield is among the highest on the market, but I think it's safe in this growing energy market. Kinder Morgan NYSE:KMI ) Another play on the energy market that's safer than betting on explorers is with the companies transporting oil and gas from place to place. Kinder Morgan owns oil and gas pipelines, processing stations, terminals, and other energy assets. The company makes money by moving oil and gas from processing sites to refiners, in many cases in regulated markets, providing stable returns. As shale production in the U.S. increases there will be expanded opportunities for Kinder Morgan to grow and diversify its assets. The stock pays a 4% dividend yield; with the stability of the oil and gas markets investors can count on payouts for a long time to come. Another way to play this company is with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners ( UNKNOWN:KMP.DL ) , which pays a 6% dividend yield. The difference is, Kinder Morgan Partners is an MLP so it has different tax consequences than its parent Kinder Morgan, something you can learn more about here Total NYSE:TOT ) In the oil production space, Total is one of the biggest players and it is well-positioned for a changing energy landscape in the future. The company is one of the largest players in liquefied natural gas, supplying an increasing amount of the energy to Asia. It is also majority owner of solar leader SunPower, which gives it a foothold in an emerging part of renewable energy. Total's stock trades at just 8.4 times trailing earnings and investors get a 5.4% dividend yield to go along with it. Hawaiian Electric Industries NYSE:HE ) What would an energy dividend article be without at least one utility? For my utility pick I'm going halfway across the Pacific Ocean to the company supplying 95% of Hawaii's population with electricity, Hawaiian Electric Industries. Below, you can see that even through the financial crisis the company made a profit for shareholders and has picked up returns recently:",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/03/12/the-best-dividends-in-energy.aspx
660,Dynamic Materials Keeps Waiting for an Oil and Gas Rebound -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 18:35:00,"The explosives-maker suffered another tough quarter as energy stayed weak. Jul 28, 2015 at 7:35PM Energy, Materials, and Utilities Follow @@DanCaplinger Image: Dynamic Materials. A wide variety of companies depend on the health of the energy industry, and explosives specialist Dynamic Materials ( NASDAQ:BOOM ) enjoyed the success of the oil and gas boom for years. Yet the plunge in energy prices over the past year have hurt the prospects of companies throughout the industry, and coming into Tuesday afternoon's second-quarter report, Dynamic Materials investors were reluctant to predict just how far the company's fortunes could fall before crude oil finally spurred its customers to start spending on its products again. At least for now, Dynamic Materials continues to see substantial declines from energy's weakness, and it can only hope to contain the damage as it looks for other avenues to growth. Let's look more closely at Dynamic Materials and what could lie ahead for the company. Dynamic Materials continues to sink As we've seen in past quarters, Dynamic Materials' second-quarter results came as a disappointment to many investors. Revenue dropped 14% to $44.7 million, and even though the company noted that the drop was less severe than the 15% to 20% decline implied by its previous guidance, investors had hoped for a slightly better number. An unexpected adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $356,000 reversed a substantial profit in the year-earlier period, and the per-share loss of $0.03 was more than a dime per share lower than the $0.08 per share of earnings that investors had wanted to see. That marked the second quarter in a row that investors have had to deal with red ink on Dynamic Materials' bottom line. Unlike what the company has seen in past quarters, the weakness at Dynamic Materials came fairly consistently from its two main segments. The DynaEnergetics unit, which provides oilfield services for clients, took a 9% hit to its sales compared to last year's second quarter, with the majority of the drop coming from the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. Operating income plunged by more than half, with the company blaming higher commission expenses and client purchases of less profitable products, along with higher costs of advertising and marketing. The NobelClad explosive-metalworking division also took a big hit, with sales plunging 18% only in part because of falling foreign currencies. Delayed shipments and weak capital spending among its customers also contributed to the revenue declines, and operating income fell by nearly 70% year-over-year. CEO Kevin Longe tried to emphasize the successes that Dynamic Materials has seen during this tough period. ""In the face of challenging market conditions,"" Longe said, ""both of our businesses achieved important strategic and operational objectives during the second quarter."" Between the new DynaStage factory-assembled perforating system to reduce cost and increase performance and the new NobelClad manufacturing facility in Germany, Dynamic Materials believes that the investments it has made in its future growth will pay off eventually. Waiting out a long decline For now, though, Dynamic Materials sees tough conditions continuing at least for the remainder of the year. For the third quarter, the company believes that sales will fall 8% to 12%, matching the decline in full-year 2015 revenue that Dynamic Materials issued as guidance earlier this year and reiterated in this quarter's report. Gross margins could fall as much as two percentage points in the third quarter, and that will make it even harder for the company to restore its profitability. Moreover, Dynamic Materials is facing a regulatory inquiry at a terrible time. Last month, Customs officials sought to impose anti-dumping import regulations on some of its steel mechanical tubing, requesting a $1.1 million cash deposit. The company will post a bond or make appropriate cash deposits this quarter, but Dynamic Materials hopes that future administrative proceedings will keep the company from having to pay duties in the future. Dynamic Materials' results should come as no surprise to investors, and the small-cap stock didn't inspire traders to make big moves in the after-market session following the announcement. The real key is how long poor conditions in the energy sector hold back drilling and other activity among exploration and production companies. The sooner things get back to normal in the sector, the sooner Dynamic Materials can start using its expertise to produce earnings growth.

Historically speaking, there have been five major metrics that contribute to long-term total returns: yield, distribution growth, distribution safety, valuation, and volatility. After investigating all the major upstream MLPs in the industry, I thought readers may enjoy a final article that ranks these income titans by the thing long-term investors treasure most: expected long-term total returns.

The change makes QuickSilver's Q4 net loss just $548 million, as opposed to the previously reported $1.1 billion. The change also makes the company's full year loss just $2.4 billion, down from a loss of $2.5 billion. While the changes make Q4 net income look better, they're just a change in accounting, and as the company states in its report, ""All adjustments described above are non-cash."" With a large debt load and questionable ability to continue for the long run I'd pass on Quicksilver Resources.

663,An Investor's Guide to Midstream Oil and Gas,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 16:07:00,"An in-depth look at the midstream sector of the oil and gas industry. An Investor's Guide to Midstream Oil and Gas An in-depth look at the midstream sector of the oil and gas industry. Matthew DiLallo Updated: Aug 28, 2019 at 5:03PM The midstream sector is one of the three links in the oil and gas value chain, which encompasses companies that work together to help a market operate efficiently. In energy, the value chain takes hydrocarbons produced at the wellhead (upstream) and moves them (midstream) to end users (downstream). Activities in the midstream industry include transportation, processing, storing, and marketing hydrocarbons such as natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Each one of these energy commodities has its own linked set of midstream assets designed to maximize the value of every barrel that comes out of the ground. The midstream sector is an important one not only to support the infrastructure needs of the oil and gas industry but also for investors. Midstream stocks leverage their crucial role in the energy sector to produce lots of cash flow, which affords them the ability to pay high-yielding dividends That's why income-seeking investors will want to get to know this important sector. Image source: Getty Images. The midstream oil and gas sector 101 The midstream sector serves a vital role in the oil and gas industry by helping transport and transform raw hydrocarbons produced by a well into usable materials for refineries and petrochemical plants. The midstream sector has three main components: gathering and processing, transportation, and storage and logistics. It all starts upstream at a wellhead. After drilling a well, an oil and gas company (or a third party) will often construct a pipeline that will gather the raw hydrocarbons produced from that well and others. The raw hydrocarbons will then flow into a central facility that will store, process, and separate the various hydrocarbons. Then, the processed liquids will flow further downstream by pipeline, truck, tanker, and rail for additional storage and processing before ultimately reaching their downstream destination. Several types of companies operate in the midstream sector: integrated oil companies, sponsored midstream companies, and independent midstream companies. Integrated oil companies operate across the entire energy market value stream -- including the midstream sector -- so that they can maximize the value of every barrel they produce. In addition to integrated oil companies, there are also two types of ""pure-play"" midstream companies. Some oil and gas producers have created separate, publicly traded midstream companies that operate across the midstream value chain, serving the needs of the parent company, as well as those of third-party customers. Meanwhile, independent midstream-focused companies fill in the gaps by providing services to oil and gas producers that need access to midstream assets. What are the steps in the midstream oil and gas value chains? The output from a well flows across three distinct midstream value chains: one each for oil, natural gas, and NGLs ( click here for an interactive infographic -- requires Flash). Oil, a mixture of natural gas and NGLs, and water flow out of a producing well and into a gas-oil separation package. That component separates the oil and water from the natural gas/NGL mixture. Midstream companies then either pump the water into a disposal well or recycle it, while the oil, natural gas, and NGLs flow down their respective value chains. The oil value chain starts with crude oil flowing into gathering tanks. It then moves by tanker, truck, or gathering pipeline to an offsite storage and blending facility. From there, a pipeline, truck, rail, or tanker will transport the crude oil to a larger storage hub, such as the United States' main hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, until it's transported to a storage tank at a refinery while awaiting processing. After they're refined, those products move again by tanker, truck, or pipeline to end users such as gas stations. Similarly, natural gas and NGLs flow together from the wellhead through gathering pipelines to a processing facility that separates methane gas from the NGL stream. From there, the natural gas and raw NGLs part ways and head down their respective value chains. Natural gas flows through transportation pipelines to natural gas storage facilities which are usually located in underground salt caverns or depleted gas wells. When needed, it will either flow into a natural gas distribution system that sends it to end users such as homes and businesses or to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility so that it can be liquefied and transported to overseas markets. NGLs, meanwhile, go from a processing facility to a fractionation complex, which then separates them into various products such as ethane, butane, propane, and natural gasoline. Those liquids then move by pipeline or truck to storage facilities before heading to end users such as petrochemical complexes, your backyard grill, or an export terminal. How midstream companies make money Midstream companies have an opportunity to make money along each link of the oil, gas, and NGL value chains, earning revenue via three primary means: fees, regulated tariffs, and commodity-based margins. Each part of the chain tends to use a preferred revenue-generating structure. Gathering pipelines, for example, tend to be fee-based. Oil and gas producers will sign a long-term contract with a midstream company, either one they control or a third party, that will then build out a gathering system to support future wells. The producer will then pay a fee on every barrel that flows through the system, similar to a driver paying a toll to go over a bridge. Storage facilities also tend to charge fees for space, much like metered parking or a public garage. Longer-haul pipelines that cross state lines, known as interstate pipelines, tend to earn regulated tariffs, which are fees determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the U.S., to ensure pipeline companies don't use their monopoly power over specified pipeline routes to overcharge for their services. In many ways, the country's interstate pipeline system is much like a toll road, since the pipelines collect more tariffs the farther the oil and gas travels down the network. Finally, a midstream company makes a commodity-based margin when it earns revenue based on the difference between the price of a raw commodity and a more refined product. That happens when a midstream company buys the natural gas and the NGL mixture from a producer and then separates it into the various NGL components like ethane and propane, which it then sells for a higher value. Processing and fractionation facilities, for example, often charge margin-based fees.

664,Are These the Best Oil and Gas MLPs in America? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 15:45:00,"Upstream MLPs are a favorite tool in the arsenal of the income investor, promising high yields and moderate distribution growth. This article highlights two of my favorite upstream MLPs and compares them to the industry as a whole, to see if they are the best upstream MLPs investors can buy. 4 Things Vanguard Natural Resources, LLCs CFO Wants You to Know About Its Debt Woes However, despite the poor showing relative to its industry peers, there are two reasons I think investors should still consider Vanguard Natural Resources: the nature of its assets and its long track record of quality management and growth. Vanguard's Wyoming gas fields increased its total reserves by 80% and daily production by 55%, but with 6,000 potential drilling locations (many of them not counted in its current reserves) Vanguard's potential production growth is vast. What's more, the costs of drilling these assets is dropping, with Ultra Petroleum, Vanguard's operator in the fields, having cut the cost of drilling a well from $7 million in 2006 to $4 million. Vanguard's production costs are 22.3% of revenues vs a 26.5% industry average, and its administrative expenses are 44% lower than its peers: 4% of revenues vs 7.2%. With strong production growth coming from its recent investments and 87% of gas production (and 90% of oil production) hedged through 2015, Vanguard's cash flows are assured, and its distribution coverage ratio is likely to skyrocket within the next few quarters. As for the quality of its management investors need only look at Vanguard's track record since its IPO in 2007 to know why I still recommend it: Reserve growth of 2,627% (60.4% CAGR) Production growth 2,667% (61% CAGR) Distribution growth of 48% (5.8% CAGR) Linn Energy: still worth owning Linn Energy's biggest problem compared to industry peers has stemmed from its troubled acquisition of Berry Petroleum, which cost $600 million more than expected. Much of the oil-rich land it acquired was fast depleting and expensive to drill, which threatened both the distribution coverage ratio and future distribution growth, thus the low analyst growth projections. However, Linn Energy's recent land swap dealwith ExxonMobil proved that management is very capable of maximizing its resources and cash flows. That deal swapped 25,000 acres of Permian land, which is sitting on over 75 billion barrels of fast depleting oil, with 500,000 acres of slow depleting, already producing gas fields in Kansas. In the process, Linn Energy lowered its costs and increased distributable cash flow by $30 million to $40 million annually, securing its distribution. And Linn Energy is far from done with profitable deals. Just this week it announced the acquisition of $2.3 billion in gas assets from Devon Energy. Linn Energy paid 6.6 times 2013 EBITDA for 3,800 producing wells with another 1,000 potential drill sites. Current production is 275 million cubic feet/day of gas at a annual decline rate of 14%, which is far lower than the Granite Wash assets Linn Energy plans to sell to pay for the deal. With Linn Energy still owning 30,000 acres of Permian land and a $40 billion annual market for oil and gas mergers and acquisitions, Linn Energy is likely to continue making highly lucrative deals in the months and years ahead. These acquisitions are likely to allow Linn Energy to grow its distribution faster than analyst projections, resulting in superior long-term total returns. Foolish takeaway While quantitatively lagging its peers, Vanguard Natural Resources, Linn Energy, and Linn Co remain solid long-term income recommendations. Short-term opportunity costs have resulted in temporary setbacks for these MLPs but their track records of quality management, accretive deal making, and consistent distribution growth gives me confidence that these investments will generate strong and growing income while outperforming the market over the next decade.

LON:UOG ) production to keep growing over the coming months, whilst repeating a buy recommendation. United on Monday reported first quarter production slightly ahead of guidance, after a 12% increase in the three months, and Cenkos expects the rate to rise again in the second quarter. First quarter production averaged 2,520 barrels oil equivalent per day, versus Uniteds guidance for 2,300 to 2,500 boepd for the first half of 2021. We would expect a further production increase in Q2/21 following a full quarters production from the ASH-3 well, Cenkos analyst James Mccormack said. In its statement, United noted production growth driven by additional output being delivered through the ASH gas pipeline and recently the addition of the ASH-3 well. ASH-3 came online in early March and has so far averaged more than 4,000 boepd gross, which gives United 880 boepd net. Elsewhere the ASD-1X exploration well, drilled successfully after ASH-3, encountered 22 metres of pay across multiple zones and testing is planned to start in the coming weeks. Cenkos noted that if testing proves successful it will lead to an application for a development lease which would allow the project to be taken into production. Highlighting further potential newsflow for the upcoming quarter the broker highlighted: We are not expecting any surprises, with United already reporting its 2020 working interest production, FY20 total revenues, and YE20 cash balances as part of its FY20 trading statement released in January. We would also expect the company to publish an updated YE20 reserves and resources report at Abu Sennan. A reserves uplift is expected given the success of the El Salmiya-5 and ASH-2 wells in 2020. Net 2P reserves at the end of 2019 were 2.97mmboe. Whilst we anticipate that the testing of the ASD-1X exploration well would take longer than the previous development wells (eg ASH-2, ASH-3 etc), we would expect that the results will be reported during Q2/21. Following the completion of operations at the ASD-1X well, the rig will move to the Al Jahraa field to commence drilling of the AJ-8 development well. United owns a 22% working interest in the project which is operated by Kuwait Energy.

Mar 15, 2013 at 4:33PM Natural gas and oil ended the week with solid gains, with one boosted by forecasts for colder temperatures and the other by signs that U.S. manufacturing is heating up. The price of natural gas rose 6 cents, or 1.6 percent, to finish at $3.87 per 1,000 cubic feet. It gained nearly 7 percent for the week, boosted mainly by forecasts for cold temperatures in many gas-consuming regions through the end of the month. Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy consultancy Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note to clients that he expects natural gas to make ""a run at the $4 mark early next week"" assuming no change in weather forecasts. The price of oil rose 42 cents to end at $93.45 per barrel. It was up $1.50, or 1.6 percent, for the week on signs of improvement in the U.S. job market and manufacturing sector. On Friday the government said a strong increase in auto output boosted U.S. factory production by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent last month. Brent crude, used to price many kinds of oil imported by U.S. refineries, gained 86 cents to finish at $109.82 per barrel on the ICE Futures exchange in London. Experts said Brent's rise was due partly to reports of lower oil exports from Iran -- which is enduring sanctions from Western powers because of its nuclear program -- and expectations about aggravated geopolitical tensions in the Middle East related to the upcoming visit to Israel by President Barack Obama. A weaker dollar was also supporting oil prices, making crude cheaper for traders using other currencies. On Friday the euro was up at $1.3057 from $1.3010 late Thursday.

The company expects oil differentials to be between $2.00 and $2.50, down from $10 in the third quarter. Now what: Investors were clearly expecting more production, but some of the decline was due to weather. Management said that drilling picked up near the end of the year to close to previous levels.

670,The Polar Vortex Is Putting a Freeze on This Industry,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 14:03:00,"Oil and gas production in the U.S. is being frozen thanks to the Polar Vortex. However, it is helping natural gas prices thaw out, which could help producers in the long run. NYSE:CLR ) warn investors that oil and gas production won't meet expectations because of the cold. The rough winter forced ConocoPhillips to lower its fourth-quarter output to 1.475 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, or Boe/d. That's down from a forecast that had America's top independent oil companies producing as much as 1.525 million Boe/d on the quarter. Meanwhile, North Dakota's top Bakken Shale producer Continental Resources had to temporarily halt well completion operations in the state. This could have an impact on its profits if the company's efforts to drill new wells remain frozen by the weather. This week's deep freeze is just the latest in weather issues faced by American oil and gas companies this year. In November, severe winter weather forced Texas-focused Pioneer Natural Resources Company ( NYSE:PXD ) to warn its investors that production was held back. Pioneer noted that the weather significantly affected its production and drilling operations. It was hit hard by ""heavy icing and low temperatures that resulted in power outages, facility freeze-ups, truck curtailments, and limited access to its production and drilling facilities"" according to a press release issued by the company. Thawing prices However, what's bad news for some producers is good news for others. Rising natural gas prices is providing a boost to top producers. For example, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation's ( NYSE:COG ) stock is up more than 10% over the past month, and up 3% this week alone. As one of the lowest cost producers of natural gas in the country, Cabot Oil & Gas makes money even if gas prices are low. Because of that, it really turns on the profits when gas prices go up. If winter's fury continues, it could fuel quite a rally for natural gas producers like Southwestern Energy Company ( NYSE:SWN ) . As the fifth largest natural gas producer in the U.S. Lower 48, Southwestern Energy has the fuel we need to keep warm this winter. Even better for its investors, as gas prices rise, so does the value of the company's natural gas reserves. Last year, the company was crushedwhen it was forced to write down nearly $3 billion in oil and gas properties because of the low price of natural gas. Rising gas prices ensure that won't happen again this year, and it might even make those properties valuable once again. Investor takeaway The Polar Vortex is freezing out most of America. It's causing some of our booming oil production to be shut down in parts of the country. However, it is helping to thaw out the price of natural gas. That could really fuel the returns of top natural gas producers like Cabot Oil & Gas and Southwestern Energy.

Jan 11, 2014 at 3:00PM This article was written by Oilprice.com -- the leading provider of energy news in the world A Canadian train carrying five cars of crude oil and four cars of liquefied petroleum gas derailed and caught on fire yesterday in New Brunswick province, prompting the evacuation of 150 nearby residents. The Canadian National Railway Co. ( TSX:CNR ) train derailment comes only days after another derailment of a train carrying Canadian crude in North Dakota, prompting a deeper intensification of the debate over the dangers of transporting crude by train since the Quebec train disaster that killed scores last year. The CNR train derailed near the town of Plaster Rock in New Brunswick, not far from the border with Main, on 8 January after ""an undesired emergency brake application,"" according to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.  After derailing, the train caught fire and was still burning on 9 January. No one was injured in the incident, but some 150 people were evacuated from their homes as a precautionary measure. CNR CEO Claude Mongeau apologized to residents of Plaster Rock and said the cause is under investigation. ""It's a bit early to assess the cause. At the moment, we're focused on containing the site and dealing with the fire,"" he said at a press conference. Mongeau said they were concentrating on a ""controlled burn"" of some crude oil and the venting of some propane tankers on the train, which was carrying a total of 122 cars and four locomotives originating in Toronto and heading to an assembly yard in Moncton, New Brunswick. The derailment comes after a similar incident just over a week ago. On 30 December, a mile-long train carrying crude oil derailed outside of the North Dakota town of Casselton, bursting into flames and erupting into a series of explosion, prompting the temporary evacuation of nearby residents. This the fifth major derailment of crude oil transport trains in six months. The most devastating was the explosion in Quebec of a runaway train carrying North Dakota crude in July last year, killing 47 people. The recent derailments could see a tightening of regulations on crude oil shipments.

According to the tender document, ONGC intends to start natural gas sale from its KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries Ltd(RIL)-BP Plc operated KG-D6fields, from June-end. Initially, 2 million standard cubic metres per day of gas has been offered for sale through an e-auction. ONGC has sought bids indexed to Brent crude oil. Bids have been sought at a minimum of 10.5 per cent of the three-month average Brent crude oil price. At the current Brent crude oil price of USD 63, the minimum price comes to USD 6.6 per million British thermal unit. This price, however, will be subject to the ceiling or cap fixed by the government for deepsea fields every six months. The cap for six months beginning April 1 is USD 3.62 per mmBtu. This essentially means that bidders may corner gas by offering to pay USD 7, but the buyers will have to pay no more than the ceiling price of USD 3.62. A senior ONGC official said the ceiling price is expected to rise to USD 5.5-5.6 at the next revision due on October 1. ""The current ceiling price is one-third less than the bare minimum cost of production from a deepsea field. After including the cost of money as well as margin, gas price should be USD 6 and not USD 3.62,"" he said. Earlier this month, Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner BP Plc of UK sought bids for the sale of 5.5 mmscmd of additional natural gas that will be available for sale from their eastern offshore KG-D6 block. The e-auction is slated for April 23 and the gas supply will start from late April or early May, according to the tender document. Bidders will have to quote a price linked to Platts JKM (Japan Korea marker) - the liquefied natural gas (LNG) benchmark price assessment for spot physical cargoes. The lowest bid that can be placed is JKM minus USD 0.3 per million British thermal unit. The highest acceptable bid would be JKM plus USD 2.01 per mmBtu. This is the same benchmark RIL-BPhad used in February to sell out 7.5 mmscmd of gas from the block. At the current price, the lowest price for the 5.5 mmscmd of gas that RIL-BP are auctioning comes to near USD 6.5 per mmBtu. But just like ONGC, RIL-BP too is entitled to a maximum of USD 3.62 per mmBtu ceiling fixed by the government for a six-month period to September 30. ONGC's KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block is expected to have a peak production rate of 15.25 mmscmd of natural gas and 80,000 barrels per day of oil.

674,Does Freeport-McMoRan's Emphasis on Oil and Gas Make It a Good Buy?,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 13:35:00,"After originally planning to sell or divest the majority of those assets, management has changed its mind. Is keeping the oil and gas assets the right choice, and does that make Freeport-McMoRan a good buy? NYSE:FCX ) shares fell sharply from the middle of 2014 to early February because of declining copper and oil prices. The falling commodity prices caused investors to become concerned about Freeport-McMoRan's over $20 billion in debt and prompted management to announce that it would consider separating the energy businesses from the company. Although several months have passed since the announcement, Freeport-McMoRan hasn't separated the oil and gas business yet. Because crude prices crashed from late last year to February of this year, Freeport-McMoRan couldn't sell those assets for reasonable prices. Now that crude prices are higher, management has taken the middle-of-the-road approach. To make sure leverage doesn't hurt as much if commodity prices go down, it's cutting costs, announced plans to lay off a quarter of its oil and gas employees, and divesting some assets. To preserve upside, it's said it's going to keep many of its oil and gas assets in addition to its core copper mines. Is management's strategy a good one? More bullish on crude than copper By recently selling previously core copper assets such as the Tenke copper mine in Congo for $2.65 billion in cash but keeping non-core oil and gas assets, it seems that management is more bullish on crude than they are on copper. Freeport-McMoRan asset sales in 2016. Tenke and Morenci are copper mines. Source: Freeport-McMoRan investor relations. This may be the right strategy. Although copper fundamentals are favorable in the long run, the sector is oversupplied and the prospect of a rebound over the next few years is uncertain. China accounts for around half of copper demand, and China's economy hasn't shown any signs of a turnaround yet. The leadership in the country has seemingly ruled out the kind of large-scale infrastructure stimulus that would send copper prices surging. Although major copper producers including Freeport-McMoRan have announced cuts this year, the announced cuts haven't been enough to send copper spot prices sustainably higher. At the moment, copper spot prices are just 10% higher than their lows for the year. Crude outlook is getting better The outlook for crude is considerably better than for copper. Among the oil bulls, there is a consensus that non-OPEC production will continue to decline and everyone in OPEC except Saudi Arabia and Iran is tapped out. Iran has several hundred thousand barrels per day of production capacity left to ramp up before needing substantial Western investment to raise production higher. Saudi Arabia has spare capacity of 2 million barrels per day, with 1 million per day available immediately and 1 million per day available in six months. Some of Saudi Arabia's immediate production is spoken for, at least during summer. The kingdom's oil consumption increases by around 400,000 barrels per day every summer because it burns crude for its energy and cooling needs. Many bulls don't think Saudi Arabia can sustain the increased 2 million barrels of production for long. They see Saudi Arabia's willingness to IPO Saudi Aramco as a sign that the kingdom's finances are worse than the official numbers state. If Saudi Arabia's finances are weaker, the country won't be able to hold prices lower for long before its own finances dip below dangerous levels. It might not be in Saudi Arabia's interest to hold crude prices low for another year, either. Saudi Arabia will benefit more if crude prices are higher when Saudi Aramco IPOs next year. Investor takeaway The bull thesis for crude could prove wrong just as it did in the middle of 2015. Demand could falter because of the weak global macroeconomy. Record inventories around the world could ensure crude prices stay low even with all the geopolitical disturbances that have popped up. No one knows for sure, but there is more and more data supporting the bullish thesis and less and less data supporting the bearish thesis every day. The latest bullish data point is the Energy Information Administration's prediction of $76-per-barrel Brent prices by 2017. If that happens, Freeport-McMoRan's management will have made the right choice. The company would realize around $2.2 billion in EBITDA from its oil and gas segment versus its current run rate of $1 billion now. In addition, Freeport-McMoRan would be able to get more for its oil and gas assets if it wanted to sell at that time.

675,The Future of Energy,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 13:26:00,"Coal is the past, but what is the future of energy? YCharts The decline in U.S. consumption is troubling for coal miners, but China's move to rely less on coal and to produce more energy domestically has hurt U.S. exports. Now that China is getting into fracking in an effort to unlock its vast natural gas reserves, I'm afraid the best days are long behind the coal industry. Oil and gas are still the heart of energy Oil consumption in the U.S. is declining, but it's still rising in developing countries, so prices haven't taken a major hit in recent years. Unlike natural gas, oil is easily transported to the market that will pay the most -- now that China is the No. 1 oil importer in the world, oil still has a long run ahead of it. Natural gas is the hottest commodity right now in the U.S. since fracking technology improved to the point where it can economically be removed from the ground. The cleaner-burning fuel is just now being adopted more widely for transportation, and the U.S. has a great opportunity to export cheap natural gas to the rest of the world. Halliburton NYSE:HAL ) and Schlumberger are two of the largest companies providing equipment and technology that make fracking possible; they'll benefit as it expands around the globe. For investors, now may be the time to buy because rig counts have been falling due to low natural gas prices, but export terminals and natural gas fuel are on their way and they'll help improve prices. Drillers should see a pickup in coming years that will benefit the patient investor. Another way to play the steady demand for oil and growing use of natural gas is through offshore drillers, particularly in ultra-deepwater. Just this week, a well drilled by Anadarko Petroleum ( NYSE:APC ) gave our first look into what may be the largest discovery ever in the Gulf of Mexico As explorers drill in more deepwater locations offshore they'll continue to add to discovered reserves, which will lead to more drilling. This reinforcing loop will help rig owners like Seadrill ( NYSE:SDRL ) and Transocean, who own large ultra-deepwater fleets and command in excess of $600,000 per day for these specialized rigs. Wind and solar are where the future is So far, we've covered the decline of coal, growth in natural gas, and the steady demand for oil. But the real growth is in renewable energy. The U.S. solar market grew 76% in the last year alone, and the cost to install solar power fell 27% to $3.01 per watt. Market researcher GTM Research expects the U.S. solar market to grow 28% annually over the next four years, giving a great opportunity to investors.

""The numbers were too intriguing, the prize was so big,"" he remembered. He thought there could be as much as a billion barrels of oil within reach in Texas, North Dakota, and elsewhere -- if only he could squeeze it out. In 2003, he had a ""eureka!"" moment while poring over pictures of rock. Sections of a 40-foot-long column of source rock had been run through a CT scanner, the same type used to peer into the human body. He saw something in the source rock sections the rest of the industry didn't know was there: a network of passageways big enough for oil molecules to pass through. Papa believed the passageways could act like rural roads for the oil to travel through. Fracking could then create superhighways for the oil to gather and feed into a pipe and up to the surface. EOG began drilling test wells, and in 2005, Papa got some results from one in North Dakota that made him realize oil could flow fast enough to pay off. ""It was kind of like holy cow,"" he says. ""My first thought was we need to replicate this, make sure it's not a freak result."" It wasn't. EOG snapped up land in a similar formation in South Texas known as the Eagle Ford Shale for $400 an acre when his competition thought it would never produce much oil. That land now goes for $30,000 per acre. Papa thought the Eagle Ford might hold 500,000 barrels of oil. The Department of Energy now predicts it holds 3.4 billion. Some even expect 10 billion, which would make it the biggest oil field in U.S. history. Smart drills, rigs that can walk But even after drillers figured out how to find oil and gas deep offshore and in onshore source rock, they still needed to develop technology that would make it economical. At the tip of every oil or gas drill is a rotating mouth of sharp teeth that chews through rock. In the past, these drill bits could only dig straight down. Now they are agile enough to find and follow narrow horizontal seams of rock. The drilling-services company Baker Hughes ( NYSE:BHI ) has designed a bit that can change directions underground, without having to be drawn back up to the surface, reducing drilling time by as much as 40 percent. Behind the drill bit, attached to a long line of steel known as the ""drill string,"" is an array of sensors. The sensors bombard rock with subatomic particles and measure the gamma radiation that bounces back. They assess how easily electricity flows through the rock and underground fluids. They analyze the magnetism of the rock and how it vibrates -- both up and down and side to side -- while drilling. ""To the layman, it looks like dumb iron, but you'd be shocked about what's inside,"" says Art Soucy, president of global products and services at Baker Hughes. All this information is sent to engineers via fiber-optic cables. They run the information through supercomputers as powerful as 30,000 laptops to create a picture of the earth thousands of feet below the surface. The people analyzing this data -- and even directing the drill bits -- are often sitting hundreds of miles away. Shell's Pennsylvania drilling operations are directed from a center in Houston, where experienced drillers monitor the progress at several sites across the country from a single room. And when the drilling is done, the rig itself can ""walk"" a hundred feet or so to another location and start drilling again. In the past, rigs had to be taken down and reassembled, which could take days. New rigs are built on sliding ""shoes"" that allow hydraulic lifts to shuffle the rig forward in short steps. ""It has made possible things that were unthinkable 10 years ago,"" says Claudi Santiago, managing director at First Reserve, a private-equity firm that invests in energy companies. Now, drillers are finding oil faster than the world is using it. At the end of 2001, the industry had enough ""proved oil reserves"" to satisfy world demand for 45 years, according to BP's annual statistical review, a closely watched study. By the end of 2011 that had grown to 51 years -- even though a decade's worth of oil had been used and daily demand had grown 14 percent. And ""proved reserves"" refers to oil that can be economically tapped using today's technology. Tomorrow's methods could yield even more. This is good news for a global economy that remains dependent on fossil fuels, but it's terrifying to climate scientists. ""If we're willing to go down this road of squeezing whatever petroleum we can out of the earth, we can easily get carbon dioxide levels up to unfathomable levels and put in motion what would be dramatic or catastrophic changes in our climate system,"" says Michael E. Mann, a geophysicist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. Renewables progress, but not fast enough Renewable technologies have had their successes. The average cost of a solar power system has fallen by 31 percent in the last two years. Solar now generates six times more electricity in the U.S. than it did a decade ago, and wind produces 14 times more. Most major automakers offer some type of electric vehicle. And this success has come despite the fact that renewable energy's major benefit -- that it doesn't pollute -- is given little or no value in the marketplace because most governments haven't adopted taxes or penalties for fossil fuel pollution. But the outlook for wind, batteries and biofuels is as dim as it's been in a decade. Global greenhouse gas agreements have fizzled. Dazzling discoveries have been made in laboratories, and some of these may yet develop into transformative products, but alternative energy technologies haven't become cheaper or more useful than fossil fuels. Solar, wind, and geothermal sources together accounted for 4.8 percent of U.S. power generation last year. Ten percent of U.S. gasoline demand was satisfied with corn ethanol, but ethanol and other fuels made from non-food sources have yet to hit the market. ""In many cases, renewables aren't ready for primetime yet,"" says George Biltz, vice president for energy and climate change at Dow Chemical ( ) , which continues to work on a host of renewable technologies. Likewise, electric cars have not enjoyed the success many expected. The battery alone in an electric car costs as much as a new gasoline-powered car, and electric vehicles are not selling nearly as fast as once projected. General Motors ( NYSE:GM ) expected to sell 60,000 Chevy Volts globally last year, but sold just half that many. Sales of Nissan's ( OTC:NSANY ) all-electric Leaf grew 22 percent around the world last year to 26,000, short of Nissan's projected 50 percent growth. The cost of wind and solar power has declined, but the price of electricity made with newly cheap fossil fuels has fallen too, making it harder for wind and solar to compete. ""Renewables are now under scrutiny. They haven't made the kinds of quantum leaps we have seen in the oil and gas industry,"" says First Reserve's Santiago, who now shuns investments in alternatives.

677,Offshore Africa: The Next Oil and Gas Hotspot?,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 13:09:00,"Recent major discoveries and promising exploratory results point to offshore Africa as an emerging hotbed of oil and gas activity. Search: Offshore Africa: The Next Oil and Gas Hotspot? Recent major discoveries and promising exploratory results point to offshore Africa as an emerging hotbed of oil and gas activity. Arjun Sreekumar May 15, 2013 at 2:09PM Ever since the late 1950s, when commercial quantities of oil were first discovered in Nigeria's Niger Delta basin, West Africa has been an area of interest for oil and gas exploration and production companies. But a host of challenges, many of them related to threats of violence and corrupt political regimes, dissuaded many of the world's leading energy companies from prospecting areas of Africa more thoroughly. However, that reluctance quickly changed to renewed optimism when Tullow Oil discovered the Jubilee oil field in Ghana back in 2007  a find hailed as one of the largest recent discoveries on the continent. Jubilee, which has an estimated reserve potential of about 5 billion barrels of oil, piqued the interest of a bevy of global exploration and production companies, who subsequently rushed into neighboring Gabon, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, eager to exploit the continent's vast natural resources. Energy companies exploring in Africa Initially, it was mostly smaller, foreign exploration and production outfits, including Ophir Energy, Kosmos Energy, Africa Oil and others, that dominated exploration off the coast of sub-Saharan Africa. Mid-sized international oil and gas companies, such as Anadarko ( NYSE:APC ) , which made an explosive move into exploring offshore Tanzania, where one of its deepwater exploration wells reported promising results last year, also played important roles. But over the past few years, the world's largest integrated oil companies have also joined the party. For instance, Brazilian oil major Petrobras ( NYSE:PBR ) is preparing to drill exploration wells offshore Tanzania, where it holds 50% stakes in two offshore exploratory blocks, while ExxonMobil ( NYSE:XOM ) has turned its attention to exploratory prospects off the coast of South Africa, where it acquired a 75% stake in blocks owned by Impact Oil & Gas late last year. And Chevron NYSE:CVX ) announcedin March that it will proceed with the development of the Moho Bilondo ""Phase 1 bis"" and Moho Nord projects offshore the Republic of Congo. The projects, situated roughly 50 miles southwest of Pointe-Noire in water depths ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 feet, are expected to cost about $10 million and produce a combined 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day at their productive peak, which Chevron reckons will be attained in 2017. Final thoughts Chevron and the other integrated oil majors' willingness to take on the high level of risk by prospecting acreage often tied to unstable political regimes highlights their urgent need to find new reserves and boost production. Many are struggling to replace the oil they produce with new reserves, as reflected by some of their weak reserve replacement ratios. For instance, Royal Dutch Shell (",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/05/15/offshore-africa-the-next-oil-and-gas-hotspot.aspx
678,3 Under the Radar Ways to Invest in the Bakken Shale Oil Boom,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 12:24:00,"Triangle Petroleum, Northern Oil and Gas, and Oasis Petroleum arent names on the radar of many investors. NYSEMKT:TPLM ) is a name few investors know. There's good reason for that, as its market cap is slightly more than $700 million. But, as its name hints, the company owns three different Bakken-based energy businesses, giving it three angles to pursue growth in the play. Triangle's first Bakken business is its wholly owned exploration and production business, Tusa. To date, Tusa has amassed a 94,000-net-acre position in the play, which is pumping out about 7,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or BOE/d. In addition, Triangle Petroleum wholly owns an energy service subsidiary called RockPile Energy Services that is focused on hydraulic pressure pumping and well completion. Along with keeping Tusa's costs down, 53% of RockPile's completion jobs since being formed have been for third parties. Finally, Triangle Petroleum owns a stake in a midstream gather and processing company called Caliber Midstream that's starting to place assets into service. Add it all up, and Triangle Petroleum is building a pretty compelling company for investors looking for a multipronged approach to investing in the Bakken Shale oil boom. The Bakken ETF Another company that is taking a uniqueand diversified approach to the Bakken Shale oil boom is Northern Oil & Gas ( NYSEMKT:NOG ) . The company owns a small, nonoperated stake in more than 1,700 producing wells in the Williston Basin. Furthermore, by staying one step ahead of the drill bit, Northern Oil & Gas has acquired a long runway of future growth as drilling continues. The other important consideration is that an investment in Northern Oil & Gas is one in the wells of a number of top Bakken Shale producers. For example, of the 1,700 wells that Northern has participated in, 3.9% are operated by Statoil. It even has participated in about 2% of the wells drilled by Triangle Petroleum. Overall, the company has more than 25 different operating partners, which has reduced its risk. Basically, taking a stake in Northern Oil & Gas is akin to investing in a Bakken ETF that's directly invested in the wells. It's a unique approach. Given the vast growth that lies ahead, Northern Oil & Gas should continue to grow for many more years.

On this episode of Industry Focus: Energy Motley Fool analysts Sean O'Reilly and Taylor Muckerman go over the most important points from the report -- how much spending and production is projected to increase by, which micro-sectors will see the most change, why the E.U. is seeing a drilling decline amid this growth, and more. Also, the hosts talk about a report from the U.S. Department of Energy, which happily reports that U.S. oil declines are finally over for the first time in several years. Listen in to find out how nervous companies are going to be about ramping up production in light of the last few years, and a few companies that investors might want to look into that could benefit from this upside. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 12, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is Thursday, January 12th, 2017, so we're talking about energy, materials, and industrials. I'm your host, Sean O'Reilly, and I'm joined in studio by the incomparable, the devilishly handsome, the spectacularly awesome Taylor Muckerman. What's up, man? Taylor Muckerman: And that's our show, ladies and gentlemen! O'Reilly: Yeah, we're going to go to a bar now. How's it going, man? Muckerman: It's good, what about you? O'Reilly: I cannot begin to tell you how much I'm loving the 60 degree weather today. Muckerman: Yeah, short sleeves right here. O'Reilly: It's going to go away tomorrow, but it's a nice break. Breaks are important. Muckerman: Fleeting to sleeting. O'Reilly: (laughs) What did you just say? Muckerman: Fleeting to sleet -- O'Reilly: No, I heard you, I just can't believe I have lived 30 years and haven't heard that before. Muckerman: I've never heard it before either. O'Reilly: You just made it up on the spot? Muckerman: Yeah. That's what this podcast is all about. O'Reilly: I'm going to walk down the street and patent that at the trademark office. Muckerman: Fleeting to sleeting? OK. O'Reilly: (laughs) Get the domain name. Muckerman:Google it, somebody might have said it before. O'Reilly: You think? You don't think you heard it in the cultural nexus? Muckerman: No, I never heard it before, it's just off-the-cuff. O'Reilly: Lies. You were watching something on Netflix last night and you just heard it. Muckerman: No Netflix. O'Reilly: It's on Always Sunny, isn't it? Muckerman:If it's on anything that I grabbed it from, that's a good guess. O'Reilly: That would be my bet. How did I know you watch that? Muckerman: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is the show. O'Reilly: Oh, yeah, I apologize, folks. Another gentleman that happens to be one of our other podcast host that loves that show is the Tech show's Dylan Lewis, if anybody wants to email him about their shared love of Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Muckerman: What is it, dlewis@fool.com ? (laughs) O'Reilly: Dylan, I'm sorry. Yeah, those Always Sunny fans ... our producer Austin is looking at us like, ""I'm going to email Dylan right now."" (laughs) Taylor, we've been talking about this theme a little bit -- because we do have to talk about serious things, in addition to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Muckerman: Yeah. You have to open it with a laugh. O'Reilly: You sent me a great article that covered a report put out by Barclays, the investment bank. U.S. oil and gas drilling to lead to 2017 global growth. Not surprising because OPEC literally told everybody, ""Hi, we want higher oil prices."" We're not at $27 a barrel anymore like it touched down at last February, we're at the low 50s. I was interested to see what they were talking about in the report. They talked about how U.S. production led by the oil majors, in terms of capital spending, likely to go up just under 60%. Muckerman: Hi Ho silver. O'Reilly: Wow. Keep in mind, also, that they were at post WWII lows of all time last year, so this is not crazy. Spending will increase 700% worldwide. This was the other cool statistic -- spending dropped by 38% last year by U.S. shale drillers. Muckerman: Yeah, that's U.S. shale. Globally, it dropped 23% last year, following a 25% drop in 2015. So, you lopped off a quarter of spending in 2015, and then you lopped off another quarter on top of that in 2016. It's a complete reversal. O'Reilly: The headline number that I started off with sounds big, but really, if you lose 50% of your money, you have to double it to get it back. Muckerman: Yeah. They're not doubling it. They're not getting back to where they were in 2013-2014. But they're trying. O'Reilly: Yeah. International drilling only increased 2%. National oil companies, like those in Russia and the Middle East, plan to spend 9% more, and this was offset by 7% decline in European companies. Muckerman: That's backwards, because Russia and the Middle East are supposed to be cutting production, but they're going to spend more. O'Reilly: This is suspicious, what's going on here? Muckerman: Makes me stroke my beard, thinking about that. O'Reilly: When it says ""European,"" is this basically Total and BP? Muckerman: When you think about Europe and the cost curve, a lot of European production comes offshore in the North Sea. O'Reilly: That's just naturally declining. Muckerman: Well, that, and it's higher up on the cost curve. And then, even shallow water in the European Union, you're looking at around $71 break even. So it's really high up there on the cost curve, it's out there past Brazilian deep water, it's out there past Canadian oil sands. The only thing I think that might be more expensive is West African offshore production. That's probably why the E.U. is seeing a decline, because A, the North Sea is difficult, and you're having to push out the risk curve -- O'Reilly: But the weather is so nice out there. Muckerman: -- because they've been drilling there for so long that the low-hanging fruit has pretty much all been pumped. And then, like I said, the price curve you see, it's just more expensive, and it's not profitable right now. O'Reilly: Can we define that for the layman? What is the cost curve, the price curve, that you're referring to? Muckerman: It's just the average break-even cost per barrel to produce in a certain region. O'Reilly: And, obviously, that varies on planet Earth. Muckerman: Yeah, it does. You look at, I think the cheapest in the United States might be the Wolfcamp in the Permian, which is around $39 a barrel, so quite profitable now. O'Reilly: Does that include buying the land, or the lease? Muckerman: I think the break even is just going to be the drilling activity to pump it out. O'Reilly: OK. So, buying the land, you would need $50-60 to make it economical. Muckerman: Yeah, I don't know the exact math, but once you own it, they're making money on the drilling alone right now. Then, you have the Eagle Ford break even at around $48 a barrel. Onshore OPEC around $40 a barrel.

680,Why Oil & Gas M&A Activity Plunged in 2013,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 12:05:00,"Last years sharp decline in the total value of global oil and gas M&A deals highlights some interesting developments amongst upstream companies. ) Jan 20, 2014 at 1:05PM Following years of strong dealmaking activity in the oil and gas industry, global oil and gas merger and acquisition, or M&A, activity plunged to a five-year low in 2013, as companies cut back on asset purchases and instead focused on developing their existing base of assets. Let's take a closer look. Why global oil and gas M&A fell last year According to a recent IHS energy M&A research report, the total transaction value of global oil and gas M&A deals fell to $136 billion in 2013, down by nearly 50% from $250 billion in 2012. The decline in dealmaking activity last year followed three years of robust global oil and gas merger activity, when companies acquired more than $600 billion of assets over the period 2010-2012. By contrast, 2013 saw many energy companies cut back on new acquisitions, opting instead to develop recently acquired acreage. Chesapeake Energy NYSE:CHK ) , for instance, devoted more than 80% of its total capex toward drilling and completion activities last year, down significantly from an average of 50% over the period 2010-2012. As a result of this change in capital allocation, as well as major improvements in efficiency, the company was able to grow oil production by 23% last year, even as its overall capex levels plunged by nearly 50% year-over-year. The trend of allocating a greater portion of capital spending toward drilling and completion activities looks likely to continue this year. For instance, Kodiak Oil & Gas ( UNKNOWN:KOG.DL ) , an oil and gas producer with assets located almost exclusively in the Williston Basin, recently announced that it plans to devote roughly 95% of its $940 million 2014 capital budget toward drilling and completion, as compared to an initially planned 77% of its capital budget in 2013. The biggest spenders in 2013 Chinese and other national oil companies (NOCs) were among the largest buyers in 2013, accounting for five of the ten largest deals struck last year. With Chinese energy demand expected to grow sharply in coming years, Chinese state-owned oil companies have been aggressively buying up oil and gas assets all over the world, and have spent more than $100 billion on acquisitions since 2009. One of last year's most important deals by an NOC was China National Petroleum Corporation's (CNPC) acquisition of a 8.33% stake in Kashagan, the massive oilfield in Kazakhstan that is being jointly developed by a consortium of partners including ExxonMobil (",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/01/20/why-oil-gas-ma-activity-plunged-in-2013.aspx

Data source: Franco-Nevada. Where Franco-Nevada has been with energy As you can see, Franco-Nevada hasn't truly emphasized oil and gas as a major part of its portfolio until recently. By far, the most important asset historically for Franco-Nevada has been the Weyburn unit, which is located about 130 kilometers southwest of the Saskatchewan capital of Regina. Franco-Nevada holds a net royalty interest of 11.71% in Weyburn, as well as a 0.44% overriding royalty and a 2.56% working interest. Cenovus Energy is the producer, and with more than 200 square kilometers, the Weyburn unit currently produces about 25,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent and has a reserve life of about 50 years. However, Franco-Nevada's other longtime energy assets are much smaller. The Midale unit in southeastern Saskatchewan produces only 4,600 barrels of oil per day, and Franco-Nevada has only a 1.14% overriding royalty and a 1.59% working interest in the unit. The Edson property lies about 200 kilometers west of Edmonton, and the natural gas play produces about 1.6 million cubic feet of natural gas and 90 barrels of natural gas liquids daily. Franco-Nevada's interest in Edson consists of a 15% overriding royalty interest. A hodgepodge of even smaller assets produces minimal revenue. These assets are scattered across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba and generally consist of high-quality oil plays and natural gas from both shallow gas formations and deeper conventional gas targets. Image source: Franco-Nevada. How Franco-Nevada is ramping up its energy activity Yet Franco-Nevada recently decided that energy would be the high-priority area for acquisitions and it has made two major purchases that promise to transform its mix between precious metals and the oil and gas industry. Late last year, Franco-Nevada bought royalty rights in the STACK shale play in Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin, paying $100 million for what amounts to an effective royalty rate of 1.61%. Ramp-up for the asset has been relatively slow, with the company claiming just $600,000 in revenue during the first quarter of 2017. However, Franco-Nevada has high hopes for the play going forward. Also in the pipeline is the Midland Basin, where Franco-Nevada agreed in March to purchase a portfolio of oil and gas royalties for $110 million. The deal hasn't yet closed, but Franco-Nevada is optimistic about the potential for further growth in energy from the purchase as horizontal drilling activity starts to increase in the area. The company expects the overall royalty rate to average just 0.14%, but over a huge swath of the basin, incorporating a gross area of about 675,000 acres. Franco-Nevada expects the deal to be complete by the end of the second quarter and add further to anticipated growth in revenue from energy for 2017. Energy is a key strategic driver for Franco-Nevada going forward, and the company is aggressively pursuing opportunities in the oil and gas industry. With so many exploration and production companies struggling under the weight of low energy prices, Franco-Nevada should be able to negotiate favorable terms in exchange for vital financing to the industry going forward.

688,You Can Make Your Returns From Oil and Gas Really Jump -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 09:30:00,"One of the toughest aspects of investing in energy involves deciding which group(s) to favor. Many of the independent producers operating solely in the U.S. onshore have done extremely well during the country's current oil and gas boom. ) Apr 9, 2014 at 10:30AM Given the ever-so-fundamental tenet that investing involves buying low and selling high, it's more than a little edifying to look at a history of companies in the energy sector. As you know well, traditional energy can be divided into several groups, including big integrateds, independent producers, services providers, refiners, midstream companies, etc. For now, let's look at surprising comparisons in share price performances among the integrated majors and the independent producers during the past five years. Regarding the latter, we'll limit our attention to those companies that operate solely in U.S. onshore oil and gas plays. As for the majors, shares of ExxonMobil Corporation ( NYSE:XOM ) , the biggest of Big Oil, have risen by 40% in the past five years. That's not especially impressive when you know the Standard & Poor's 500 is up about 118% for the same period. Chevron Corporation ( NYSE:CVX ) , the second largest U.S.-based major (and the only other fully integrated oil and gas company left in our country) has seen its shares move about 72% higher since early April of 2009. The clear message in both cases: You'd have been better off with index funds. An attractive energy Oasis Or , as an even better alternative, you might have scoured the landscape for successful independent producers, many of which handily topped the S&P's performance. For instance, there's Oasis Petroleum NYSE:OAS ) , which, with a five-year share price growth of 168%, beat the S&P by about 42%. Perhaps more importantly, the company is still widely considered a buy. Oasis Petroleum confines its operations to the Bakken and Three Forks plays. Oasis was founded in 2007 by Tommy Nusz and Taylor Reid, a pair of experienced oil and gas operators. Today, the Houston-based company's operations occur exclusively in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana. Don't be overly concerned about any sort of impending slowdown in production you may have seen forecast for the Bakken and Three Forks formations -- both of which are part of the Williston. In fact, respected Wood Mackenzie, which consults worldwide on oil and gas, among other areas, forecast just last week that a boom-and-bust scenario does not appear to be in the offing for the formations. The firm expects a 2014 average daily oil production of 1.1 million barrels there to reach 1.7 million barrels per day by 2020. Blowing past the S&P However, if you'd rather run past the index at an even faster pace, you might spend time looking at Whiting Petroleum Corp. NYSE:WLL ) . If you'd bought Whiting five years ago, you'd be smiling today over a nearly 340% share price gain, having topped the index by fully 187%. But if you think you've missed that particular high-speed train, the consensus among the analysts is that it still merits a rating slightly better than a 2.0 (buy). Like Oasis, Whiting is a major player in the Bakken. However, befitting its Denver base, it'll also expose you to its operations in Colorado's expanding DJ Basin and in the North Ward Estes Field of the revitalized Permian Basin. An even bigger explosion So, Whiting's gains still aren't good enough for you? In that case, you might closely monitor -- we always recommend that Fools do careful research before pulling the ""buy"" trigger -- SM Energy Company NYSE:SM ) . Also based in Denver, SM, which was founded more than a century ago and was previously called St. Mary Land & Exploration Company, has watched its shares explode by 365% during the past five years. Where I went to school, that was just about 210% stronger than the Standard & Poor's 500 during the same timeframe. Like its above-discussed brethren, the company also operates in the Bakken and Three Forks. And as with Whiting, it's busy in the Permian Basin. But there's more: It's also in the prolific Eagle Ford play of South Texas. And for even more diversity, it manages assets in the Haynesville shale of Louisiana and Texas, along with the oilier (and fast-emerging) Woodford shale, which covers much of Oklahoma. Foolish takeaway There are, of course, other independent domestic producers that have done very nicely by their shareholders since the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing created an oil and gas boom in the U.S. But since it would be silly to assume that the best is past for this contingent, I suggest you get to know this group awfully well.

689,Statoil Reminds Us Just How Risky the Oil and Gas Exploration Business Is -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 09:30:00,"Despite its industry-leading track record of exploration success, even Statoil sometimes encounters dry wells. Jul 3, 2014 at 10:30AM Energy, Materials, and Utilities Despite radical advances in technology and improvements in safety, the oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) industry remains a highly risky one. Even though E&P companies now have a fantastic array of tools at their disposal, including more advanced drilling rigs and seismic acquisition techniques, exploration success is far from guaranteed. Just ask Statoil NYSE:EQNR ) . Despite being of the most capable oil and gas exploration companies in the world, the Norwegian oil giant's most recently drilled Arctic well turned out to be a failure. Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons Statoil's dry well Statoil's Apollo well, located in one of the northernmost reaches of the Barents Sea, failed to yield commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and turned out to be a ""dry"" well, according to a statement by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. While a disappointment for Statoil, the well's poor results were cheered by Greenpeace activists who had been working diligently to delay Statoil from drilling it. Greenpeace and other environmental groups believe that drilling in an area so close to the Bear Island nature reserve and the edge of the polar ice cap is extremely risky since an oil spill could seriously endanger vital ecosystems. Still, environmental opposition and disappointing results from Apollo won't do much to slow down Statoil's ambitious exploration program in the Barents Sea and the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). In fact, the Spitsbergen rig that drilled Apollo is now venturing even farther north to drill the Atlantis well. The rig is owned by Transocean ( NYSE:RIG ) , a company that provides offshore contract drilling services for upstream companies, and is on contract to Statoil. Seeking to raise cash to upgrade its fleet of rigs, whose average age is much older than competitor Seadrill's ( NYSE:SDRL ) fleet, Transocean recently announced that it plans to raise as much as $350 million through the initial public offering of a company that owns three of its drillships. Statoil's active exploration program This year, Statoil plans to test the potential of the Hoop area in the Barents Sea and continue exploratory drilling near the Johan Castberg discoveries. While the Johan Castberg exploration program has failed to meet Statoil's expectations, the company still believes in the field and is evaluating several nearby prospects for drilling in 2014. Statoil also plans to drill 20-25 exploration wells in the NCS this year, of which around two-thirds will be Statoil-operated. The company's track record in the region is one of the best in the industry. Over the past five years, its exploration success rate in the NCS has averaged more than 70%, significantly higher than the industry average of 49%. Overall, Statoil says it will maintain a high level of exploration activity, with plans to spend $3.5 billion on exploration activity to complete roughly 50 wells in six high-impact basins this year. One of the company's biggest opportunities lies in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is currently drilling in a potentially game-changing prospect called Martin. What's next for Statoil? Despite the recent miss at Apollo, Statoil was the world's leading oil and gas explorer last year as measured by the total volume of conventional oil and gas discovered, and lay claim to the year's largest oil discovery: the Bay du Nord find offshore Canada. Over the period 2011-2013, it made 11 high-impact discoveries with a cumulative resource potential of 3.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In addition to its active exploration program, Statoil also has a number of offshore projects in the NCS and Gulf of Mexico, as well as onshore programs mainly in U.S. tight oil plays, which should help drive 3% annual production growth through 2016. The company is also focused on improving its capital efficiency and boosting shareholder returns through a $5 billion reduction in spending over the next three years and the proposed implementation of a quarterly dividend. The combination of these measures should help Statoil improve its financial performance and generate stronger returns for its shareholders in the years ahead, assuming commodity prices remain high and assuming that key projects can be brought online on time and on budget.

690,"Oil and Gas Stock Roundup: Oil and M&A Fuel This Weeks Gains (HOS, ERF, EPM, REN, HK)",fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 09:00:00,"Hornbeck Offshore Services, Enerplus, Evolution Petroleum, Resolute Energy, and Halcon Resources rallied sharply this week. data by YCharts So what Mergers and acquisitions activity fueled this week's gains in both Resolute Energy and Enerplus. In Resolute Energy's case, it spent $135 million to acquire 3,293 net acres in the Delaware Basin, bolstering a key growth area. Meanwhile, Enerplus is reportedly going the other way, with Reuters saying the company is seeking a buyer for its Marcellus shale natural-gas assets; Enerplus expects that the sale could fetch up to $500 million, which it would use to repay debt. Although rising oil prices helped, Evolution Petroleum rose this week after announcing the redemption of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, which it plans to fund with cash on hand. Evolution Petroleum noted that it has plenty of liquidity due to its undrawn credit facility, which carries a much lower interest rate than the preferred stock. The rally in crude oil was the primary driver of the double-digit gains in Halcon Resources and Hornbeck Energy Services this week. Halcon Resources recently emerged from bankruptcy, which was the result of too much debt and the deep drop in oil prices. While it was able to eliminate $1.8 billion of debt and slash interest expenses by $200 million annually, Halcon still has $1.09 billion of debt to support; it needs elevated oil prices to generate cash flow for growth and ongoing debt maintenance. Hornbeck Offshore Services' finances were also challenged by weak oil prices, with the company seeing the borrowing base on its credit facility cut by a third this past July. While it has ample liquidity, Hornbeck Offshore needs higher oil prices so that its customers are incentivized to ramp up offshore drilling activities, which would flow down to more work for the company. Now what Little by little, the oil market is showing signs of improvement. The increase in oil prices is encouraging companies with access to capital to make acquisitions, while others are jettisoning noncore assets so they have cash to reinvest into core properties. That said, the market still has a way to go before the weakest players are back on solid ground.

691,The Best Oil and Gas MLP in America Just Hit a Grand Slam -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 08:46:00,"Breitburn Energy Partners, expected to be the fastest growing oil and gas MLP in America over the next decade, just hit a grand slam with its latest $3 billion purchase of QR Energy. Jul 29, 2014 at 9:46AM Energy, Materials, and Utilities As part of a series exploring the upstream (oil and gas producers) MLP industry, I named Breitburn Energy Partners the best upstream MLP in America This is because Breitburn Energy Partners is the fastest growing upstream MLP and its management team -- masters of disciplined and accretive acquisitions -- is high quality. From 2011 to 2013 Breitburn made $2.1 billion in acquisitions, and the pace is accelerating with $1.2 billion worth of purchases coming in the form of two major deals in 2013. Breitburn Energy Partners has a 15-person team devoted to scouring America for high-quality, already producing, low-decline assets that can grow its distributable cash flows and its distributions. In 2013, it examined 400 potential buyout candidates before selecting its Permian basin bolt-ons and the Postle oilfield in Oklahoma. The Postle field is an enhanced oil recovery project, where CO2 is pumped into the wells, maintaining pressure and production. Breitburn Energy Partners expect little to no production decline for several years, and this purchase emphasizes the partnership's shift toward higher-margin liquids. The Permian assets consist of 300 drilling locations on the Wolfberry shale, estimated to hold 18.3 million barrels of oil equivalent. Currently, only 93 locations are in production at an average cost of $7/barrel. This means Breitburn's Permian acreage is not just highly profitable, but it also has a large growth runway ahead of it. Breitburn Energy Partners was guiding for $600 million in 2014 acquisitions, and today it announced a grand-slam deal that puts that guidance to shame. $3 billion deal makes Breitburn the largest oil-focused MLP in America On July 24, Breitburn Energy Partners announced it was acquiring QR Energy for $1.67 billion in cash and stock. Including QR Energy's class C convertible units, the deal is worth $3 billion, which is 400% above Breitburn Energy Parners' acquistion guidance for the year. QR Energy unit holders will receive 0.9856 Breitburn units for each unit of QR Energy they hold. This represents a 19% premium to QR Energy's recent closing price and will come as welcome relief to QR Energy investors, who have seen their units trade at 40% discounts to the value of their oil and gas assets However, the news gets better for everyone involved, because QR Energy just reported preliminary Q2 blowout results, proving Breitburn Energy Partners made the correct decision in acquiring it. QR Energy just reported: Production of 20,264 barrels/day, up 17.6% from Q2 2013. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of $69.6 million, up 14% year over year. Distributable cash flow (DCF) up 24.6%. Distribution coverage ratio improved from 0.9 to 1.1. The biggest reason QR Energy unit holders should be happy with this acquisition is because QR Energy would have had a very difficult time growing its distribution without this buyout. QR Energy recently announced it was planning on raising its capital expenditure budget by 82% to focus on expanding existing oil producing assets, rather than seeking further accretive acquisitions, as it had done with $1.4 billion in purchases since its IPO. This was likely because QR Energy's unit price was trading at such a discount that making accretive acquisitions by issuing equity would have been very challenging. Meanwhile, QR Energy was facing a 20% dilution cliff, a result of buying out its general partner, a deal that put a stop to horrendous dilution of up to 10% per quarter. While the deal was immediately 7% accretive to DCF, the upcoming dilution would have threatened the security of QR Energy's distribution and made future distribution growth all but impossible -- thus, QR Energy's decision to invest in increased production, the only growth avenue available to it. However, with this deal, QR Energy investors trade an MLP with little to no growth prospects for units in the fastest growing, and now second largest oil and gas MLP in America. Source: Breitburn Energy-QR Energy acquisition investor presentation, July 24, 2014, page 6. Thanks to QR Energy's 20,264 barrels/day of production, Breitburn Energy Partners will now be a $7.8 billion MLP with 57,300 barrels oil equivalent production per day and reserves of 323 million barrels of oil equivalent. This means this acquisition will increase Breitburn Energy Partners' production by 55% and its reserves by 51%. The deal also raises Breitburn Energy Partners' liquids mix from 60% to 67%. Distribution growth for everybody The best news from this deal is that it represents distribution growth for investors in both Breitburn Energy Partners and QR Energy. Breitburn has announced that it intends to increase its distribution $0.07/year upon the close of the acquisition, expected in Q4 2014 or Q1 2015. This represents a 3.5% distribution increase for Breitburn, and 5% growth for QR Energy unit holders. This raise comes on top of the 4.7% distribution raise Breitburn just announced after reporting its own record-breaking quarterly results. Foolish takeaway Breitburn Energy Partners just hit a grand slam with an accretive acquisition that ensures many years of secure and growing distributions for both it and current QR Energy investors. With a safe and growing 9.3% forward yield paid monthly, Breitburn Energy Partners represents the best upstream MLP in America and should be on every long-term income investor's radar.

692,These Are the 2 Best Oil and Gas MLPs in America -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 08:15:00,"Upstream MLPs are the darling of high-yield seeking income investors. This article highlights five important metrics investors in these securities needs to know and uses them to screen for the two best oil and gas MLPs in the country. Our Worst Predictions in 2015 Breitburn Energy Partners has always been one of my favorite oil and gas producers but not until I did this industrywide comparison did its potential become apparent. With a generous yield, low volatility, a coverage ratio that is tied for second best in the industry and analysts projecting staggering growth over the next decade, Breitburn Energy Partners exemplifies one of the best energy investments in America. The key to Breitburn's success is its approach to expansion and production maintenance. First, Breitburn Energy Partners is a master of accretive acquisitions -- $2.1 billion worth from 2011-2013. Its 15-person acquisition team is careful to ensure that any purchased assets are low decline and immediately accretive to existing unit holders. For example, in 2013, Breitburn analyzed 400 potential acquisition targets before making two purchases for $1.2 billion. The result of its purchases has been 113% growth of proven reserves, including 72% growth in high-margin liquids (oil and natural gas liquids). With $773 million in liquidity and management targeting $600 million in acquisitions this year, Breitburn's growth is set to continue, but what makes Breitburn one of the top MLPs in its industry are the assets it's targeting and its use of enhanced oil recovery techniques. Breitburn's $860 million Oklahoma oil field purchase included 29,357 net acres of oil rich land and plenty of infrastructure, including an oil pipeline, gas processing plant, and CO2 pipeline that allows for enhanced oil recovery (CO2 injection into wells to maintain pressure). This results in little to no production decline and will greatly help Breitburn Energy Partners grow its distribution in the future. Breitburn is also aggressively hunting for new oil-rich resources in the Permian Basin -- an area estimated to hold 75 billion barrels of oil that costs just $7/barrel to extract. Coupled with aggressive hedging through 2018, Breitburn Energy Partners' cash flows and distribution growth are expected to accelerate for years to come. New Source Energy Partners is the smallest and newest upstream MLP, having IPOed in 2013, and it drills out of the Hunton formation of central Oklahoma, where it owns 20.6 million barrels of reserves -- 71% high-margin liquids. New Source Energy Partners has grown its reserves (45%) and production (44%) in just one year through a series of six oil and gas acquisitions, but what makes it a unique MLP opportunity is its oil services business. In November of 2013, New Source Energy began purchasing oil service companies. To date, its four acquisitions total $160.8 million and its oil services operations include the Permian, Eagle Ford, and Marcellus/Utica shales, with plans to expand into the Bakken. The fast-growing oil services business is expected to bring in $170 million in revenue in 2015 at an EBITDA margin of 25%-29%, and grow revenues by 369% from 2013 to 2015. Finally, investors should be aware that although it's a new upstream MLP, New Source Energy has one of the best management teams in the industry: 29 year track record drilling in Hunton, 98% success rate 37.9% net margin vs 9.6% industry average 12.9% return on assets vs 3.5% industry average 24.2% return on equity vs 7.6% industry average Foolish takeaway Upstream MLPs are one of the best ways for long-term income investors to cash in on America's record-smashing energy boom. Breitburn Energy Partners and New Source Energy Partners represent the best of the industry when it comes to all the major factors that affect long-term total returns. With low volatility and secure, generous yields that are expected to grow quickly, Breitburn Energy and New Source Energy have the potential to be two of the best-performing investments of the next decade.

693,This Trio Fueled Julys 15.6% Plunge in Cabot Oil & Gas Corporations Stock -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 08:03:00,"Oil, analysts, earnings, oh my! No wonder Cabot Oil & Gas Corporations Stock dropped in July. Aug 7, 2015 at 9:03AM Energy, Materials, and Utilities What: Shares of Cabot Oil & Gas ( NYSE:COG ) slumped 15.6% in July. Fueling the slump was a combination of weaker oil prices, an analyst downgrade, and the company's own disappointing second-quarter report. So what: We'll start with oil, which dropped 20% in July, starting a new bear market for the black liquid. After rebounding for much of the year, the oil market took a turn for the worse last month due to renewed fears over supply growth, namely from Iran, and weaker demand growth from China. Given that weaker oil hurts Cabot's revenue via lower oil realizations as well as its impact on NGL prices, it's no surprise to see the stock plunge along with oil. Further, with oil growing weaker, analysts are updating their opinions on the sector with Barclays deciding that Cabot's stock was now ""significantly overvalued"" given its new view on oil. As a result, it stripped the company from its list of top oil and gas stocks. That being said, Goldman Sachs was actually a bit more bullish on Cabot's future by highlighting it on a list of seven companies that might draw buyout attention from an oil major due to its prime position in the Marcellus shale. Having said that, Cabot's prime position didn't do it any favors during the second quarter as its earnings missed expectations by a penny. Further, the company isn't very bullish on its own near-term future as it has decided not to accelerate drilling activity later this year or early next year. It's in a wait-and-see mode at the moment and wants to see better prices before it increases spending. Now what: While Cabot isn't bullish enough to invest more money to boost production, it still sees better days ahead. The company expects that a new pipeline will help it more easily move its gas to markets enabling it to fetch a better prices. That said, higher prices in general certainly wouldn't hurt.

694,3 Oil and Gas Stocks for Ambitious Investors -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 07:44:00,"These stocks aren't popular in the energy industry today, but they have a chance of doing great things for one's portfolio. caught people off guard when he called Core Laboratories ""way overvalued"" and went short. Since Einhorn's call, Core's stock price has dropped 11%, and Einhorn says it could fall another 38% before being fairly valued. Needless to say, it's a pretty ambitious move to bet against someone who has made billions in the market. But at the same time, Einhorn isn't infallible and has made short bets in the past that failed miserably (including shorting Chipotle Mexican Grill years ago). And I, for one, think that's likely to be the case for his short bet against Core Lab. While his argument that Core is heavily exposed to offshore drilling is true and that it isn't a ""secular growth"" stock, it remains one of the more important companies in the oil and gas industry when it comes to resource recovery. The bottom line is that Core Lab's innovation and technical expertise have proven to help producers recover more oil and gas more quickly and cheaply, and that's critically important at any oil price. Furthermore, Core's business may not be as reliant on higher prices as Einhorn thinks, even offshore. Offshore oil is cost-competitive at lower prices -- but high initial development costs have brought offshore drilling to a standstill in recent years. Even with low oil prices, offshore drilling is likely to start recovering in 2018, and that will be a boost for Core. Looking at the bigger picture, Einhorn could be ""right"" over the next couple of quarters as oversupply continues to rock the oil market. But I'm betting its share price is much higher a couple of years from now. Play the long game Tyler Crowe (Transocean): Like Jason said, offshore development has quite possibly been the hardest-hit segment of the broader oil and gas industry. Producers, the ones that make the ultimate capital allocation decisions in this business, have elected to either not spend any money at all or to spend that money on faster, easier-to-develop sources like shale. As a result, those oil service and equipment companies that specialize or are heavily weighted to the offshore drilling game have suffered mightily. Heading into this downturn, Transocean was looking like it could be one of the first casualties of a shake-up in the offshore rig space. Much of its fleet was comprised of older, ineffective rigs that were past their economic lives, and it had a rather sizable debt load that would be hard to handle as revenue dried up. Thanks to the management of CEO Jeremy Thigpen, though, the company completely transformed itself in the midst of this tough time. The company decided to scrap dozens of older rigs as they rolled off-contract and elected to focus on its fleet of high-specification rigs that can either handle ultra-deepwater depths -- more than 10,000 feet -- or harsh drilling environments like the North Sea. At the same time, it has been chipping away at its debt load and building up a cash pile such that it has about $5 billion in debt. Today, the company is in a much better position both from a fleet and financial position and is likely ready to handle any more rough seas the oil market will throw it over the next year or two. It is likely going to take a while longer until we see a recovery as shale has kept oil prices low for a while, but this can't last forever and Transocean will be well positioned when demand for offshore rigs comes back. Massive upside if oil prices come roaring back Matt DiLallo (Whiting Petroleum): The oil market downturn shook leading Bakken shaleoil producer Whiting Petroleum to its core. That's because the collapse in oil prices occurred right after the company unveiled a bold move to buy rival Bakken driller Kodiak Oil and Gas for $6 billion in a deal that made it the region's largest oil producer. That transaction, though, came back to bite the company big time because it added a significant amount of debt to its already stretched balance sheet. That troubling financial situation is a key reason why the stock is down more than 90% over the past few years. The company, however, spent much of the market downturn shoring up its balance sheet and driving down costs so it could better manage lower oil prices. It has made tremendous progress, having already slashed debt 42% over the past year. Because of that, Whiting was in the position where it could increase spending on new wells this year, which would reverse its production decline. In fact, the company's current budget is double last year's level and should lead to a 23% increase in production by year-end. There's just one problem with that plan: It requires an average oil price of $55 per barrel to balance cash flow with capex. At the moment, crude is currently $10 a barrel below that level, which means Whiting is on pace to add debt back to its balance sheet. That's not something it can afford to do since the company has $1.5 billion in debt coming due over the next three years. This situation has investors worried that Whiting will continue struggling, which is why the stock has plunged 50% this year. That said, Whiting Petroleum's stock could bounce back quickly if oil rebounds. That makes it a compelling option for ambitious investors who are bullish on oil prices because they could make a boatload of money if oil cooperates.

695,Oil News: A Flood of Asset Writedowns Looms on the Horizon,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 07:30:00,"Analysts expect a flood of oil asset writedowns from global energy giants such as Royal Dutch Shell all the way down to smaller wildcatters like Sanchez Energy. NYSE:CWEI ) . These drillers didn't have the financial discipline of their larger peers as smaller drillers outspent cashflow considerably over the past few years, so they could be forced to make larger writedowns. Matador Resources recently hinted this could be the case when it delayed its analyst day by two weeks at which time it will be prepared to report its fourth-quarter results as well as its update to proved reserves. By hosting its Analyst day after releasing this data it will have more time to go through the numbers with analysts and investors. These numbers will undoubtedly be affected by asset writedowns, as lower oil prices will almost assuredly result in a lower value for the company's oil and gas reserves. Sanchez Energy's risk lies in its exploration program. The company is exploring the Tuscaloosa Marine shale, which has proven a tough play to crack as it requires very high oil prices for drilling to be profitable . Because of that, some of the value of the company's acreage dedicated to exploring this play could be written down. Clayton Williams, meanwhile, has acreage and reserves in Texas that might need to be written down due to the collapse of oil prices. Broadly, it's likely that aggressive drilling plans in recent years will now force small and midsize shale drillers to make writedowns due to the current market situation . Investor takeaway Investors need to brace themselves as energy companies of all sizes write down the monetary worth of oil assets that continue to lose value now that petroleum prices have been cut in half. That being said, this doesn't mean these assets have disappeared -- a return to higher oil prices or improved technology could eventually allow these values to be put back on the books.

696,3 Stocks to Avoid in the Oil & Gas Sector,fool,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 07:10:00,"There's often opportunity in a beaten-down sector. Our contributors don't think these three stocks fit that bill. YCharts And while it's true that often the best time to invest in a cyclical industry is when it's in a downturn, the trick is to invest in high-quality businesses that are positioned for the recovery but also able to ride out a downturn that's yet to truly show signs of coming to an end. We reached out to three of our top contributors and asked them to discuss an oil and gas stock that's best to avoid, and they gave us an offshore drilling contractor with a shrinking book of business and looming debt maturities, a specialty products manufacturer with a struggling business that needs a lot of things to go perfect to turn around, and a ""big oil"" player that exclusively focuses on exploration and production -- a tough place to be when prices are low. Here's what they had to say. Staying afloat getting harder : Like essentially all of its offshore oil and gas drilling competitors, Seadrill Ltd. ( NYSE:SDRL ) is living on business that it locked up well before oil and gas prices began falling in 2014. Unfortunately, the company's backlog -- also like those of its peers -- continues to shrink with each passing quarter. Seadrill finished the first quarter of the year with a $4.3 billion contracted backlog, but that number had declined $700 million by the end of the third quarter, to $3.6 billion. At the current rate, Seadrill's backlog is on track to decline another $1.4 billion by year-end, leaving the company with only $2.3 billion in contracted revenue for 2017. Considering that the company must repay or refinance $450 million in debt before the end of 2016 and another $2 billion by June 2017, things could go from bad to worse very quickly if offshore oil producers don't start showing some appetite for new spending in the very near future. Seadrill has $1.3 billion in cash on hand, and that will help the company ride out the downturn a little further. But until the cycle bottoms and the investment freeze in offshore projects thaws, Seadrill's place should be on your watch list, not your buy list. Lots of housecleaning to do Tyler Crowe : There are a lot of stocks that don't look that appealing right now in the energy industry for a multitude of reasons, ranging from being overly reliant on high commodity prices, having too much debt, or just not having a well-managed business. One company that has embodied all of these things in recent years is Calumet Specialty Products Partners ( ) , and it's a stock that should be avoided at all costs. The thing that's so discouraging about Calumet is that below the underperforming financials and several management missteps in recent years, there is a niche market that it can profitably service while generating decent returns for investors. Problem is, though, that the company splurged way too much on acquisitions or investing in projects that had questionable futures, all the while piling on debt such that the the company today is taking out loans with 11% coupon rates. The interest payments on that capital are simply too high to ever expect a decent return on equity. To make all this worse, this company is structured as a master limited partnership, so it should be paying some sort of a distribution. Unfortunately, the company has dug itself into such a large hole that it had to suspend its payout. CEO Timothy Go was brought into the company at the beginning of 2016 and has laid out a plan that could put the company back on the right track. For it to work, though, a lot of things will have to go right for the company. For investors, there is just too much risk that the stars won't align just right for Calumet to pull off this turnaround. So investors are just best avoiding this company altogether. This big oil company looks like a bad investment today",https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/09/15/3-stocks-to-avoid-in-the-oil-gas-sector.aspx
697,Will Net-Zero Oil And Gas Save Fossil Fuels From Extinction?,ibtimes,"Apr 12, 2021",2021-04-12 05:35:25,"Oil and gas producers are betting big on reducing the emissions profile of oil and gas production. Will Net-Zero Oil And Gas Save Fossil Fuels From Extinction? By Matthew DiLallo 04/12/21 AT 1:35 AM The  oil industryis facing an uncertain future. The global economy is in the midst of a  multidecade transition to cleaner fuel sourcesto reduce its carbon emissions profile. Many countries and companies have set ambitious goals of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. While that suggests fossil fuels have no future, energy companies are exploring ways to produce oil and gas without the associated emissions. They hope that producing net-zero or carbon-neutral oil and gas will allow fossil fuels to have a role in fueling the economy in the future. What is net-zero oil and gas? Oil and natural gas are hydrocarbons. As such, they emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases when burned as fuel sources. Scientists believe that those associated greenhouse gases are contributing to climate change. With growing concerns about how much climate change could impact the economy in the future, it's leading governments and companies to accelerate their transition to lower-carbon fuel sources. The oil and gas industry believes that it can go from being one of the contributors to this problem to providing an economical solution. Driving that view is the industry's belief it can reduce and offset the emissions profile of its operations and the usage of its end products to net out at zero. Oil companies are taking several sets to cut the emissions produced via their oil and gas operations. For example, they're reducing the amount of natural gas they flare, utilizing  solar energyto power oil fields and infrastructure, and installing technology to capture methane emissions. These initiatives could enable many oil companies to achieve net-zero emissions from their oil and gas production businesses in the coming years. In addition to that, several companies are investing in carbon capture and storage projects. These facilities would extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in underground formations. Oil companies believe that they could eventually capture enough carbon dioxide to completely offset the emissions produced in their products' associated usage. What energy companies are focusing on net-zero oil? A growing number of energy companies are taking steps toward producing net-zero oil. One of the leaders is Occidental Petroleum  ( NYSE:OXY ) . The company launched Oxy Low Carbon Ventures to utilize its long-standing, industry-leading expertise to lower carbon emissions. The company has a long history in carbon storage as it's a leader in using carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery. This process utilizes carbon dioxide (produced naturally or captured from an industrial source) to increase a legacy field's oil production by injecting it underground, increasing field pressure, and boosting the production rate. Occidental aims to leverage this expertise to capture more carbon from industrial and atmospheric sources and inject it underground for storage in legacy oil and gas fields or other naturally occurring subsurface locations. For example, Occidental Petroleum recently  agreedto assist  LNGdeveloper NextDecade ( NASDAQ:NEXT ) in reducing the carbon emissions profile of its Rio Grande development in Texas. Occidental will receive carbon dioxide from that site and permanently store it in an underground formation in the Rio Grande Valley, where there's ample capacity for storing carbon dioxide. This agreement would support NextDecade's proposed carbon capture and storage project associated with Rio Grande LNG, capturing and storing more than 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, making it one of the world's greenest LNG projects. Oxy Low Carbon Ventures is also developing the world's largest direct air capture system that should extract 1 million metric tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year. The company will use this carbon dioxide in its enhanced oil recovery business, enabling it to produce lower carbon oil. Oil giant ExxonMobil  ( NYSE:XOM ) is also taking steps to clean up its carbon emissions profile. The company launched  ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutionsearlier this year. The initial focus of that business unit will be to support the development of up to 20 new carbon capture and storage projects worldwide. Exxon is already a leader in carbon capture and storage as it currently captures 9 million tonnes per year, the equivalent of planting 150 million trees. Exxon plans to invest $3 billion through 2025 on low carbon solutions. U.S. oil producer EOG Resources  ( NYSE:EOG ) is also taking steps to clean up its emissions profile. The company set the goal of eliminating natural gas flaring from its operations by 2025. Further, it established the ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2040. EOG Resources is allocating more of its capital budget toward environmental projects to reduce its emissions. For example, it's working on a closed-loop gas capture system, which will reinject gas into existing wells to reduce its methane emissions. It's also utilizing solar to power more of its field operations. The goal of these investments is to produce oil and gas with net-zero emissions. Occidental Petroleum took the first step this year, delivering the world's first shipment of carbon-neutral oil. It captured and stored enough carbon dioxide from an industrial source to completely offset the greenhouse gas emissions produced in the production and combustion of this 2 million barrel shipment. That's the first step toward its ambitious target of delivering 100% net-zero oil by 2050. Only time will tell if this is the right strategy Energy companies are taking different approaches to the energy transition. Some are pivoting their businesses toward renewable energy. However, others like Occidental Petroleum, ExxonMobil, and EOG Resources aim to make fossil fuels cleaner. It's not clear if that strategy will pay long-term dividends given the preference toward emissions-free energy sources like wind and solar and emerging options like green hydrogen. That means investors shouldn't make big wagers on the survival of the oil sector until it's clear that net-zero oil and gas will play a prominent role in fueling the global economy in the future.

Jason Hall, Tyler Crowe, and Matthew DiLallo Sep 16, 2018 at 6:03AM Even when we're not writing about stocks, we're probably discussing some investment theme or stock that perks our interest. Here's a sneak peek at some of the conversations that go on behind the scenes with some of our writers here at The Motley Fool. While crude prices tend to drive oil stock prices from day to day, being able to identify the long-term term trends can unlock the best investment opportunities in the space. Tyler, Matt, and I (Jason here) discussed this exact topic recently, and three trends emerged from our conversation that we see playing out in a big way in 2019. Image source: Getty Images. If you're looking to invest in oil and gas, having some understanding of how these trends could play out -- and how they could impact your portfolio -- could go a long way toward helping boost your returns and helping you avoid potential losses, too. The next wave of LNG facilities in the U.S. are on their way Tyler Crowe : Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, has been one of the hottest markets for fossil fuels in recent years, and by most estimates, it will remain that way well into the next decade. The rapid declines in costs associated with building an LNG export facility and the recent discoveries of prolific gas reserves have made LNG a much more attractive energy option for high demand places like the Asia-Pacific region, especially those regions where pipeline access is limited. In 2017, LNG demand grew by a spectacular 7.2%, which is unheard of in the fossil fuel industry. The U.S. has emerged as one of the places that will benefit immensely from the boom in LNG. Shale gas is so cheap in the U.S. that it is a preferred supplier even though transportation costs to Asia are higher than other big players like Australia. There are currently two facilities in the U.S. shipping commercial cargoes of LNG -- Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass and Dominion Energy's Cove Point -- with another five under construction with planned start-ups next year. Image source: Getty Images. What really has my attention, though, is the next wave of proposed LNG facilities that will likely get a Final Investment Decision (FID) in 2019. According to most analysts, there will be a severe supply shortage in LNG by 2025 from a lack of new facilities getting the green light. That could change, however, if several companies decide to give the green light for a couple of massive projects. Two that will be slated for FID next year are Tellurian's (",https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/16/oil-and-gas-2019-3-investing-themes-you-dont-want.aspx

Oil & Gas With key deals, Uganda''s nascent oil sector nears maturity Museveni, who has led Uganda since 1986, has sometimes suggested that the discovery of commercially viable quantities of oil in 2006 created an opportunity for him to remain in power PTI April 12, 2021, 07:23 IST Kampala: Uganda, Tanzania and French oil company Total are set to sign agreements Sunday on building a heated pipeline to carry crude oil from western Uganda to the Indian Ocean coast. Construction of the pipeline, which would be the world's longest at 897-miles, is expected to begin this year. Tanzania's new leader, President Samia Suluhu Hassan, is in Uganda to sign the documents, perhaps her most important executive action since her inauguration last month UgandanPresident Yoweri Museveni and officials from Total, a majority shareholder in Uganda's oil fields, will also sign the agreements, which were long held up by tax disputes, administrative delays, and the death of Hassan's predecessor. Despite anxiety over falling crude prices in recent years, hopes have remained high in Uganda over the potential for oil exports to lift the East African country into upper middle-income status by 2040. Annual per capita income in Uganda was less than $800 in 2019. A 2015 World Bankstudy emphasized that the economic benefits would be considerable if local companies are competitive enough to win lucrative service contracts in the oil sector. Museveni, who has led Uganda since 1986, has sometimes suggested that the discovery of commercially viable quantities of oil in 2006 created an opportunity for him to remain in power. ""They are targeting my oil,"" he said of his challengers in the country's 2016 presidential election. Watchdog groups and others have warned against the personalization of Uganda's oil resources and heavy borrowing by national budget authorities anticipating oil revenue. It remains unclear when Uganda will export its first drop of crude, since developing storage sites, processing facilities and other key infrastructure will take time. Total's investment partner in Uganda is the China National Offshore Oil Corporation or CNOOC which has a smaller stake in the pipeline project. The shareholder agreements cover the construction of the USD 3.5 billion pipeline designed to connect oil fields near Lake Albert to the Tanzanian port of Tanga. Plans for the pipeline have been attacked as ""irresponsible"" by activists who say it is not compatible with the goals of the Paris climate accord. Critics also say the rights of local residents are at risk and that the pipeline, which would cross rivers and farmland, will damage fragile ecosystems. The project could cost more than 12,000 families their land rights, the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights recently charged. Facing calls to abandon its projects in Uganda, Total last month said it would limit oil extraction from a national park to less than 1% of the protected area. The company also said it would fund a 50% increase in the number of game rangers in Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda's largest protected area. Total acknowledged ""significant social and environmental stakes"" posed by oil wells and the pipeline, and pledged to proceed responsibly. But criticism of the pipeline project is likely to persist. ""Despite our persistent calls for urgent action from the Ugandan government, Total, and CNOOC, the oil project is accelerating while most of our concerns and recommendations remain unaddressed,"" Antoine Madelin, advocacy director of the International Federation for Human Rights, told The Associated Press ""The move to go ahead with the final investment decision is worrying, in light of the major environmental and human rights risks that remain,"" Madelin said.

UNKNOWN:KMP.DL ) essentially collect fees for each barrel of oil or natural gas passing through their pipeline regardless of its price, their payouts are relatively safe, steady, and secure. But a relatively new breed of MLP has been developed that skews that model, and despite appearing similar on the surface, their payouts represent a greater degree of risk. They're heavily reliant on the price of the underlying asset to make their distributions, because it determines how much they produce. Linn Energy as an oil and natural gas driller is one such MLP, as is coal miner Oxford Partners, frack sand producer Hi-Crush Partners, and nitrogen fertilizer maker Rentech Nitrogen. Pencil pushers LinnCo is yet a different animal altogether. It has no assets; it has no operations. Its sole purpose is to own units of Linn Energy so that it can receive distributions from the MLP and convert them into regular dividends. MLPs are structured to payout most of there profits to shareholders, and while those payments are nominally dividends, called distributions in this case, and they get special tax treatment and have a whole separate -- and complex -- paperwork regime that needs to be calculated by investors at tax time. LinnCo was created to simplify that process by doing the dirty workfor the investor and pay out regular dividends instead, a far simpler transaction for those owning shares. But to invest in LinnCo is to require a close examination of Linn Energy. Ready for a washout The driller has directed more than half of its capex spending to the Granite Wash, where it's moving all of its gas rigs to oil and has hedged 100% of its oil production through 2016. While the hedging will likely benefit drillers near term as oil prices remain below their highs, Goldman Sachs predicts we're entering a secular period of stable pricing in the $90-a-barrel range that may pressure profits for drillers over the long haul. Like natural gas, drillers are extracting oil from previously hard-to-reach assets at ever greater rates, and while it's hard to imagine pricing getting pummeled the way gas has, even the investment bank has narrowed its expectations of oil's peak. It now anticipates Brent oil at most averaging $110 in 2013, down from its previous call of $130 a barrel. Linn Energy looks stable for the time being, meaning LinnCo does too, but investors need to go in with their eyes wide open.

705,CONSOL Energy Bulks up on Gas,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 14:10:00,"CONSOL Energy purchases a vast swath of natural gas drilling rights from Dominion Resources. NYSE:CNX ) continues its transition from coal to natural gas. Just last week the company closed a massive $3.5 billion deal that offloaded five legacy coal mines in West Virginia. Now CONSOL is acquiring natural gas drilling rights on 90,000 acres in that state. The $190 million deal with Dominion Resources ( NYSE:D ) sees CONSOL picking up the drilling rights to the natural gas below Dominion's natural gas storage fields. CONSOL is joined on this deal with its 50% joint venture partner Noble Energy ( ) which is exercising its rights to own 50% of this drilling allowance. Dominion Resources sold off its legacy oil and gas exploration business years ago to focus on its utility segments. However, the company still owns a large natural gas storage business, as well as a sizable natural gas pipeline network. The drilling rights being sold to the CONSOL/Noble venture involve acreage it owns as part of its natural gas storage system. Dominion's natural gas storage business is actually made up of depleted conventional natural gas well. In addition to buying these drilling rights, CONSOL agreed to be an anchor shipper on Dominion's natural gas transmission system. That makes it a solid deal for Dominion, which cashes in on an asset that it wasn't using to generate income while also adding natural gas volumes to its transmission business. CONSOL sees this as a great deal for its investors as well. CEO Brett Harvey said these ""parcels represent what could be the largest untapped contiguous acreage in the southern core of the Marcellus Shale."" He noted that the acres are a good complement to what CONSOL and Noble already own in the region. Furthermore, it is believed that more than half of the acreage will contain more valuable wet natural gas. Overall, CONSOL and Noble believe that more than 350 future Marcellus Shale wells can be drilled on these acres. Further upside could come from drilling wells in the Upper Devonian formation, which is also part of the deal. With this deal, along with the exit of some of its legacy coal assets, CONSOL Energy is positioning itself as a major player in the Marcellus Shale. The coal mine sale gave the company the financial flexibility to accelerate gas drilling over the next few years. CONSOL's gas production had been rather flat the past few years, but it's planning to grow production by as much as 32% next year and 30% in both 2015 and 2016. Coal has been one of the biggest casualties of America's energy boom. That's a big reason why CONSOL has shifted its focus to natural gas, and that shift has the company well positioned to grow in future years. That makes it an interesting company to own in the years ahead. Motley Fool Returns",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/10/consol-energy-bulks-up-on-gas.aspx
706,Increased Oil and Gas Activity Boosted Emerge Energy Services' Revenue This Quarter,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 13:23:00,"A modest uptick in well activity put Emerge Energy Services' revenue back on the right track. ($4.5 million) Data source: Emerge Energy Services earnings releases. The reason for the loss on an EBITDA basis while registering a positive net income result was from the sale of its fuels business to Sunoco LP ( NYSE:SUN ) that was completed in August for $167 million. That attributed to a $32 million gain on the income statement. From an investor point of view, don't take this as much of a difference maker. If we strip out that one-time gain, earnings per share would have been a loss of $1.24. The one thing that is worth pointing out as a positive is that the volume of sand sold increased dramatically from the prior quarter. Total sand shipments this quarter totaled 493,000 tons, a 24% gain from the second quarter. Even revenue in this part of the business increased 26%. The reason that those revenue gains don't show up in the overall results is because the fuels segment that it sold to Sunoco is a relatively high-sales, lower-margin business, and the decline in revenue from having that on the books until Aug. 31 skewed revenue results. Overall, this is a good trend, though. With the fuels segment gone, management can focus on getting its sand business up and running. Costs were a little higher this quarter than they should have been, but part of that had to do with its Arland, Wisconsin facility starting up and ramping up at its Kosse, Texas, facility. As product sales rise and these facilities start working to capacity, it should help spread out the high fixed costs associated with running these facilities. What management had to say For several quarters, Emerge's balance sheet was skating on very thin ice. Operational profits dried up and put the company in violation of its debt covenants. So CEO Ted Beneski wanted to highlight some of the financial moves the company has made -- and plans to make -- that will shore up the company's financials. We believe that we are in the early stages of a recovery for the oil and gas markets. We are proud of the progress we have made on our strategic plan laid out at the onset of this downturn. During the third quarter, we closed the sale of the Fuel business to Sunoco, raised $20 million of equity, and paid down our bank loan to approximately $153 million at quarter end.  We also completed an important amendment with our lenders that resets our covenant package.  As the final step to strengthening our balance sheet, we are actively working on a public unit offering and expect to compete the capital raise soon. That equity raise thing is the one thing that will likely impact investors over the long term depending on the size of the raise. A large dilution of shares would certainly mute some of the expected gains we should expect from rising sand demand. What a Fool believes The rise in sand volumes is exactly what Emerge needed this quarter. Now that it has sold its fuels business, frack sand will have to carry the load for the entire company. Emerge isn't the only one that has so far reported a decent-sized upswing in sand sales, so it appears that the oil and gas industry in North America is making its slow march back up. This will be especially good for Emerge, as the amount of sand used per well has more than doubled in a few years. The oil and gas industry doesn't even need to get back to where it was drilling activity-wise for Emerge and others to see sand sales go way beyond what they were a couple years ago. As this happens, Emerge should start to see its cash flow get restored and the company can start to pay investors a distribution again. After the company completes the equity raise Beneski hinted at, though, those distributions could end up being much lower than they were before.

The drive to curb carbon dioxide emissions appears to be gaining momentum among major players in the U.S. oil and gas industry, but opinions differ on how best to achieve that goal. One of last weeks most popular articles among Rigzones downstream readers is a case in point. Read on for details on this and other recent articles that caught their attention. OXY CEO Rejects USA Carbon Tax Several prominent voices in the U.S. oil and gas industry have recently embraced the idea of putting a tax or other price on carbon dioxide emissions. Vicki Hollub, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY), has declared that she is not one of them. Calling a carbon tax bad for a lot of the industry and for consumers, particularly the economically disadvantaged, Hollub pointed out that her company does not advocate such an approach, Bloomberg reported. Instead, OXY supports existing tax credits that encourage firms to store CO 2 Where Can My Oil and Gas Skills Take Me in the Energy Transition?

708,No One Is Better at Finding Oil and Gas Than Chevron,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 13:00:00,"Last year Chevron was the best in the business at finding new sources of oil and gas. NYSE:APC ) . That discovery really demonstrates how good Chevron is at what it does. The company and its partners drilled a total of 31,866 feet, in water nearly a mile deep, to make this discovery. That's about 6 miles down, or 106 football fields laid end-to-end. While that discovery is about half the size of the one that Conoco and Anadarko announced just a week before Chevron's, it is still massive. It's also just one of Chevron's success stories in discovering major oil and gas deposits in the Gulf over the past few years. Best of all, some of those projects are just starting to bear fruit. For example, its Big Foot field is expected to produce 75,000 barrels of oil and about 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day at a total project cost of more than $4 billion. That one field equates to about 10% of the current oil production of the lauded Bakken shale. It's just one of the many projects Chevron is working to bring online even as it continues to discover new sources of oil. Chevron does one thing really, really well, and that's discovering new sources of oil and gas to feed the world's voracious energy appetite. That success is giving the company increasing confidence that it can increase its daily production by 25% by 2017. What that means is that the money it spends on exploration really should start to pay off for investors over the next few years.

709,Has the Potential of Shale Oil and Gas Been Overstated?,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 13:00:00,"Addressing shale wells' high rates of decline and potential investment opportunities. Jan 19, 2013 at 2:00PM Author Bio Arjun is a value-oriented investor focusing primarily on the oil and gas sector, with an emphasis on E&Ps and integrated majors. He also occasionally writes about the US housing market and Chinas economy. Over the past year, political disagreement has been one of the biggest impediments to restoring the American economy and bringing it closer to operating at its full potential. Though the so-called ""fiscal cliff"" was avoided, a meaningful resolution on America's fiscal situation is yet to be reached. Most Americans believe, rightly so, that Congress just can't seem to agree on anything. But in a world repeatedly brought to a standstill by partisan rhetoric, one of the few things that people do seem to agree on is the rapid growth of American energy production. Most experts -- whether analysts, geologists, or economists -- would probably agree that rising oil and gas output will likely create a substantial numbers of jobs and provide a major boost to U.S. GDP in coming years. But there are others -- admittedly a small minority -- who argue that the potential of oil and gas to reignite the U.S. economy has been vastly overstated. They suggest that America's reserves of shale oil and gas have been grossly misrepresented by official statistics and that we have nowhere close to a 100-year supply of shale gas. Do these skeptics raise a genuine concern, or are they motivated by other factors to misconstrue the facts? The skeptics' view The crux of the skeptics' argument is that the true amount of shale oil and gas has been grossly overstated because of out-of-date models that fail to properly account for shale wells' decline rates, which, they argue, are extremely high. Hence, they characterize shale production as extremely uneconomical at current prices. David Hughes of the Post Carbon Institute is one of the skeptics and has a very pessimistic view about the production potential of shale wells. For a study that should be released by the Post Carbon Institute next month, Hughes has meticulously analyzed detailed information about individual shale wells, especially those in the Bakken formation of North Dakota and Montana. His analysis has led him to a sobering conclusion: Bakken wells decline extremely quickly. He finds that, once production from the average Bakken well begins to decline, its production flow falls to a fifth of its peak level within just two years. Separate calculations by the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources reached a similar conclusion. This finding has one major implication. For annual production from the Bakken to keep rising, energy producers will need to bring on more and more new wells each year. According to Hughes' calculations, more than 800 new wells per year will be needed to offset field decline. Moreover, he found a great degree of variation across Bakken wells. While some wells have been remarkably productive, such as, for instance, Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas' ( UNKNOWN:KOG.DL ) wells in McKenzie County, N.D., the average well has not. Hence, a handful of super-rich wells may be skewing the average production data upward. Implications of the skeptical view David Hughes is not alone. Joining him are Arthur Berman, a Houston-based geologist and consultant; Bob Brackett, a senior research analyst at Bernstein Research; Chris Nelder, an energy analyst and consultant; and many more who believe that the shale gas revolution has been overhyped. The widely divergent estimates of future shale production among experts highlight some important facts. Specifically, they show how the lack of a comprehensive data set presents a major setback in reaching agreement on the productive potential of shale wells. Because shale production is a relatively recent development, there are no shale wells that have concluded a full life cycle as of yet. Hence, their estimated ultimate recoveries, or EURs, are all based on models, which, of course, are based on assumptions. EUR is a very important concept in oil and gas geology. It represents the total amount of hydrocarbon that can reasonably be expected to be economically recovered from an oil and gas well, field, basin, or reservoir by the end of its producing life. Energy companies use the measure for various purposes by energy companies, the most important of which is to determine whether a well, field, basin, or reservoir is economically viable and profitable to drill. Hence, EURs shape many major decisions by energy companies. Yet they are just estimates. In many cases, they can vary drastically depending on the assumptions used in the model. Some of the shale gas industry's largest operators are projecting EURs in the range of 5 billion to 10 bilion cubic feet or higher per well. In sharp contrast, Berman reckons average EURs are closer to 1 billion to 2 billion cubic feet per well. Here, the numbers make all the difference. Since profitability is determined by the actual ultimate recovery and the price of natural gas at the time, an EUR of 2 bcf would fetch roughly $4 million at a price of $2 per mmBtu, while an EUR of 10 bcf would obviously fetch five times that amount. Hence, the difference the actual ultimate recovery makes to a natural gas producer's bottom line is hugely important. How to invest in natural gas companies If you're still uncertain about the future outlook for natural gas prices, as I am, you may want to consider some safer strategies to gain exposure to the commodity. In my view, investing in high-quality oil and gas companies that have a balanced production mix between crude oil and natural gas is probably one of the safest bets. One company that I recommended investors take a closer look at in a previous articleis Devon Energy ( NYSE:DVN ) . In recent years, the Oklahoma City-based company has achieved a much more balanced production mix and plans to continue growing liquids production at a rapid clip for the foreseeable future. Devon is also very well managed and boasts a strong balance sheet. Another safer way to gain exposure to natural gas is by investing in well-hedged companies. Among North American energy companies, hedging through commodity derivatives is one of the most effective and commonly used risk-management tools to mitigate commodity price risk. One of the most conservatively hedged upstream companies out there is Linn Energy ( OTC:LINEQ ) . The company has hedged 100% of its expected oil production into 2016 and 100% of natural gas production into 2017. Linn employs a unique strategy which entails acquiring oil and gas properties with low-risk production profiles and relatively low operating costs. This strategy, in combination with its highly conservative hedging strategy, has served it well so far and should continue to do so. And finally, if you're convinced by the skeptics' argument that gas prices will rise faster than expected and want to take a riskier route, you may want to check out some high-quality pure-play natural gas companies.

710,The $250 Billion Problem That's Holding Back American Energy Independence,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 13:00:00,"Oil and gas production in America is being held back as the industry struggles to overcome one major obstacle to its growth. Search: The $250 Billion Problem That's Holding Back American Energy Independence Oil and gas production in America is being held back as the industry struggles to overcome one major obstacle to its growth. Aug 16, 2013 at 2:00PM Photo credit: Flickr/ shannonpatrick17 Oil and gas producers struggle with a number of issues, but there is one in particular that is really holding them back: lack of infrastructure. By some estimates, this is a $250 billion problem for the industry. That is the amount of midstream infrastructure investment that's required to get the record volumes of oil and gas moving from production basins to market centers. In fact, this past year a number of producers have pointed out that lack of necessary infrastructure is costing them valuable production. In some cases this production is simply being shut in; however, as fellow Fool Tyler Crow recently pointed out, lack of infrastructure is actually costing Bakken producers more than a billion dollars each year One producer that recently acknowledged its infrastructure issues is Magnum Hunter Resources ( OTC:MHRCQ ) In fact, in the last quarter, the company had 1,873 barrels of oil equivalent worth of production per day shut in due to infrastructure issues. That would have boosted its production for the quarter by another 12%, which is no meager sum for the small oil and gas producer. Part of the problem is of the company's own creation; it simply discovered more natural gas liquids than it had previously estimated that it would find. While that's a good problem to have, it still was a drag on the quarter -- the company's midstream subsidiary needed to invest in additional equipment as well as wait for new permits to be issued before its added production could start flowing. In addition to the lack of pipeline capacity, Magnum Hunter had to wait for the processing capacity at the MarkWest ( UNKNOWN:MWE.DL ) Mobley plant to be expanded to handle the additional volume. Currently, the plant has enough planned capacity, so this won't become problematic for Magnum Hunter for at least the next year. One of the bigger issues, though, is getting these volumes of natural gas liquids to customers; its estimated that more than 1.4 million barrels of liquids per day will be produced in the Marcellus and Utica by 2020, but there is just 400,000 barrels per day of takeaway capacity currently under construction. MarkWest is one of a number of midstream companies working on a long-term solution. The company recently announced a joint venture with Kinder Morgan Partners ( UNKNOWN:KMP.DL ) on an natural gas liquids pipeline to the nation's Gulf Coast petrochemical center. The project, which will also include a processing complex in Ohio and fractionation facilities on the Gulf Coast, won't be operational until the fourth quarter of 2015. It's the third proposed project that is designed to link the Marcellus and Utica to the Gulf Coast. The first project announced was Enterprise Product Partner's ( NYSE:EPD ) ATEX Express. The key to getting it off the ground was the fact that about 70% of the route uses existing pipeline which has been repurposed for the project. Not only does this limit the environmental impact of the project, which is important in light of the issues that the Keystone XL has encountered, but it also enables Enterprise to get the work done faster and cheaper. Similarly, MarkWest and Kinder Morgan's pipeline will convert 900 miles of existing pipe while building another 200 miles to get the project into service. While the issues in Appalachia have led to lost revenue and have crimped profits, it's not the only region that has been plagued by infrastructure problems. Producers in the Bakken have really had a rough time getting natural gas production into pipes. In fact, Magnum Hunter noted that it was forced to flare 12 million-15 million cubic feet of natural gas per day last quarter. Its midstream partner, ONEOK Partners ( NYSE:OKS ) , has encountered significant problems in the process of connecting all of its wells. It's so bad that Glenn Dawson, the president of Magnum Hunter's Williston Basin unit, has called the process ""very slow and painful"". The plan is to have the gathering system complete by the third quarter of this year. Clearly, lack of infrastructure is holding back the production of oil and gas. Midstream companies aren't the ones to blame -- they are investing billions to move these projects forward. In fact, ONEOK has already announced more than $5 billion in growth projects through 2015 and has another couple of billion dollars in projects that it has yet to announce. Meanwhile, MarkWest is planning to invest up to $1.8 billion this year alone, while Kinder Morgan has more than $13 billion in growth opportunities over the next five years. While some blame can be levied on a slow permitting process, the real obstacle is that production is moving faster than the infrastructure to handle it can be built. This could spell opportunity for investors because midstream operators will need access to capital to move these future projects forward.

In fact, all posted quarterly profits for the first time in over a year. Will the party be short-lived? Image source: Getty Images. So what Maybe not. The price war started by OPEC in 2014 has had the opposite effect that was intended. Rather than drive American shale producers out of the market, it has made them more resilient as various new technologies (multilateral drilling, simultaneous operations, micro-seismic, water flooding, and the like) have driven down production costs in the past 36 months. In the book The Absent Superpower, geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan makes the case that a combination of new technologies could push production costs to $25 per barrel by 2019 in the four major shale plays -- on par with low-cost Saudi oil fields. That would mean American shale production is here to stay. And rather than simply swiping the former largest importer of crude oil off the market, the new economies of shale could allow producers to gradually ramp up exports to more directly impact OPEC revenue streams. That would also explain the pessimism around these companies, which aren't major players in the lowest-cost fields. Halcon Resources, Carrizo Oil & Gas, and SM Energy each own marginal acreage in the low-cost Permian, with substantially more holdings in higher-cost plays. For instance, Halcon Resources ended the first quarter with 82% of its production coming from the Williston Basin (including Bakken and Three Forks) and just 2.4% of production coming from newer assets in the Delaware Basin (part of the Permian). Likewise, Carrizo and SM Energy generated just 3.8% and 28.7% of their respective production from the Permian Basin, although the latter is gas-heavy.

Fueling their free-fall was a 4% drop in the price of crude, which plunged after government data showed that oil inventories unexpectedly grew last week. So what: According to the Energy Information Administration crude oil inventories grew by 2.6 million barrels this week. That shocked the market, which expected inventories to fall by 800,000 barrels. What this suggests is that there's still way too much oil in the market right now, which is signaling to the market that oil prices could really stay lower for longer. The hardest hit by today's plunge is Eclipse Resources, which was down more than 20% on the day. It's a rather surprising plunge as nearly two-thirds of Eclipse Resources production is actually natural gas while only about 15% of its production is oil. Vanguard Natural Resources is also in the same boat as it's primarily a natural gas producer. Further, as an MLP most of Vanguard Natural Resources' oil production is hedged leaving it even less exposed to today's drop. Panhandle Oil and Gas, likewise, is a natural gas-focused company as 69% of its production is gas. Also worth noting is the fact that Panhandle Oil and Gas has a pretty solid balance sheet, so its built to weather the storm. Clearly, this is a case where investors are selling first and asking questions later. Baytex Energy, on the other hand, is primarily an oil company with 82% of its total production is crude oil so its no surprise to see its stock down more than 14% today. Especially considering the fact that Baytex Energy is a Canadian oil producer, which hurts it even more as Canadian oil typically sells at a discount to U.S. oil because of pipeline constraints. As such, it is a bit more exposed to the oil downturn than the other three big movers today.

Many countries and companies have set ambitious goals of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. While that suggests fossil fuels have no future, energy companies are exploring ways to produce oil and gas without the associated emissions. They hope that producing net-zero or carbon-neutral oil and gas will allow fossil fuels to have a role in fueling the economy in the future. Image source: Getty Images. What is net-zero oil and gas? Oil and natural gas are hydrocarbons. As such, they emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases when burned as fuel sources. Scientists believe that those associated greenhouse gases are contributing to climate change. With growing concerns about how much climate change could impact the economy in the future, it's leading governments and companies to accelerate their transition to lower-carbon fuel sources. The oil and gas industry believes that it can go from being one of the contributors to this problem to providing an economical solution. Driving that view is the industry's belief it can reduce and offset the emissions profile of its operations and the usage of its end products to net out at zero. Oil companies are taking several sets to cut the emissions produced via their oil and gas operations. For example, they're reducing the amount of natural gas they flare, utilizing solar energy to power oil fields and infrastructure, and installing technology to capture methane emissions. These initiatives could enable many oil companies to achieve net-zero emissions from their oil and gas production businesses in the coming years. In addition to that, several companies are investing in carbon capture and storage projects. These facilities would extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in underground formations. Oil companies believe that they could eventually capture enough carbon dioxide to completely offset the emissions produced in their products' associated usage. Image source: Getty Images. What energy companies are focusing on net-zero oil? A growing number of energy companies are taking steps toward producing net-zero oil. One of the leaders is Occidental Petroleum NYSE:OXY ) . The company launched Oxy Low Carbon Ventures to utilize its long-standing, industry-leading expertise to lower carbon emissions. The company has a long history in carbon storage as it's a leader in using carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery. This process utilizes carbon dioxide (produced naturally or captured from an industrial source) to increase a legacy field's oil production by injecting it underground, increasing field pressure, and boosting the production rate. Occidental aims to leverage this expertise to capture more carbon from industrial and atmospheric sources and inject it underground for storage in legacy oil and gas fields or other naturally occurring subsurface locations.

But the market wasn't too impressed: The stock ended the day nearly 1% lower. Despite what the market's reaction suggests, the company continues to fire on most of the metrics that matter. Production, earnings, and cash flow all grew by double digits, while costs continued to trend down. But wide price differentials in the Marcellus shale remain a major near-term concern and could continue to weigh on the stock. A Marcellus shale drilling site. Photo credit: Chesapeake Energy Corporation Second-quarter highlights Cabot reported second-quarter net income of $118.4 million, or $0.28 per share, as compared to $89.1 million, or $0.21 per share, in the prior year quarter. That topped analysts' estimates by $0.03 a share. Total production jumped 34% year over year to 127.6 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), while liquids production surged to 961,000 barrels, up 64% year-over-year pro forma for last year's asset sales. Marcellus output increased 41% year-over-year to average 1,258 million cubic feet (Mmcf) per day during the quarter, while Eagle Ford production soared 76% to 10,308 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day. Cash flow from operations rose 19% to $329.6 million, up from $277.3 million in the second quarter of 2013, while discretionary cash flow rose 12% year over year to $332.3 million. Wide differentials remain a challenge But the biggest letdown of the quarter was natural gas price realizations, which have been a problem for the company in recent quarters and are one of the biggest factors weighing on its share price. Cabot received just $3.47 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) for its gas production in the second quarter, down 15% year over year, and $3.78 per Mcf excluding the impact of hedges. That amounts to an $0.89 discount to NYMEX settlement prices, which is significantly wider than the $0.60 to $0.65 per Mcf average discount the company reported in the first quarter. While that's obviously not good, it's pretty remarkable that Cabot was able to generate more than $50 million in free cash flow despite the sharply lower realized prices. This was due in part to the company's exceptionally low total unit costs, which improved 16% over last year's comparable quarter to just $2.59 per thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe). That makes Cabot one of the lowest-cost Marcellus shale producers, if not the lowest-cost producer -- obviously a huge competitive advantage. Help is on the way In the near-term, differentials could remain wide, which would continue to weigh on Cabot's share price. But as I have argued before, differentials should compress significantlyover the next three to four years as major new infrastructure projects like the Constitution pipeline and the Atlantic Sunrise project come online. The Constitution pipeline, which will be 75% owned by Williams Partners (NYSE: WPZ) and 25% owned by Cabot, should go into service in late 2015 or early 2016. It will boost Cabot's takeaway capacity by some 500 Mmcf per day, which is nearly 40% of its current production. Similarly, the Atlantic Sunrise project will provide an additional 850 Mmcf per day of takeaway capacity after it comes online in 2017. Combined with Cabot's existing takeaway capacity on Kinder Morgan's Tennessee Gas Pipeline 300 Line and the Millennium Gas Pipeline, these options will greatly diversify its gas marketing options by providing access to premium markets and more favorable gas indices. As a result, basis differentials should compress significantly after 2016. Investor takeaway Cabot's second-quarter performance highlights the company's continued operational excellence. Despite sharply lower realized gas prices, it still managed to generate free cash flow thanks in part to solid cost management. While wide Marcellus basis differentials may remain a headwind over coming quarters, upcoming infrastructure projects should help reduce them over time. Given Cabot's underperformance this year and its exceptional growth prospects, I think it's currently a very compelling long-term buy.

715,3 Energy Companies Innovating With Natural Gas,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 11:00:00,"How Halliburton, Apache, and Cabot Oil & Gas are putting natural gas to good use. Jun 15, 2013 at 12:00PM Author Bio Arjun is a value-oriented investor focusing primarily on the oil and gas sector, with an emphasis on E&Ps and integrated majors. He also occasionally writes about the US housing market and Chinas economy. With the glut of natural gas in the U.S., domestic companies are exploring different avenues of putting the cleaner-burning fuel to good use. Some, like Cheniere Energy ( NYSEMKT:LNG ) , whose Sabine Pass terminal was the first LNG export venture to receive federal approval, are looking to export the stuff. Others are using it right here in the U.S. to power trucks and other vehicles. Waste Management ( NYSE:WM ) , for instance, has amassed a sizable fleet consisting of 2,000 trucks powered by compressed natural gas, or CNG. It even recently opened a new CNG fueling station in Bristol, Pa., to help fuel its growing fleet, as well as to provide fueling options for the public. Along with LNG exporters and companies with large trucking fleets, other companies are also finding innovative ways of tapping the plentiful supply of U.S. natural gas. Let's take a closer look at three of them. Halliburton First up is oilfield services company Halliburton ( NYSE:HAL ) , which recently revealed how it's using natural gas to fuel some of its vehicles. In a YouTube video, the company announced the addition of nearly 100 new light-duty trucks that can run on compressed natural gas. The trucks, which can burn either CNG or gasoline, will be used for regular business operations, such as transporting personnel and equipment, in various locations where the company operates, including California, Colorado, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Utah. According to a statement by the company, the deployment of these trucks is part of a pilot program the company is implementing to help it decide how to expand its natural gas usage. The company's rationale behind using CNG has to do with cost savings and greenhouse gas emission reductions. Indeed, Halliburton reckons the new trucks will slash emissions by 90% when they burn CNG and save roughly $5,100 in annual fuel costs. The company is also cozying up to the idea of using natural gas to fuel hydraulic fracking operations, an approach that exploration and production companies including Apache (",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/06/15/3-energy-companies-innovating-with-natural-gas.aspx

717,Why Big Colorado Oil & Gas Producers Anadarko and Noble Energy Dropped 11% in May,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 09:35:00,"A home explosion had consequences for these two oil industry players. Is it a buying opportunity? NASDAQ:NBL ) . These top oil and gas producers in Colorado saw their stocks' performance suffer as three factors affected their outlook: an Anadarko gas well blamed for a home explosion in Colorado, fallout from their Q1 earnings, and tumbling oil prices. Anadarko's stock dropped 10.8% throughout the month, and Noble's fell 11.2%. That was in a month when the overall oil and gas production and exploration market -- as measured by the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Production and Exploration ETF -- fell only 6.7% and the S&P 500 overall rose by 1%. An uncapped underground gas pipe attached to an Anadarko well was responsible for a home explosion in Colorado. Image source: Getty Images. So what On April 27, a home in Firestone, Colorado -- a suburb north of Denver -- exploded, killing two men who were replacing a hot water heater. What at first appeared to be a tragic household accident was soon linked to an Anadarko-owned gas well that was less than 1,000 feet from the property. Sure enough, investigators eventually discovered that an abandoned return flowline connected to the well hadn't been properly capped. Gas from a cut in the pipeline seeped into the home, causing the blast. As a result, Anadarko and Noble -- Colorado's two largest gas producers -- were ordered to inspect all of their wells located within 1,000 feet of buildings. Both were also the targets of a lawsuit filed from a different Firestone homeowner in mid-May. It's tough to tell exactly what effect the fallout from the explosion may have had on the companies' stocks, because both companies reported earnings in early May (Noble on the 2nd and Anadarko on the 3rd), right around the time that the well was emerging as the cause of the explosion. Then what The companies' earnings weren't what analysts -- or investors -- were hoping to see. Anadarko reported Q1 earnings of negative $0.60/share, much worse than the analysts' consensus of negative $0.26/share. Noble fared somewhat better, with earnings of negative $0.05/share, compared to analysts' consensus of negative $0.13/share. Although both companies reported negative earnings, there were some bright spots. Noble reported record Q1 sales volumes from its operations in Israel, where it spent 75% of its capital expenditures. It also made a bolt-on acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy, adding to its position in the red-hot Southern Delaware Basin in Texas. Anadarko reported some record sales volumes of its own, in its deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations and its Delaware Basin holdings. It also improved its margins by achieving a liquids product mix of 61%, up from Q1 2016's 53%. But even with these improvements, the company still wasn't able to turn a profit. Between those negative earnings reports and the Colorado news, both stocks' shares tumbled in the early days of the month, and then slid further along with the overall oil industry in the later part of the month, as oil prices dropped, ending a three-week rally:",https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/06/why-big-colorado-oil-gas-producers-anadarko-and-no.aspx
718,How This Oil and Gas-Focused Company Plans to Aggressively Grow Earnings,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 09:32:00,"This industrial company looks set to increase revenue and margins in the coming year. Here's what you need to know before buying its stock. YCharts. Will Dover Corp make the numbers? That said, the question is whether management will achieve its targets in the coming years. The following chart breaks out segment operating profit from 2016 and then uses projections based on management's guidance for segment operating profit in 2019. Data source: Dover Corp presentations, analysis and chart by author. In thousands of U.S. dollars. Simply put, Dover needs oil and gas capital spending to stay in growth mode, and that obviously depends on energy prices. As you can see in the chart above, the big jump in earnings is expected to come from the energy segment. In addition, around 29% of fluids segment revenue is expected to come from pumps in 2017 -- a large part of which comes from the petrochemicals industry. Moreover, Dover's energy segment exposure by end market in 2017 is heavily weighted (67% of the total) toward drilling and production (which is largely dependent on a growing rig count), with the product mix split between 65% coming from core products and only 35% coming from recurring and replacement products. In other words, buying Dover based on its future earnings projections means buying a stock on the expectation that oil prices will at least stabilize. Dover's oil-and-gas-based earnings are highly cyclical. What rivals are saying While Dover's management feels confident in its projection, it's worth considering what its competitors like General Electric Company ( NYSE:GE ) are saying. (For reference, Dover competes with GE/Baker Hughes and others for around 78% of its forecast 2017 energy revenue.) In one of his last presentations as CEO, Jeff Immelt sounded a note of caution concerning GE's oil and gas outlook. ""We see orders improving, but it's off a low base. So I still think we have to underwrite caution in that space."" His comments served as a reminder that GE's oil-and-gas-based revenue continually failed to meet expectations in 2016. The bottom line All told, Dover's investor presentation contained a lot of promise for investors, but based on GE's commentary and Dover's heavy exposure to the cyclicality of oil and gas capital spending, it's far from a given that Dover will meet its numbers by 2019. In short, the stock is attractive if you like the outlook for oil prices and want some exposure to energy, but worth avoiding if you aren't confident in the future of energy prices.

NYSE:XOM ) , on the other hand, production and pricing have been ongoing obstacles to growth. Given their size, it's incredibly difficult for these oil supermajors to find enough new energy-producing assets to make up for the natural rate of decline in any given well's production levels. Yet although Exxon is projecting just 2% to 3% annual growth in production over the next four years, Chevron hopes for better results with its plan to raise its production by a million barrels per day representing growth of between 9% and 10% annually. Meanwhile, the energy boom has once more heightened environmental concerns over oil and gas production and transportation. Exxon's recent Arkansas spillfrom a crude-oil pipeline break and Chevron's ongoing multibillion-dollar environmental lawsuit in Ecuadorhighlight the importance of responsible development in avoiding costly damages and a bad reputation. To start performing to their full potential, energy stocks need the support of stronger overall economic growth. Once the global economy starts firing on all cylinders, demand for oil and gas should start supporting prices and creating more profit for Exxon and Chevron. Meanwhile, so long as companies are looking for energy, GE stands poised to help them find it -- and take its fair share of the profits in the bargain.

Data source: MasTec, Inc. What happened with MasTec this quarter? Oil and gas fueled the expectation-beating earnings results: Revenue was at the high end of the company's guidance range of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings were $0.09 per share above the high end of its $0.17 to $0.27 per share guidance range. Revenue growth was strongest in the company's communications segment, with revenue surging 26.3% to $592.2 million. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA in the segment grew by 37% to $66.6 million. While revenue in the oil and gas segment only grew 3.7% to $425.6 million, adjusted EBITDA jumped 36.8% to $56.5 million. Those strong earnings fueled MasTec's expectation-beating results. Electrical transmission revenue grew 23.3% to $95 million; however, that segment's adjusted EBITDA was a negative $7.8 million. Still, that is a vast improvement from last year's negative $21.4 million in adjusted EBITDA. Power generation and industrial revenue also jumped -- up 16.1% -- however, adjusted EBITDA slumped 40% to $4.8 million. What management had to say CEO Jose Mas commented on the company's results, saying: Our second quarter results significantly exceeded our expectations, primarily due to improved productivity in our Oil & Gas segment. We expect record levels of Oil & Gas segment revenue during the second half of 2016 as we further ramp execution on large projects initiated at varying times during the 2016 second quarter. Most importantly, we have clear visibility to opportunities in the Oil & Gas segment which we expect will drive continued growth in 2017 and beyond. It is also important to note that in addition to the strong 2016 second quarter performance in our Oil & Gas segment, we also experienced significant growth in our Communications segment, and began to see improvement, as expected, in our Electrical Transmission segment. We expect these positive trends to continue, driving improved revenue and operating margin performance during the second half of 2016. One of the big drivers during the quarter was the ramp up of construction of two pipelines the company is building near the Mexico border to increase U.S. natural gas exports to that country.

721,"Energy Stock Roundup: Investors Bet Big on Donald Trump and OPEC (CLD, CIE, HNRG, TESO, BXE)",fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 08:00:00,"The rhetoric from the presidential candidate and the oil cartel drove double-digit rallies in Cloud Peak Energy, Cobalt International Energy, Hallador Energy, Tesco, Bellatrix Exploration last week. YCharts So what As coal producers, last week's rallies of Cloud Peak Energy and Hallador Energy had nothing to do with OPEC's rhetoric. Instead, an energy speech by presidential candidate Donald Trump fueled the coal stock rally after he promised an ""America first"" energy policy, which would roll back regulations hurting the country, and coal producers like Cloud Peak Energy and Hallador Energy in particular. Further, he promised to restore America's coal sector to greatness, which would imply better days ahead for Cloud Peak Energy and Hallador Energy if Trump wins the election. Cobalt International Energy, meanwhile, jumped not only due to rising oil prices, but it continued to ride last week's waveafter reaching an agreement with drilling contractor Rowan Companies ( NYSE:RDC ) to terminate a lease one year early. Doing so will save the company $80 million through 2018, which is critical for the cash-strapped company. That said, Cobalt International Energy did agree to use Rowan as its exclusive drilling contractor for the next five years, which could end up costing it more money in the long run. Canadian oil and gas producer Bellatrix Energy, on the other hand, not only rallied thanks to the OPEC-inspired oil price rally, but due to an asset sale. The company announced on Monday that it sold its non-core Pembina assets for $47 million in cash. Bellatrix Energy plans to use the cash proceeds to repay debt. Finally, the move higher by oil-field service company Tesco's stock was primarily driven by OPEC. That is because higher oil prices are a critical factor to drive a market recovery, which would improve demand for Tesco's tubular services and products. As such, investors are betting that OPEC will intervene this week, which would help restart Tesco's earnings growth. Now what The problem with these rhetoric-driven moves is that it is entirely possible neither comes to fruition. Trump might not get elected and even if he does he might not make coal great again. Likewise, OPEC might not move, and even if it does it still might not stabilize the oil market. That is why investors are better off steering clear of stocks that are moving based on hope instead of tangible improvements in market fundamentals.

722,One Oil Giant is Betting Big on Wind Energy,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 07:47:00,"Statoil's sale of Canadian oil sands assets to invest in wind energy is a sign of where energy investments are headed. Dec 22, 2016 at 8:47AM Author Bio Travis Hoium has been writing for fool.com since July 2010 and covers the solar industry, renewable energy, and gaming stocks among other things. Oil and gas giants are starting to take a lot more interest in renewable energy than they have for decades, and it could mean a huge shift in direction for the industry. The latest sign of change was Statoil ( NYSE:EQNR ) , the $59 billion oil giant, selling its Kai Kos Dehseh (KKD) assets in Alberta's oil sands and then winning a wind lease off the coast of New York. This is an incredible turnaround for any energy company, moving from some of the dirtiest oil production in the world to some of the cleanest energy available. And it's a sign of the times in energy. Image source: Getty Images. Selling out of Canadian oil sands The sale of KKD assets was made to Athabasca Oil Corporation for CAD 832 million, about 80% of which is in cash now or after contingencies. What's notable is that the sale will trigger between $500 million and $550 million in impairment charges for Statoil on money lost on the oil sands investment. This will leave Statoil with no oil sands assets anywhere in the world, a shift from a few years ago when oil sands was viewed as a big growth driver for the oil industry. Wind enters the equation The wind lease Statoil won is off the cost of Long Island in New York (shown below) in 79,350 acres of water. The winning bid for the lease was $42.47 million. Image source: Statoil. Statoil thinks the space could accommodate over 1 GW of wind projects, which would likely cost in excess of $2 billion, although the initial plan will be to build 400 MW to 600 MW of wind turbines. This will be a new type of development in the U.S., with the 30 MW Block Island Wind Farm the first wind project completed in the U.S. just last week. The New York lease also adds to Statoil's 40% stake in the Sheringham Shoal wind farm in the U.K., which has been in operation since 2012. It also has two projects under construction in Scotland and Germany. Why the move to wind? On the surface, it may seem odd that an oil giant with production of 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day is making billions of dollars of investments in wind energy. But energy companies are looking for growth in markets that provide more stable returns than oil projects, which have becoming incredibly expensive and risky. Wind provides predictable cash flows for decades, so the return on investment has much less risk than oil and gas projects do. An oil explorer like Statoil with decades of experience developing offshore assets could bring some expertise to the table as well. Wind turbines are still largely an on-shore business so the more expertise a developer has off-shore the better. There isn't a lot of crossover between oil & gas and wind, but this is a place where moving into wind makes sense. French oil company Total NYSE:TOT ) is another big oil company that's investing in renewables, although it's focusing on solar through its majority-owned subsidiary SunPower. Not only does Total own two thirds of SunPower, it's buying projects from SunPower and even co-developing in regions like Africa and the Middle East. Like wind projects, these solar projects provide a predictable rate of return. It's telling that big oil companies are starting to pay more and more attention to renewable energy. Part of the reason is that they see less opportunity in their traditional markets, but this also shows how wind and solar are now mainstream energy sources, even for big oil. And that's a shift that seemed unimaginable just a few years ago. Motley Fool Returns",https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/22/one-oil-giant-is-betting-big-on-wind-energy.aspx
723,3 Little-Known Oil and Gas Companies to Put on Your Radar,fool,"Apr 11, 2021",2021-04-11 07:15:00,"Parsley Energy, Core Laboratories, and Atwood Oceanics may not be household names, but they are companies investors should get to know. NYSE:PE ) isn't well known by most investors just yet. That gives investors who are looking where others are not the opportunity to buy an up-and-coming oil company before the rest of the market realizes its potential. One thing that sets the company apart is its founder, Bryan Sheffield, who is a third-generation oilman and son of Pioneer Natural Resources' ( NYSE:PXD ) CEO Scott Sheffield. That's noteworthy because Scott built Pioneer into one of the premier drillers in the Permian Basin. Given his father's success, Brian has wisely chosen to follow in his father's footsteps as he builds a premier oil company in America's best oil basin. Like Pioneer, Parsley Energy's game plan is to acquire as much prime drilling land as it can in the basin to set it up for robust growth in the years ahead. Furthermore, the company is following Pioneer's plan of issuing equity to fund acquisitions and capex instead of debt, which weighed down most of their rivals in recent years. As a result, Parsley has maintained a low leverage rate throughout the downturn, which enabled it to deliver remarkable growth at a time when many producers are in decline. In fact, despite the worst oil market in decades, Parsley Energy has been able to grow its production by a stunning 68% over the past year. This is not growth for the sake of growth, evidenced by the fact that its wells are generating a 60% to 90% rate of return due to relatively low drilling costs and excellent production rates. With an enterprise value of $7 billion, Parsley Energy is a fraction of the size of most oil companies, causing it to remain under the radar of most investors. However, it might not stay there for long because it has a game plan to not only grow its size but earn exceptional returns along the way. Helping to produce better and earning high returns in the process : People in the oil and gas industry may recognize the name Core Laboratories ( NYSE:CLB ) , but it's not exactly a name that many outside the business will recognize. Core's business is analyzing data from prospective and developed oil and gas reservoirs to better determine how to make that well or reservoir more productive and economical. The fact that the company provides a service that improves profitability for producers means that it has a little bit more pricing power than some other oil services companies that provide more commoditized services. What makes Core a compelling investment is that management uses the advantage of providing a specialty service that commands a higher price and turns it into extremely high returns for investors. Even today in what is considered an extremely challenging market for oil and gas companies, Core Labs is still able to convert 23% of its revenue to free cash flow and generate returns on capital invested greater than 20%. This may be a bit of a rough patch for Core and the rest of the industry, but the company has shown that it can continue to produce results on a much smaller revenue base. As drilling activity returns to normal, more and more producers will employ the services of Core to either help better categorize their projects under development or  increase production at existing wells. When this does happen, investors will likely reap large rewards.

Michelle Lujan Grisham is pushing for an exemption from the Biden administrations pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands. An exemption would Save I am alarmed that Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is pushing for an exemption from the Biden administrations pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands. An exemption would be detrimental to local communities, our natural heritage and the future of our planet. The governor is a grandmother now, and I believe she wants to protect our Earth for her grandchildren and all of our children. New Mexico should not be exempted from federal climate mandates. Lujan Grisham has shown national leadership on renewable energy, however building more solar panels alone will not solve our climate crisis; we must also systematically draw down our emissions. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the United States will need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030. To reach this goal, all states should be part of Bidens plan for reducing emissions. A moratorium on fracking leases on public lands is a first step to drawing down emissions, but it will not halt industry. In New Mexico, there are 60,000 active oil and gas wells, with more than 31,000 wells on federal public lands. In the Trump era, the oil and gas industry stockpiled 5,000 new, but unused, federal drilling permits. They will take years for industry to extract. Bidens proposed moratorium will not stop production from wells on already-leased lands. So the oil and gas industrys fearmongering is unfounded. Greenhouse gas emissions lead to hotter and drier weather in the Southwest. The last decade has been the hottest ever recorded. In 2021, New Mexico is heading into a severe, historic drought. Large portions of the Rio Grande will run dry, and farmers have been asked not to plant. Even in the face of this local crisis, New Mexican politicians are not passing climate legislation. Many are still protecting the interests of oil and gas corporations. It is time to protect our water, air and lands for our communities. As a mother, I am painfully aware of our dwindling carbon budget, before we hit catastrophic climate tipping points. We have the chance now to draw down emissions and protect our Earth. Now is the time for bold leadership and ambitious solutions to address climate. I am calling on the governor and our elected officials to join with the Biden administration and our new secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland, in protecting our public lands and curbing our greenhouse emissions.

726,The 5 Best Places in the World for Oil and Gas Investment,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 23:00:00,"Industry professionals weigh in on the top spots. Updated: Apr 7, 2017 at 12:59PM Published: Sep 16, 2012 at 12:00AM Author Bio Follow @TMFDuffy Earlier this year, the Fraser Institute disseminated its Global Petroleumsurvey to managers and executives of exploration and production companies around the world. The responses came in, and with them a wealth of information. Today I'll take a look at the survey's results for the five best places on Earth for oil and gas investments. 5. Manitoba This is Canada's only province in the top five, surprising giving Alberta's prominent role in developing oil sands (that province ranked 21st in the survey). But Manitoba has a booming energy business as well, and as the survey results pointed out, the government has recently begun focusing on attracting investment. Manitoba borders North Dakota and thus reaps the benefits of shale oil, just like its American neighbor. In 2011, the province produced a record 14.8 million barrels of oil, topping the previous record of 11.7 million from the year before. The largest producer in Manitoba is a privately held Canadian company called Tundra Oil & Gas, which generates about 40% of the province's oil production. 4. North Dakota Production in North Dakota has been on a tear, and the state recently surpassed Alaska and California and now ranks second among all U.S. states in oil production. The most recent numbers show that oil production in the state reached 674,000 barrels per day in July. Oil production has increased since last April, and output has doubled since last May. Most of the production is coming from the state's shale oil plays, specifically the Bakken Shale. Continental Resources (NYSE: CLR) is the top leaseholder in the Bakkenand the top producing outfit in the Williston Basin. The company averages 100,000 barrels per day and has increased its reserves by 20%, which just outpaces the 19% growth of its share price this year. 3. Texas Opportunity abounds in Texas. It's the sort of place where Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) , a pipeline company, can also be the state's second-largest oil producer Texas is the country's top oil-producing state, and there are an awful lot of energy companies headquartered in Houston. Aside from its powerful refining sector on the Gulf Coast, the state is also home to the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford, two of the hottest oil plays in the country right now. Survey respondents were keen on Texas because of the lack of obstacles in its regulatory environment and its ""good infrastructure and support services."" 2. Mississippi Mississippi is a bit of a sleeper on this list. Often playing second fiddle in the media to its Gulf Coast neighbors, the state actually has a substantial energy business. Mississippi is part of the Gulf Coast's big refining business. In fact, Chevron's (NYSE: CVX) Pascagoula refinery is one of the top 10 largest refineries in the United States, processing 330,000 barrels of crude oil a day. But perhaps most important in the eyes of E&Ps is that there have been new oil and gas deposits discovered in recent years that point to a high energy future for Mississippi. 1. Oklahoma First overall, Oklahoma also ranked first in the survey's commercial environment index, meaning that respondents found it the best place to invest when considering six specific factors: fiscal terms, taxation regime, trade barriers, quality of infrastructure, labor availability, and corruption. Oklahoma is home to the Mississippi Lime oil and gas play a low-cost, high-return dream come true for E&Ps. The biggest player in the Lime right now is Sand Ridge Energy (NYSE: SD) , which plans to drill 380 wells in the lime by the end of this year. Success begets success, and investors looking to cash in on Sand Ridge and Oklahoma should also consider Plains All American Pipeline (NYSE: PAA) . The midstream outfit is in the process of constructing a 170-mile pipelineto carry Sand Ridge's oil from the Lime to the industry hub at Cushing, Okla.

You'll often find him writing about Obamacare, marijuana, drug and device development, Social Security, taxes, retirement issues and general macroeconomic topics of interest. And you thought the days of corporate excess and money mismanagement were long gone with the dot-com crash in 2001! Deepwater oil and exploration company ATP Oil & Gas (Nasdaq: ATPG) actually went public in 2001 and, through a series of project delays, an insurmountable pile of debt, and a few unfortunate events, now sits on the precipice of a bankruptcy filing, according to Bloomberg ATP, at one point, was flying high. In 2007, its share price topped out at $57, and then CEO and current chairman Paul Bulmahn gave each of his 52 employees the perk of a round-trip ticket to Sweden to go pick a new Volvo for themselves, or $25,000 in cash. At the moment, ATP sure could use those frivolous cash expenditures back. However, when the credit crisis and subsequent recession hit, oil prices collapsed and demand dried up, essentially crippling the company. In the years that have followed, things have only gone from bad to worse. The Deepwater Horizon oil spillin 2010, which was owned by Transocean (NYSE: RIG) , but leased out by BP, resulted in a six-month deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, considerably more stringent deepwater drilling regulations, and very limited permit licensing once the ban was lifted. The repercussions of the spill are still being felt, with ATP having multiple project delays in the Gulf, where it operates the majority of its rigs. Yet, many drillers, including Ensco (NYSE: ESV) , have returned to fully-operational statusin the region. There were a few glimmers of hopeover the years, as ATP discovered natural gas reserves totaling up to 2.3 trillion cubic feet off the coast of Israel, in conjunction with drilling partner, Isramco (Nasdaq: ISRL) . Between the Shimshon well discovery and expected improvement in the Clipper fieldof the Gulf of Mexico, many investors figured the company would just refinance its debt, and increase productivity to boost cash flow. Things just didnt work out that way. As of its most recently finished quarter, ATP boasted about $2 billion in debt, $1.5 billion of which was due in May 2015and accrued interest a ridiculous 11.875% rate per year. ATP, facing the prospect of an $89 million interest payment in November, and with very little cash left in its coffers, appears to have turned (according to reports) to Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS) for a $600 million bridge loan to allow it to operate during possible bankruptcy proceedings. Again, these are unconfirmed rumors as of Friday evening, but they are enough to send the stock screaming lower by 73%. What the ATP story came down to was, simply, a case of a company that expanded beyond its own means, imprudently utilized its cash on hand, and couldnt generate positive cash flow The year 2002 was the last time that ATP generated positive cash flow, while burning through more than $3 billion in cash between 2003 and 2011. Even if ATP survives the week without filing for bankruptcy, and this all turns out to be an elaborate rumor, its facing a nearly impossible uphill battle in refinancing and repaying its debt load, with the cash constraints needed to rectify its many production delays and developments. Its also not going to be able to file its second-quarter results on time, and doesnt have a clue when it will be able to. ATP proves, once again, that its only a matter of time before imprudent spending catches up with unprofitable companies. Cest la vie, ATP  it was nice knowing you!

Source: Yahoo! Finance. What's a royalty trust? A royalty trust is similar to a REIT but income is derived from oil and gas rights instead of real estate or mortgages. As long as the trust pays out 90% of earnings as distributions to shareholders, the trust can avoid corporate income taxes. With this special treatment, however, comes special tax reporting requirements, so be aware of that prior to purchasing royalty trusts. Their assets also deplete over time, so the income is not guaranteed to last beyond the life of the trust, and in some cases, shares become completely worthless when the trust ends. That said, Enduro Royalty Trust is brand-new, offered to investors in November 2011. Ownership provides the opportunity to share in the profits of oil and natural gas production from the trust's properties in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. San Juan Basin Royalty Trust is the largest U.S. royalty trust, also benefiting from production in New Mexico. Finally, Permian Basin Royalty Trust provides investors with a share of income from two properties in Texas. Two Canadian options Both Baytex Energy and Provident Energy are set up similar to the royalty trusts mentioned above. One difference is that they are based in Canada, but they also produce some of the oil and gas they sell. This is different from the U.S.-based royalty trusts, which are usually set up by banks solely to distribute the proceeds from other producers. Baytex Energy engages in the acquisition, development, and production of oil and natural gas in Western Canada and North Dakota. Formerly a trust, it acquired assets the past few years that led to it becoming more active in the actual production of oil and natural gas. Provident Energy has assets focused on three of the most important North American energy plays: the Alberta oil sands, the Bakken shale, and the Marcellus shale. Because of this, Pembina Pipeline announced its plan to purchasethe Canadian energy company last month. Dividends are great Though these aren't dividend payers in the traditional sense, their monthly dividend-like distributions could be used to pay some monthly expenses. In addition, they are a nice way to get some exposure to oil and natural gas in a world defined by fossil fuels.

In a business that is incredibly capital intensive, energy companies have begun to fund production costs by creating royalty trusts focused on a specific region or play. These trusts can be complicated from a tax and paperwork perspective, but they are fairly simple to understand otherwise: Oil and gas comes out of the ground; money goes into your pocket.

Updated: Apr 6, 2017 at 2:04PM Published: Feb 10, 2010 at 12:00AM I first introducedFools to Contango Oil & Gas (AMEX:MCF) and its CEO, Ken Peak, back in 2007. The exploration and production company more recently weighed in as my runner-up for Best Stock for 2010 On a risk-adjusted basis, there may be no better bet in the oil patch. Ken Peak is one of the largest shareholders of Contango, which he founded in 1999. Before that, Ken had a long career elsewhere in the oil patch, including a stint as chief financial officer of Forest Oil (NYSE:FST) . He also served as an officer and cryptologist in the U.S. Navy. His various presentations have drawn on the wisdom of Warren Buffett, Alice in Wonderland, Nassim Taleb, and The Big Lebowski. I just had to get this guy in front of a Foolish audience. An email exchange resulted in the following interview. Toby Shute: Ken, can you outline your operating philosophy at Contango, and describe how your current operations reflect that philosophy? Ken Peak: I got a Ph.D. in the risks of too much leverage ... in my 26-year career prior to starting Contango in 1999. Three guiding principles from the lessons I've learned are: Only low-cost producers survive and prosper in a commodity business. Secondly, reserves and geophysical talent are log-normally distributed, but [Vilfredo] Pareto had it wrong. It's the rule of 95/5 not 80/20. Thirdly, ""incentives drive behavior"" is a fundamental principle of life, and thus everyone associated with Contango must have incentives aligned with our owners. TS: In terms of an E&P's short-term (i.e., quarterly or annual) performance, what is the most important metric for investors to focus on? By that measure, how did Contango fare in calendar 2009, and how does that compare to the peer group? KP: I believe even thinking about short term performance is a diversion because it takes your focus off what is really important. Our business is not quarterly or annual. One needs a 3-7 year horizon -- this is difficult, I know, because it forces shareholders to think as owners. TS: Contango appeared alongside XTO Energy (NYSE:XTO) and Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN) among the decade's best performing stocks That's one clear indicator of your long-term success. Aside from looking at a stock chart, how can an investor judge whether an E&P company has done well by its shareholders over the long haul? KP: We live in a capitalist society -- the only point of being in business is to make a profit. We measure how successful investments are by their rate of return. I define rate of return as some profit number in the numerator divided by some investment number in the denominator. My two favorite return measures are the eponymous ""Peak Ratio,"" defined as shareholder earnings divided by net invested capital, and ""Peak Market Cap,"" defined as market capitalization divided by net invested capital.

732,Gas Up Your Big Oil Portfolio,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 23:00:00,"Really cheap oil is gone for good, but gas prices will rise and could make you rich. Updated: Apr 6, 2017 at 5:59PM Published: Nov 3, 2011 at 12:00AM Author Bio A longtime securities analyst and multiple-term member of The Wall Street Journal's All-Star Research team, Dave specializes in energy and natural resources. Last week, my Foolish colleague Alex Planes wrote a superb articleoffering the conclusion that ""Cheap Oil Isn't Coming Back,"" an assessment with which I completely agree. Beyond that, though, I'd add, ""And Cheap Gas Has a Brief Future, Too."" With that in mind, it's crucial to look back at the recent earnings season to garner what we can about which major oil companies appear to offer the biggest boosts for our portfolios. Earnings season typically involves similar results for virtually all of Big Oil -- which we probably should begin referring to as Big Oil and Gas. Barring the unusual, the factors driving companies' quarterly successes -- or lack thereof -- are generally led by commodities prices and downstream (refining) margins, which tend to be similar for all the integrated companies. As such, quarterly performances generally do little to separate the investment wheat from the chaff. But the past quarter was somewhat different. With more variety among the metrics, the expanding importance of geopolitics, and some changes clearly in store for the trading of the commodities, it's become easier to discern a hierarchy among the large integrated companies. Indeed, I think we can identify a trio of companies that smart Fools (Iis there another kind?) simply can't ignore. Chevron's up first by looking at Chevron (NYSE: CVX) , which brought up the rear by waiting until last Friday to report its numbers. Nevertheless, it managed to overcome a 5% slide in its daily production and rode the combination of higher crude prices and stronger refining margins to more than double last year's third-quarter earnings. Fortunately, the production slide was temporary, based largely on maintenance outages and pipeline problems in the Far East. As such, I'm inclined to provide Chevron a spot among our powerhouse threesome. And there are other key reasons to like the company. In the Gulf of Mexico alone, to the extent that the pokey permitting process allows, Chevron is as busy as a proverbial cat in a ... well, you know. There's the big, decade-old Tahiti field, from which output is still being increased as part of this year's effort to reach about 2.80 million barrels of oil equivalent per day worldwide. Beyond that, the company is endeavoring to start up a couple of other big Gulf fields -- Big Foot and Jack/St. Malo -- by 2014. That, of course, assumes it can make up for the time lost because of BP's (NYSE: BP) Macondo well tragedy last year. No pain from this gas But as I indicated, those companies with abundant activity in natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) -- both in the U.S. and abroad -- stand an increased chance of adding shekels to our portfolios. That's another aspect of Chevron's strength. In Western Australia, as you'll recall, it holds a 47% position in the massive $43 billion Gorgon LNG project, where it's joined byExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) (NYSE: RDS-B) , each of which has a 25% stake. Then there's the Wheatstone LNG project, also in Western Australia, and also with Chevron at the helm, with 73.6%. Apache (NYSE: APA) , Shell, and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration  -- Kufpec -- have divvied up the remainder. The $29 billion project has been targeted for start-up in 2016, when the first shipment is likely to head for Japan. As if big positions in both Gorgon and Wheatstone weren't enough, just last week Chevron's Australian subsidiary announced yet another discovery -- this time in the Carnarvon Basin, making for the company's 11th discovery in the area in the past two years. And on the other side of the world, Chevron, along with Exxon and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) , are among those having received nods to search for natural gas in Poland and, in Chevron's case, Bulgaria. Shell's full of LNG Royal Dutch Shell also doubled its earnings in the past quarter, chalking up a growth rate that one advertisement used to refer to as ""a silly millimeter"" beneath Chevron's. The company is casting a major lot with LNG, where it leads the world in production and distribution. That's a sufficient reason for placing the Anglo-Dutch giant next to Chevron as another member of Big Oil's most promising trio. As an indication of the potential in natural gas -- obviously including LNG -- Shell's gas earnings jumped by a whopping 40% outside the Americas, while they eked out just a 1% increase in this part of the world. A large part of that massive differential stemmed from the fact that gas is sitting near a paltry $4 in the U.S., while it yielded $15 for Shell in Asia. That being the case, should we deny that the U.S. price is headed for higher ground? Indeed, Asia's levies appear to be headed even higher. By golly, we're in the LNG game Indeed, our country apparently is about to join the world of exporting LNG. Just last week, BG Group, a gas-centric company based in Reading, U.K., reached a pact with Cheniere Energy Partners (AMEX: CQP) to buy LNG from a Gulf Coast facility. It appears that BG will spend about $8.2 billion with Cheniere during a 20-year period beginning in 2015. With this contract having been salted away, and given the tremendous expansion in our country's natural gas reserves, I'm willing to wager my eldest son that the new BG-Cheniere pact will become one among many in short order. I won't become overly descriptive about the third member of the majors' most powerful trio. You probably won't be surprised that ExxonMobil has nailed down that position, largely by having spent $41 billion slightly more than a year ago to acquire Fort Worth-based XTO Energy, a major gas producer. The acquisition, which has subsequently been added to, turned the biggest of Big Oil into the major domo of Big Oil and Gas. Beyond that, last week the company advised the world that it had come upon a possibly significant gas discovery off the coast of central Vietnam. Be careful where you step So we now have our select Big Oil and Gas trio. Are all the companies equally attractive? Probably not, and here's why: I mentioned geopolitics earlier, and I frankly am concerned about Iraq's future for the companies, even in the short term. I simply can't see how we can force essentially all U.S. troops to skedaddle from the country and not be faced with eruptions emanating from next-door neighbor Tehran. I won't say more about the subject -- I don't work for the State Department -- except to note that, (importantly) unlike Exxon and Shell, Chevron has steered clear of the war-torn country. (Instead, it's the only member of Big Oil with an upstream gig with Saudi Arabia's Aramco.) And then there's Russia. Several years ago , I began a Motley piece with the observation, ""Only a few things are absolutely inevitable in today's world: death, taxes, and the Russian government's lusting after energy projects once th",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/11/03/gas-up-your-big-oil-portfolio.aspx
733,Kansas Has a Fracking Good Time With Oil and Gas Exploration,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 23:00:00,"New plans for south-central Kansas could expand the pie for several companies. , and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK) are all leasing thousands of acres in south-central Kansas in preparation for a major hydraulic fracturing effort. Chesapeake has a significant presence in the Anadarko basin, where oil flows have increased at a faster rate than the company's natural gas production. Chesapeake's commitment to unconventional plays makes it an ideal operator in an area of the state that's thus far been underutilized due to the higher costs of extraction. SandRidge is in a similar position, but has a stronger foothold in south-central Kansas, which is the northern part of the Anadarko shelf, in which the company has leased a million acres. Frack daddies Much of the state is well-explored (pardon the pun), as nearly a quarter-million wells have been sunk in Kansas since 1947. The state's lax fracking policies are doubtlessly attractive; Kansas requires no disclosure of the chemicals companies use in the fracking process. Even historically pro-drilling Texas has adopted chemical disclosure rules for 2012. Will that non-policy be maintained as the procedure comes under greater scrutiny? With 90% of Kansas' future wells slated to use hydraulic fracturing techniques, the state's largest natural gas producers also have a stake in what happens in southern Kansas, regardless of whether or not they drill in the area.

Dividend Sector Review: Oil & Gas How do oil and gas company dividends stack up? Todd Wenning Updated: Apr 6, 2017 at 9:51PM Given paltry yields on savings and high-quality bonds, it's easy to see why dividend stocks are getting more attention these days. Though dividend-paying stocks have a much different risk profile than CDs or Treasuries, a well-diversified portfolio of quality dividend stocks can help boost your current income and provide income growth potential through dividend increases. Not just any dividend-paying stocks will do, however, and it's important to take a holistic approach to evaluating these opportunities. That's one reason that I created the Dividend Report Cardlast year, which looks at metrics like dividend history, payout ratios, and interest coverage to determine the sustainability and growth potential of a company's dividend. Today, I'd like to take a bird's-eye view of dividend health at the sector level and take a gander at oil and gas companies. Sector overview According to Capital IQ, energy stocks have been the best performing group in the S&P 500 over the past year, posting 27.9% returns as a group. Much of these gains can surely be attributed to the rise in oil and gas prices over the same period. Last May, crude oil traded for approximately $75 per barrel, and, despite recent volatility, it is changing hands at $100 per barrel today. Still, the industry has a lot going for it, including increasing demand for energy across the global economy. Large oil and gas companies also have a vast amount of infrastructure, specialized knowledge, and scale that provide them with competitive advantages and significant barriers to entry A closer look The most important factor when considering the health of a company's dividend is the free cash flow payout ratio . In other words, you want to make sure a company has enough extra cash left over after reinvesting in the business to fund the dividend.

735,How to Play Ohio's Energy Boom,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 23:00:00,"Oil and gas are set to ramp up Ohio's economy. Updated: Apr 7, 2017 at 5:44PM Published: Apr 12, 2012 at 12:00AM Author Bio Follow @TMFDuffy Ohio is home to two shale formations, the Marcellus and the Utica. While the former's sweet spot for energy production is located mostly in New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, the best part of the Utica sits under the earth in Ohio. Development of this lucrative shale play is not nearly as far along as the Marcellus, but that is changing fast, creating a multitude of opportunities for investors to cash in. The state of Ohio The Ohio Department of Natural Resources estimates that the Utica shale contains 1.3 billion to 5.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil, and 3.8 trillion to 15.7 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. Ohio's economy is expected to surge as oil and gas companies move to exploit these resources. A study by Cleveland State University found that shale drilling will add $5 billion to the state's economy by 2014, creating 66,000 jobs. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has issued 132 drilling permits over the past six months. Though there are few producing wells in the Utica right now, the ones that are up and running are generating some very promising results. Chesapeake Energy had five wells in eastern Ohio produce 2.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas last year. One well alone produced 1.5 bcf, which is equivalent to 2% of Ohio's total natural gas production. As a result of the changes coming to Ohio via the energy industry, Gov. John Kasich has developed an energy policy that he hopes will be in place by June 30. The legislation includes rules governing well construction and hydraulic fracturing, as well as new payments that oil and gas companies will have to give to local governments. The new rules are unlikely to deter investment by the industry, especially the big players. Here are five companies making moves to cash in on Ohio: Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK) is the biggest landholder in the Utica, with close to 1.4 million acres. The company also holds 132 of the 179 drilling permits issued by Ohio since November 2010. Don't be surprised if Chesapeake opts to monetize more of its acreage at some point. At the end of December, the company sold a 25% stake in 619,000 acresto Total for $2.3 billion. Even after its most recent deals, analysts estimate Chesapeake is still $3 billion short of covering expenses this year. To this end, the company announced it expects to generate up to $10 billion in additional transactions this year. EV Energy Partners (NYSE: EVEP) recently inked a deal to develop a massive integrated midstream project with Chesapeake in eastern Ohio. The complex will bring much-needed infrastructure to the Utica for natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and NGL fractionation. It will also have terminal and rail loading facilities. EVEP will have an 8% stake in the project, which is expected to require an investment of $900 million over the next five years. EVEP controls 780,000 acres in the Utica, a portion of which it expects to monetize in the future. Gulfport Energy (NYSE: GPOR) was one of the first movers in the Utica shale. The company announced recently that it had completed the vertical stage of its first well and was starting a horizontal lateral. Gulfport's well is in the ""oily"" part of the shale, and the company plans to target oil only as it moves to drill 19 more wells this year. The company has 125,000 gross acres in Ohio and plans to spend $74 million there this year. Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI) plans to invest a cool $340 million in Ohio, beginning with a $40 million facility and $24 million in machinery and land development in Massillon. That project, expected to create 700 jobs over the course of three years, is moving full-speed ahead after the signing of a purchase agreement for 108.5 acres of land in the Northeast Ohio town. Clean Energy Fuels (Nasdaq: CLNE) expanded its network of liquefied natural gas fueling stations earlier this year by setting up shop in Seville, Ohio. The station is meant to serve a fleet of trucks for a local freight carrier, but is also available 24 hours a day for public use. Clean Energy's network now comprises 257 stations across the U.S. and Canada. The company plans to open 70 more stations this year across 33 states, including Ohio.

Image source: Getty Images. So what Key Energy Services tumbled more than 23% over the past week on the heels of its second-quarter report. That's after the oil-field service provider recorded an adjusted net loss of $29.4 million, or $1.42 per share, which was much worse than the $1.12 per share that analysts expected. Driving the weak result was further deterioration in its international businesses, which more than offset the fact that all its U.S. business segments generated positive underlying earnings thanks to the recovery in the U.S. shale market. While Key Energy Services noted that it sees opportunities on the horizon to capture the upside when market conditions improve, oil still hasn't stabilized to a level where its customers are comfortable ramping up activities. Meanwhile, both Plains All American Pipeline and Plains GP Holdings plunged 20% this week after reporting second-quarter results . Overall, the oil pipeline company booked $451 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was down 12% sequentially and 5% versus the prior year. The culprit was margin pressure on its oil and natural gas liquids marketing activities, which it expects will continue throughout the second half of the year. As a result, Plains All American Pipeline pulled back its adjusted EBITDA forecast from $2.26 billion to $2.08 billion. Furthermore, it warned that it might need to reduce its distribution from $2.20 per unit to $1.80 per unit, which would force its parent Plains GP Holdings to cut its payout as well. Finally, Smart Sand sank 20% this week after releasing its second-quarter results. The frack sand producer missed analysts' expectations on both the top and bottom line. While the company noted that revenue and earnings increased versus the first quarter, CEO Charles Young stated that ""our results were not where we wanted them to be."" Young noted that unplanned downtime at its Oakdale facility, operational inefficiencies due to the unavailability of railcars, and the timing of the completion of a third rail loop were all factors in results missing expectations. While Smart Sand believes it's getting these issues under control and sees heavy demand for its sand, there are increasing concerns that a sand glut might develop over the next year because rivals are boosting capacity which has the market worried that profitability in the sector could fall. Now what The market punished these companies because their results and guidance suggest that they are falling behind rivals that faced many of the same challenges but still overcame them. That's why, despite their lower stock prices, shares of these companies aren't the best to buy because they have internal issues that they must first fix.

So What: For Clean Energy Fuels to make its network of natural gas fueling infrastructure work, the price between a gallon equivalent of natural gas needs to stay well below the price of gasoline and diesel. Any day where the price of natural gas declines and oil jumps, Wall Street is going to give shares of Clean Energy a boost -- even if there's no reason why those two commodities are moving in the way that they are. There's also a little bit of optimism leading up to the company's earnings report this evening. Yesterday, the company announced that it was continuing to make progress on building out its infrastructure by announcing several smaller deals where the company will supply and maintain fueling equipment and natural gas to several clients in its three largest markets: public transit, long-haul trucking, and refuse collection. Now What: From a long-term perspective, the crude oil and natural gas price-spread change in a single day means absolutely nothing. With oil and gas prices moving so wildly from day to day, Wall Street could turn right around and take those gains back. So don't let today's price swing alter your opinion on the stock. The more important thing to watch here is the company's continued progress in signing deals like the ones outlined yesterday, and it's ability to turn that recurring revenue stream into a cash stream.

738,Why Industries Like Oil and Gas Are Turning to Solar Energy,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 13:00:00,"Solar power is providing needed energy to some surprising industries that you may think are competitors. Feb 28, 2015 at 2:00PM Author Bio Travis Hoium has been writing for fool.com since July 2010 and covers the solar industry, renewable energy, and gaming stocks among other things. Follow @TravisHoium You might think that the solar and oil and gas industries are in a heated war over the future of energy. In some ways, that's correct, but it doesn't begin to tell the complex relationship between the two industries. In fact, solar energy is starting to become a critical component to oil and gas and other industries that need off-grid power. As technologies like portable solar and energy storage improve, solar will provide energy to places that may seem unlikely for renewable energy. Image source: SunPower. Why off-grid solar is a big opportunity One of the problems with conducting operations like drilling for oil and gas or providing cell phone reception in remote locations in North Dakota, Texas, or even Canada is that energy isn't abundantly available to businesses. Electricity and natural gas don't necessarily make their way to your job site, meaning you have to bring in the energy you consume. This can be costly, not only to transport and store energy, but also just to run generators and set up your own energy infrastructure. Solar energy can provide a way to create energy onsite and energy storage allows you to use that energy all day long. SunPower ( NASDAQ:SPWR ) has made a couple deals in the off-grid business recently, one with Digicel Haiti and one with Verizon in the U.S. The Digicel project was for 14.4 kW worth of solar at 90 base stations around Haiti. SunPower is also building 10.2 megawatts of solar power at eight Verizon sites as part of a $100 million investment that will include fuel cells as well. But the solar energy is just scratching the surface of its potential in off-grid developments. Telecom is turning to solar energy on a large scale. Image source: SunPower. What could cause off-grid solar to explode What hasn't grown rapidly yet, but will play a big role in the future, is energy storage. SunPower is launching energy storage in residential applications and has its eyes on commercial energy storage as well. SolarCity ( NASDAQ:SCTY ) is a step ahead in that market with a product called DemandLogic that can provide backup power, lower demand charges (charged based on peak usage at a location), and even makes off-site solar feasible for round the clock usage. 2015 will likely be a transformative year for solar and energy storage. Dozens of companies are launching new storage products, including Tesla Motors ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) which is partnering with SolarCity. Tesla's Gigafactory is geared not only toward car batteries, but also units for energy storage. According to early plans, around 30% of capacity is planned for Tesla's energy storage product. This could be big business The sheer size of the potential off-grid market for solar is tremendous. There are as many as 1,900 drilling rigs active in the oil and gas market at any time and over 1.1 million active oil and gas wells. There are also around 190,000 cell phone towers in the country. It's difficult to say how far solar could reach into these markets, but if the solar industry can get to the point where they install just 2,000 off-site systems sized at 20 kW with energy storage the cost could be about $6 per watt. That's $240 million in potential revenue. Those are back of the napkin calculations but given the number of cell sites and oil wells it's probably a low estimate of the industry's potential. Keep an eye on off-grid solar solutions as a growth driver for SunPower, SolarCity, and even Tesla Motors. It's a market that has a lot of potential and it could become a standard in both industries.

741,Is This Shale Oil and Gas Play Overhyped?,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 11:00:00,"Despite the Utica shales impressive results for natural gas and related liquids, oil production results havent been all that encouraging. Mar 27, 2013 at 12:00PM Author Bio Arjun is a value-oriented investor focusing primarily on the oil and gas sector, with an emphasis on E&Ps and integrated majors. He also occasionally writes about the US housing market and Chinas economy. A couple of years ago, Chesapeake Energy's ( OTC:CHKA.Q ) outgoing CEO Aubrey McClendon touted the Utica Shale as ""the biggest thing to hit Ohio since the plow."" In mid-2011, he even went so far as to claim that the 1.3 million acres of Utica property that Chesapeake had leased contained hydrocarbons worth roughly $20 billion. But since that time, McClendon has scaled back his expectations about the Utica's oil potential substantially, as have executives at some other major companies operating in the play. This waning optimism, fueled by wells that yielded far less oil than initially expected, has led some commentators to question whether or not the play will live up to its initial hype. As Utica drillers continue to derisk their acreage, will they stumble upon huge reserves of oil? Or will the Utica's initial comparison to Texas' prolific Eagle Ford prove overblown? Let's take a look. Any black gold? Or just a lot of gas? To be sure, the Utica has yielded impressive quantities of dry gas and natural gas liquids thus far. But skeptics are worried that the play's proportion of oil to natural gas and related liquids may end up being disappointingly low. For instance, in the second quarter of last year, Devon Energy ( NYSE:DVN ) reported disappointing results from two wells it drilled in the oilier portion of the play. Arousing further suspicion that Devon may be giving up on the play, the company recently announced that it was looking to divest its Utica assets. In January, it placed some 244,000 of its gross acres (195,000 net) in the liquids-rich portion of the Utica in eastern Ohio up for bidding. Yet while Devon's retrenchment is discouraging, some operators' results give reason for hope and suggest that some portions of the Utica may be brimming with oil. For instance, Gulfport Energy ( NASDAQ:GPOR ) reported that its first 10 Utica wells averaged a peak rate of nearly 800 barrels of oil per day, plus 10 million cubic feet of natural gas and nearly 1,200 barrels of natural gas liquids. At any rate, it's tough to make a call on the Utica right now since the play is still very much in its infant stages and relatively very little is known about its various zones' geologies and productive potentials. Drilling thus far has been of the experimental kind, as producers seek to get a better understanding of their acreage. Contributing to the paucity of information about the play is Ohio's lack of transparency in releasing data on oil and gas wells drilled in the state. As a Reuters analysishighlighted, Ohio state regulators only require Utica operators to disclose production statistics on an annual basis. In contrast, most other states publicly disclose production statistics and drilling data on a monthly basis. Has the Utica's oil potential been overstated? The lack of data is compounding some investors' fears that the Utica may turn out to be a flop. Even Chesapeake, the first company to charge confidently ahead into the Utica, recently announced that it no longer views the play as central to its oil production growth. Initially, the company was unabashedly optimistic about the play's oil potential, even announcing in May of last year its plans to ramp up drilling activity significantly in the play's oilier portions. But in subsequent presentations and SEC filings, it has completely de-emphasized oil drilling in the Utica, instead reverting its stated focus toward drilling in the play's wet gas and dry gas windows. While only time will tell what the Utica's potential will actually be, the wide variation in different producers' well results suggests that the location of acreage will be crucial in determining the proportions of oil to natural gas and natural gas liquids. For instance, consider the fate of different operators in another highly publicized shale play  the Marcellus. Marcellus shows that acreage location matters big time With the domestic glut of natural gas having driven prices far below historical norms, producers operating in the Marcellus wet-gas window are faring relatively well, while rigs operating in the dry gas portions of the play have all but disappeared. For instance, Range Resources NYSE:RRC ) is planning on directing roughly 80% of its $1.3 billion capital budget toward drilling operations in the Marcellus. This is mainly because the company is aptly positioned in the wet-gas window of the play, which allows it to realize higher profit margins for its natural gas liquids production. Meanwhile, EXCO Resources (NYSE: XCO) has slashed its rig count from four to one and is heavily downsizing its regional headquarters. Similarly, Talisman Energy (NYSE: TLM) , which also currently only has one rig running in the play, has reduced its capital allocation to the Marcellus by 65% and instead diverted its focus to the oilier Eagle Ford Shale in Texas. The divergence in these companies' fortunes is a sobering reminder that it's not just the size of the acreage that matters What matters more is where those acres are located, the economics and productive potential of the underlying formations, and the mix of hydrocarbons they contain. The same is sure to be true for companies drilling in the Utica. Final thoughts Finding that crucial sweet spot, where oil flows as freely as wine in Napa Valley, will be the big challenge for Utica producers. However, as these companies continue to derisk their acreage, one or more is bound to stumble upon a lucrative oil window. In fact, Utica drillers may be closer than ever to zeroing in on this fabled zone. According to industry officials' comments earlier this month, a zone east of Interstate 77, which runs south from Portage County through Trumbull, Mahoning, and Columbiana counties and into Stark County, may represent the richest portion of the Utica's oil window. According to The Cleveland Plain Dealer, the spokesman for industry group Energy in Depth said that more core samplesfrom test wells and drilled wells are needed to better understand the regions liquids potential. As more tests are conducted and more data released, drillers should gradually be able to get a much better understanding of the Uticas oil potential. In addition, new production data set to be released next month by Ohio's Department of Natural Resources should provide a much better understanding of different zones' resource potentials, as well as offer a glimpse into which Utica drillers have secured the best acreage. Investors interested in the data can check it out on the DNR website Editor's note: In a previous version of this article, Energy in Depths Shawn Bennett was misquoted.

742,Look Out Below! These 5 Oil and Gas Stocks Got Hammered in February,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 11:00:00,"A recurring theme caused Range Resources, QEP Resources, Gulfport Energy, SM Energy, and Callon Petroleum to all drop by double digits last month. data by YCharts So what QEP Resources plunged after reporting a fourth-quarter loss of $0.56 per share, which was $0.34 per share less than analysts expected. One of the factors contributing to the miss was a 2% drop in production, including a 5% slide in oil output, though the company expects to reverse that decline next year. That weak report, when combined with slumping gas prices, was more than enough to fuel QEP's sell-off last month. Next up was SM Energy, which reported a net loss of $0.31 per share for the fourth quarter, though that was a $0.10-per-share improvement to what analysts expected. What seemed to bother investors last month were some of its other updates. First, the company said that it expected its Eagle Ford asset sale to close by the end of the month, but it subsequently postponed the closing until mid-March causing concern that the deal might not close. In addition, it put forth a growth-focused capital budget based on $55 oil and $3.30 gas. However, investors are starting to worry that it might need to revise that spending plan after gas prices plunged closer to $2.50 by the end of the month. Image source: Getty Images. Gulfport Energy also reported fourth-quarter results last month, earning $0.34 per share, which as $0.12 per share ahead of the consensus estimate. What investors didn't seem to like about the report was Gulfport Energy's plan to ramp up drilling activities and grow output by 45% to 53% per day this year, with natural gas accounting for 88% of that production. That gas-heavy forecast didn't sit well, especially given that gas prices plunged last month due to another warmer-than-normal winter causing investors to fear that supplies could grow out of control. Callon Petroleum also sold off following the release of its fourth-quarter results and 2017 guidance. While the driller did earn $0.08 per share, that was $0.02 per share below expectations after production not only missed its guidance but was well short of analysts' forecasts, which were toward the higher end of the range. On top of that, the company released an ambitious 2017 budget calling for capex in the range of $325 million to $350 million, which was more than analysts were expecting. Analysts fear that Callon Petroleum might be getting too aggressive, especially considering how fragile the oil and gas market are these days. Finally, Range Resources sold off last month largely due to declining gas prices. That's because the company's fourth-quarter results were solid, with earnings of $0.23 per share, which trounced the consensus estimate by $0.13 per share. However, like the others on this list, its gas-focused growth plan seems to have bothered investors the most. Overall, Range Resources plans to boost spending this year and organically grow production by 20%. However, with gas prices weakening, it's calling into question the logic behind growing output at such a rapid rate because rising supplies could put even more pressure on gas prices. Now what There was one overarching theme that fueled last month's sell-off in these five stocks: Each company is planning to boost production this year despite oil and gas prices remaining weak, with gas prices falling significantly last month due to tepid demand resulting from another warm winter. The concern is that these decisions to increase spending could come back to haunt these companies because the incremental output could put even more pressure on oil and gas prices, adding more weight to the stocks.

Oct 15, 2014 at 11:53AM Author Bio Reuben Gregg Brewer believes dividends are a window into a company's soul. He tries to invest in good souls. The United States energy industry has experienced a huge burst of growth over the last decade or so as once unprofitable to drill oil and gas regions have been opened up by technology and elevated prices. That's been most prominent of late on the shale oil front, where energy prices have remained relatively higha fact that's recently started to change. It might be time to examine the domestic natural gas market for some clues as to what could happen next. Going up, fast After hitting a low of around 1.83 billion barrels of oil produced in 2007, drilling in U.S. shale regions has led to a swift rise in production. Last year the United States produced almost 2.72 billion barrels of oil, a nearly 50% increase over the tally from about five years earlier. Source: EIA The rapid increase in supply led to some odd pricing. For example, the price relationship between Brent crude, a global oil benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a U.S. benchmark, started to break down in 2011. That's about the same time that shale oil production started to take off. Part of the problem is that U.S. producers have only limited access to international markets because of export restrictions. Complicating things further, shale oil production disrupted the normal flow of oil in the domestic market. That left some areas with more oil than they could use and created price discrepancies within the U.S. market, as well. But, because the global oil market has held up relatively well price-wise, U.S. oil had been propped up to some degree. And, thus, drilling for oil in U.S. shale regions remained a very profitable endeavor. In fact the price of WTI Crude had been in an upswing. But not anymore... so now what?",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/10/15/falling-oil-prices-could-stall-the-us-energy-boom.aspx
744,Is This Trend a Killer for Oil and Gas?,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 10:18:00,"Very interesting research released last week by the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that the domestic E&P sector may be headed for some difficult times. Oilprice.com -- the leading provider of energy news in the world. Very interesting research released last week by the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that the domestic E&P sector may be headed for some difficult times. The Administration calculated the spending habits of oil and gas firms operating within the U.S., tallying both incoming operational cash flow and outgoing capital expenditures for these companies. The results are surprising, revealing that today's oil and gas sector is spending well beyond its means. Just look at the chart below. 2013 operational cash flow for the industry ran approximately $575 billionwhile spending (""uses of cash"") averaged just under $700 billion, meaning that firms spent over $100 billion more than they made from operations. Source: EIA Of course, these metrics don't tell the complete story when it comes to company financials. E&P firms could, for example, make up the spending shortfall by selling assets and using the profits to shore up their bank accounts. But the EIA research reveals that's not the way many companies have been doing things, with numerous firms instead making up the difference in spending through increased bank borrowing. That means debt loads are growing across the industry, which sets up some interesting dynamics for the sector going forward. A lot is now riding on the future performance of U.S. fields. Today's E&P spenders are basically betting that increased capital outlays will pay for themselves through rising production and profits down the road. But the EIA numbers make this proposition look somewhat dubious. As the chart clearly shows, operational cash flows have been largely flat-lined for the last two years, with increased spending no longer giving the financials a lift. That's a very worrisome trend, which could see today's big spenders left with high and perhaps even unserviceable debt loads as oil and gas fields ""run on the treadmill."" This may be where the quality managers in the shale patch start to separate themselves from the pack.

746,"Oil and Gas Stock Roundup: Welcome Back, $50 Oil",fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 09:49:00,"A rebound in the oil market, and some company-specific news items, sent Cobalt International Energy, ConocoPhillips, Chesapeake Energy, Weatherford International, and Seadrill up double-digits this week. announced a deal to sell the bulk of its Canadian oil sands and Deep Basin gas assets to Cenovus Energy. The U.S. oil giant will receive an upfront cash payment of $10.6 billion along with $2.7 billion in Cenovus stock. Not only was the combined $13.3 billion sale price well above the company's $10.9 billion carrying value of the assets, but it's entitled to receive a quarterly payment based on oil prices for the next five years. ConocoPhillips intends to use its cash infusion to pay down debt and accelerate its share buyback program as it supercharges its value-creation strategy. Shares of Weatherford International jumped this week following the launch of a fracking joint venture with Schlumberger. The two oil-field service companies will combine their fracking assets into a new company, OneStim, with Schlumberger serving as the operator and 70% stakeholder while Weatherford will receive a 30% stake in the venture and a $535 million cash infusion to help it reduce debt. Analysts loved the deal, including Wells Fargo, which upgraded Weatherford to outperform, while Deutsche Bank reiterated its buy rating. Analysts, meanwhile, helped add fire to Chesapeake Energy's rally this week. Wunderlich put out a bullish note on the company, reiterating its buy rating and $10 price target. The analyst cited the company's ""compelling valuation alongside natural gas exposure, oil growth, and an improving balance sheet"" as catalysts. In particular, the analyst liked Chesapeake Energy's recent Powder River Basin well results, where a test well delivered 1,650 BOE/D, 70% of which was oil. The result suggests that Chesapeake's assets in the region could be a major oil growth driver as the company ramps up its activities. Image source: Seadrill. Finally, the rebound in oil prices back above $50 a barrel was all the fuel that beleaguered offshore-focused oil stocks Cobalt International Energy and Seadrill needed to see double-digit rallies this week. Both stocks have been under tremendous pressure due to the impact weak oil prices are having on their operations and ability to access capital. In Seadrill's case, it recently warned investors that it might have no choice but to file for bankruptcy protection as it seeks to shore up its balance sheet. Meanwhile, Cobalt International Energy is burning through cash as it works on its current offshore drilling program. As things stand right now, the company expects to spend between $550 million and $650 million this year, against just $50 million in revenue, leaving its year-end cash balance between $350 million and $450 million. That burn rate suggests that Cobalt International Energy will need another cash infusion within the next year to stay afloat, which will be a challenge considering the brutal offshore drilling market. That said, the rise in oil above $50 a barrel gave investors some optimism that market sentiment might turn and provide these companies with an opportunity to raise the cash they need to stay afloat. Now what While the rising tide of higher oil prices was the primary driver of this week's biggest movers, investors shouldn't lose sight of the fact that ConocoPhillips and Weatherford unveiled thesis-altering catalysts. In ConocoPhillips' case, it significantly improved its financial and operating metrics, which puts it in an even stronger position to thrive in the current market environment. Meanwhile, Weatherford received a much-needed cash infusion, which significantly improves its competitiveness. Those bold moves make both of those stocks worth a closer look despite this week's big rally.

752,Should You Own These 2 High-Yielding Oil and Gas MLPs?,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 08:26:00,"Upstream MLPs are beloved by investors for their high yields. This article takes a look at two lesser known oil and gas producers, among the highest-yielding in the industry, to see if they deserve a spot in your portfolio. 17.43% Sources: S&P Capital IQ, Yahoo Finance, MLPdata.com A note about the above information. The 10-year predicted distribution growth rate and total return data is skewed by the top three fastest-growing MLPs (which I'll discuss in a later article). Those three MLPs are the only ones with above-average growth rates, and removing them results in an average distribution growth rate of 2.46% and a predicted total return of 12.01% annually. The two key factors that stand out about QRE Energy (NYSE: QRE) and LRE Energy (NYSE: LRE) are their high yields and rock-bottom valuations. In fact, these two MLPs are the most undervalued partnerships in this industry, which is either a red flag or buying opportunity. This article will explore the likely reasons for these low valuations to determine whether they deserve to be on income investors' radar. Higher-risk MLPs QRE Energy has traded at a substantial discount for two reasons. First, prior to the buyout of its general partner, its management fee structure was horrendously disadvantageous to unit holders. Management was paid in units, and this resulted in high dilution of up to 10% per quarter. The recent buyout, despite resulting in a final 20% dilution, is spaced out over four years and is 7% accretive to DCF/unit. As such, it represents a catalyst for future distribution growth However, QRE Energy recently angered Wall Street by announcing a change in strategy. Rather than attempting to buy additional property with existing low-decline wells, it would increase its capital expenditures by 82% to increase its existing production. With a 10% annual production decline rate and $70 million needed to just maintain its current 19,000 barrels/day, the market is skeptical of management's decision to alter its acquisition based strategy, especially since its expansion projects aren't likely to result in distribution growth until 2016. LRE Energy is the second-smallest upstream MLP by production, but this might allow it to be a fast grower. For example its first quarter 2014 results are very impressive. Production up 7.9% year over year Adjusted EBITDA up 41% DCF up 68% Coverage ratio 1.02 Further reasons to like LRE Energy include its 5.2% increased production in April of 2014, seven consecutive quarters of distribution growth, and its sponsor, Lime Rock Resources. Lime Rock owns 37% of LRE Energy's units and has 54 million barrels of oil equivalent reserves it can drop down to LRE. This represents a potential 180% increase in reserves and potential growth catalyst. So why is LRE trading at a discount?",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/07/07/should-you-own-these-2-high-yielding-oil-and-gas-m.aspx
753,3 Top Energy Stocks to Buy in July,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 07:47:00,"Oil and gas are in high demand this summer, so now is a great time to invest in Hi-Crush Partners, Kinder Morgan, and MPLX. ) as great options to consider. Here's why they think these energy industry players are ripe to outperform. High prices at the pump may annoy drivers, but they're a sign of an energy industry recovery. Image source: Getty Images. Better discipline after a severe rebuke from the market Tyler Crowe (Hi-Crush Partners LP): Investing in commodities is by no means for everyone. The volatile and cyclical nature of these kinds of businesses can make for the occasional case of investment anxiety. Every once in a while, though, there is incredible value to be had in the right commodity at the right time. That's why shares of frack sand supplier Hi-Crush Partners LP look compelling today. Sand has always been an essential ingredient in the hydraulic fracturing process, as it keeps the fractured rock open to let oil flow through. As oil and gas drilling companies have honed the fracking process, they have drastically increased the amount of sand used per well. So much so that the average well drilled today used two to three times more sand than a few years ago. That means, despite there being fewer rigs drilling for oil and gas, demand for frack sand is higher today than it was before the oil price crash in 2014. That bodes incredibly well for Hi-Crush since it is one of the lowest-cost producers in the business, and it has a robust logistics and last-mile delivery service that has translated into high-margin sales Yes, the company suffered mightily when oil prices crashed and sand demand dried up. It had an overly ambitious expansion plan in place that led to too much debt on the balance sheet. It has repaired most of that damage, however, and has since been able to expand its operations while paying down debt, reinstating its distribution, and buying back shares. While there is always a possibility of another industry downturn, the company is in a much better position to handle tough times. Also, there is some evidence to suggest that we could be headed for a prolonged period of higher oil prices If so, then sand will remain a hot commodity and Hi-Crush Partners will likely benefit. Buy for the dividend, stay for the growth John Bromels (Kinder Morgan): For pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, the bounce is underway. After a lackluster 2017, and a pretty dismal start to 2018, the company's share price seems to finally be coming up off its March lows, when it briefly dipped below $15. What changed? Simple answer: the company's dividend. Management bumped the company's quarterly dividend by 60%, and that finally seems to have made the market sit up and take notice. Currently, it's yielding about 3.3%, and Kinder Morgan has indicated that more dividend hikesare in the cards. As a natural gas pipeline operator, Kinder Morgan makes most of its money through a tollbooth model, by charging companies to move their product through its pipelines. That ensures a reliable income stream, but it also means that significant growth needs to be achieved through big expansion projects, which usually require debt to finance. For a while, Kinder Morgan's debt seemed to be out of control, but the company has made some strides in recent years to shore up its balance sheet. That should free up resources that Kinder Morgan can use to fuel growth. With oil and gas prices high, and more petroleum products being drilled -- and shipped -- across the country, Kinder Morgan should be able to fund its growth plans and have enough left over to reward shareholders through dividend increases. That's a winning combination, but the market seems to be catching on, making July a great time to invest in this compelling growth story. A great company for a better price Matt DiLallo (MPLX): Pipeline and processing company MPLX went on sale last month after losing about 5% of its value, which pushed it down about 4% for the year. There's no logical explanation for the decline since oil prices have been on fire, which sent most energy stocks higher. Instead, the sell-off made an already excellent investment opportunity seem even better because it drove MPLX's high-yielding distribution up to 7.2%. That's an excellent yield considering the strength of MPLX's financial metrics. For starters, the company currently generates enough cash flow to cover that payout by a very comfortable 1.29 times, which is well above the average of its master limited partnership (MLP) peers. Further, the company also has solid credit metrics, which are right on par with the top-tier MLPs. Those factors suggest that MPLX can easily maintain its high-yielding payout. In fact, the company appears very likely to increase its distribution to investors at a healthy rate for years to come. MPLX already plans to boost its payout 10% this year, driven by $2.2 billion of fully funded growth projects currently underway. Meanwhile, the company has ample runway to continue expanding its existing footprint and may soon have additional acquisition opportunities come its way . Put it all together, and we have a top-tier high-yielding stock with ample growth ahead, all for a lower price. Which makes MPLX an ideal energy stock to buy in July.

754,Why Do Investors Put Up With Oil and Gas Madness?,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 07:00:00,"As Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron all announce income losses, investors continue to gloss over fundamental flaws in oil companies value proposition. NYSE:CVX ) had disappointing results, too, but they are full of confidence in their strategies for the future. Why on earth do investors believe that the same factors that were responsible for past failures will suddenly drive success going forward? High capex costs, tight margins, bad Juju The fundamental problem here is that oil and gas firms are spending more and more to get their hands on the same commodity. The times when you could scoop oil up with a pail are behind us. Now you have to jump through all kinds of crazy hoops to get at diminishing hydrocarbon reserves. Arctic drilling and oil sands exploration don't just anger environmentalists: they're horrendously expensive, and so far, they're not paying off at all. The payoff may never come. After dropping all that dough on these projects, Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron may never be able to burn a fair amount of what they extract. The mainstream is increasingly becoming aware of the potential for a carbon bubble which could strand hydrocarbon assets. Just look at how things wentat the recent World Economic Forum in Davos. The CEOs of major blue-chip companies were practically begging for climate change regulation. If regulators pursue some of the widely proposed measures -- such as putting a price on carbon -- the breakeven point on any extraction project changes dramatically. Then it becomes all about the cost curve and the most expensive exploration projects will be the first to fall to the inexorable power of economics. A little credit But first, let's give credit where it's due. Shell announced that it was backing away from its absurd plans to return to Alaska's Chukchi Seato revive its Arctic drilling activities. That's good, because watching Shell try to get back to the Chukchiwas like watching a train wreck in slow motion. It was a comedy of errors, and cutting its losses was the only possible call for Shell to make. Ben Van Beuren, Shell's new CEO, said the company planned in 2014 to focus more on profitability, rather than on increasing oil and gas output. That's welcome news, especially since Shell had a reserve replacement ratio of 131% in 2013, which means the company has a strong asset base to support it. Van Beuren said that Shell would work to enhance capital efficiency in 2014, with ""hard choices on new projects, reduced growth investment, and more asset sales."" Define insanity That's where the good news ends. While Shell is at least facing its maker a little bit, Chevron and ExxonMobil blithely shrugged off their 2013 income losses, chalking it up to the usual commodity-price volatility. ExxonMobil released a statement saying that the company had ""strong business results in 2013"" characterized by ""disciplined use of capital, project execution, and asset management."" Maybe ExxonMobil thinks that its late-2013 output rebound justifies such claims. The problem is that much of that uptick comes from a Canadian oil sands project, the cost of which ballooned well past budget, and which could come under immediate threat if carbon ever gets priced. It seems a fragile basket into which to put one's eggs. Meanwhile, Chevron is spending like a drunken sailor. Last year, Chevron pumped a stunning $42 billion into oil and gas projects and intends to up that by an additional $40 billion in 2014. This cash gusher was enough to freak out SEC regulators, who have demanded that Chevron explain why it thinks costs won't balloon even further, and why the company thinks its liquidity won't be compromised. Chevron says it'll get back to the SEC. All three companies are pushing ahead with other megaprojects that smack of desperation. Here's a little taste: The Gorgon : If you're picturing some freaky, snake-headed sisters turning onlookers to stone, well, that wouldn't be far off. The Gorgon is a 15 million-ton-per-year liquefied natural gas plant on Australia's Barrow Island. Chevron owns 47%, and Shell and ExxonMobil own about a quarter each. Its cost overruns are the stuff of nightmares. The project is 75% completed, and more than 45% over budget. Caspian Islands: Exxon and Shell are part of a consortium that aims to pump oil from man-made islands in the Caspian Sea. The project could cost $40 billion, where it was originally budgeted for $10 billion. The bird's-eye view This situation is screaming for a little perspective. Let's follow the thread. 1. In 2013, Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron together spent more than $120 billion to soup up their oil and gas output. The Wall Street Journal points out that in today's dollars, that's what it cost us to put a man on the moon. 2. The companies have yet to see a payoff and they may never if the carbon bubble scenario comes to pass. 3. A recent International Monetary Fund studyfound that the U.S. subsidizes fossil fuels more than any other country in the world, to the tune of $502 billion per year. That's a lot of taxpayer money about which nobody complains. 4. You know what taxpayers do complain about? Solyndra, the failed solar-panel company that President Obama's clean-technology program backed. You know what Solyndra cost taxpayers? Just $535 million. Where is the sense of scale? Why do we keep howling that renewables are too expensive and can't survive without government support, when the evidence that this is far truer of the fossil-fuel industry is staring us dead in the face? As long as Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron see themselves as oil and gas companies, they will be a losing prospect in the long run. They need to realize that they are, in fact, energy companies. Can you imagine how the world would look if they had invested even a fraction of that $120 billion in cleaner energy sources? It's time to take a long, hard look at oil majors' value proposition, and to recognize that it's built on a crumbling foundation.

755,Shell: Don't Turn Your Back on Oil and Gas,fool,"Apr 10, 2021",2021-04-10 06:35:00,"Shell's CEO recently explained why he's still big on oil and natural gas. Here's what you need to know before you give up on energy stocks. Nov 5, 2019 at 7:35AM Author Bio Reuben Gregg Brewer believes dividends are a window into a company's soul. He tries to invest in good souls. With a $238 billion market cap, Royal Dutch Shell ( NYSE:RDS.B ) is easily one of the world's largest integrated oil and natural gas companies. It has been working to increase its green credentials by investing in electricity assets and clean energy, but the vast majority of its portfolio is still in the oil & gas sector And according to CEO Ben van Beurden, it's going to stay that way for a very long time. Here's what you need to know. The oil backstory Shell's history dates to the late 1800s, when it started transporting liquid fuels by sea. One of the first companies to do so, Shell quickly found that it was a far more profitable business than the import/export trade it was doing elsewhere in the company -- including the import of, yes, shells from the Far East. And thus, Shell, the energy company, was born. Image source: Getty Images The company grew and expandens the entire energy sector, from the upstream(drilling for oil and natural gas) to the midstream(pipelines) to the downstream(refining and chemicals). These three businesses account for virtually all of the company's revenues. But carbon fuels are being displaced by cleaner alternatives, including solar and wind power. With more than a 100-year history behind it, Shell is used to shifting with the times. And today is no different, with the company slowly starting to dip its toe into the electricity space It isn't alone in this effort, with France's Total also making moves in the same direction. That said, Shell has been pretty clear that it wants to build its electricity-related business to the point where it stands toe to toe with its other energy investments. But the path to that goal isn't going to be quick, with the oil giant planning to invest only around $2 billion to $3 billion or so a year into the space. That may sound like a huge sum, but it's only about 10% of what the company normally spends on capital projects each year. Why not move faster? So Shell sees the clean-energy writing on the wall, but why isn't it moving faster to adjust its portfolio? After all, if the world were to switch to clean energy right now, Shell would be left with worthless investments in oil and natural gas. The energy company's CEO recently sat down with Reuters and explained that his company has no choice but to keep investing in carbon-based fuels, saying, ""Despite what a lot of activists say, it is entirely legitimate to invest in oil and gas because the world demands it."" That may sound at odds with what you see in the popular press, but it really isn't. The International Energy Agency (IEA) looks at the energy markets today and where they're likely to go in the future. This global energy watch group highlights that oil and natural gas make up roughly 50% of the global energy market today. That's a huge number, and one that can't change overnight because of the infrastructure built around it, notably including the vehicles -- cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes -- that carry people and products around the world today. Renewable-energy sources, by comparison, make up only 15% or so of global energy supply. Even in the future, oil and natural gas will remain very important. It's true that renewables will be the star of the show, growing quickly for decades into the future. But even if the world gets serious about reducing carbon emissions, the IEA projects that oil and natural gas will still be close to 50% of the energy mix in 2040. Coal, which is largely used to produce electricity, is going to see the greatest loss of share. That's the backdrop that led van Beurden to tell Reuters: ""One of the bigger risks is not so much that we will become dinosaurs because we are still investing in oil and gas when there is no need for it anymore. A bigger risk is prematurely turning your back on oil and gas."" Essentially, what he's saying is that oil and natural gas are still needed. It would be nice to simply drop them from the energy picture, but it can't be done overnight. It will take time to transition the world away from these vital energy sources. That fact bumps up against another one: Oil and natural gas are depleting assets. Once you pull either out of the ground, it's gone for good. You have to find new sources if you want more of it. So as older oil and natural gas fields run dry, you risk a supply shortfall if you don't keep drilling. And that's why Shell continues to spend billions of dollars a year on its oil and gas businesses.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/05/shell-dont-turn-your-back-on-oil-and-gas.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001

Image source: Getty Images. More of the same Reading through SandRidge's investor presentations, it wants to give the impression that it isn't the same company that went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in 2016. It says all the right things about lowering costs, getting better-than-expected results from its wells, and a plan to create long-term shareholder value. Unfortunately, this shareholder siren song doesn't really harmonize with its earnings results and some of the actions management tried to take recently. When the company emerged from bankruptcy completely debt free, the presented plan was to go away from its days of being a serial acquirer of prospective properties and focus on efficient drilling operations in its existing holdings. Instead, though, management immediately made an offer to buy Bonanza Creek Energy The deal was met with immediate blowback from several of its largest shareholders as one of the things that got it in trouble in the first place. To make matters worse, the company's current operations aren't exactly setting the world on fire. SandRidge has failed to turn a profit despite higher oil and gas prices; it's burning through its cash pile alarmingly fast, and will likely need some external funding to support just its current operations. Shares might look incredibly cheap, but management is already contemplating questionable moves, and current operations are still deep in the loss column at today's prices. There are plenty of profitable, well-positioned producersin the shale patch to choose from today to not have to take on the excessive risk at SandRidge. Years of digging, and it still isn't out of its financial hole I can't remember the last time Weatherford International wasn't in the midst of a corporate restructuring, some sort of ""portfolio optimization"" program, or whatever other fancy management term that can be used to describe turning around a foundering business. For the better part of this decade, the company has consistently struggled under the weight of its large debt load and the fact that its ability to generate cash from operations has been woefully weak. This is even after selling off several business lines and other assets to improve profitability and chip away at its debt load. The current iteration of a turnaround plan under CEO Mark McCollum is about one year old. Even though McCollum told investors to be patient at the start, there are hardly any tangible resultsfrom this plan thus far in its earnings results. According to its most recent earnings presentation, there is a line of sight to reducing costs by $1 billion and to become cash flow breakeven for 2018. This isn't the first time that Weatherford has promised significant cost cuts and to improve cash generation, though. So until it actually happens, it's better to be skeptical. Weatherford is the world's fourth-largest oil services company, with a large footprint in places that will likely start to see an uptick in drilling activity now that international oil benchmark prices are above $80 a barrel. That said, Weatherford isn't the only one fighting for those contracts, and its value proposition compared with other big players like Halliburtonand Schlumbergerjust doesn't seem worth the concerns about executing a turnaround and cleaning up the balance sheet.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/16/even-at-80-oil-you-should-avoid-these-3-stocks.aspx

We are very proud of our oil industry and our contribution to national security, said Dave Noerr, the mayor of Taft, a city of 9,400 in the southwest foothills. Were just a bunch of hard-working, America-loving good ol' boys. Story continues below advertisement Yet in a distinctly blue state that has pledged to slash greenhouse gas emissions within a decade, drilling seems on borrowed time even in this red county. Locals are watching legislators in Sacramento push bills to meet Californias climate goals, while in Washington the Biden administrations focus is on helping communities dependent on fossil fuel revenue transition to renewable energy Advertisement Such moves make county officials latest action all the more remarkable. The Board of Supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance in March thats likely to significantly accelerate drilling  with as many as 40,000 new oil and gas wells in Kern by mid-2030. Its language, crafted in consultation with the industry, includes a blanket environmental impact statement that will make it easier for companies to get drilling permits. We all realize change is inevitable. New technology, new innovations will eventually change the way we produce and consume energy in the future, Chairman Phillip Peters, whose family has deep roots in oil, said just before the vote. But while we are looking at that, I dont think we can ignore the present. The world still runs on Kern oil. Story continues below advertisement The outcome, following a nine-hour hearing that was one of the longest in board history, is a window on the stakes involved as communities and states try to shift away from fossil fuels to slow climate change. In Kern, it raises land-use and groundwater issues, further pitting the oil and gas industry against the equally important agricultural sector. For the regions large Hispanic community  families who live or work near the open wells  it puts their health even more in the crosshairs. The reality is that were so afraid, Estela Escoto said Tuesday through a interpreter. Everything that the oil industry and the gas industry have dumped into our communities are only bad things. On a hot afternoon, residents can barely see the Sierra Nevada mountains that border the valley to the east because of the dense pollution. Drilled wells release greenhouse gas emissions that are major contributors to climate change and respiratory problems. The closer the proximity to the source, studies show the higher the risk. In 2020, Kern was ranked the worst U.S. county for year-round particle pollution in the American Lung Associations annual report A high proportion of Kerns disadvantaged community lives near emissions sources such as extraction, distribution and refining sites, according to state data. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement When Escoto and her husband moved from Los Angeles to the small city of Arvin, which sits southeast of Bakersfield, it was to buy their dream retirement home. But it didnt take long before both were dealing with extreme year-round allergies. Escotos throat would get so itchy that she dreamed of shoving her hand down it to scratch. We went to the doctor and he told us, You live in Arvin? Well then, I recommend that you move, because its one of the most polluted communities, Escoto recalled. At first we laughed, then we got mad. She now heads the Committee for a Better Arvin, a local environmental justice group that was among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit fighting the original environmental impact assessment needed for proposed wells. The outcome forced the county to require greater pollution mitigation by companies. Some of the same plaintiffs are now challenging the supervisors latest vote, which they believe was motivated by the tax dollars and jobs that new wells represent. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement We feel neglected. We feel that they are not taking us seriously, Escoto said of the board, which she says ignored a request to provide meeting materials about the ordinance in Spanish. And they decided to come and put an ordinance that would allow thousands of oil wells in a span of 15 years.  It completely sets aside our suffering, our struggles. The fossil fuel industry has strong ties to Kern. Towns bear the names Oildale and Oil City. The American Petroleum Institute adopts its highways. A programthat lets local high school students take math, science or engineering classes free at California State University Bakersfield is funded by and named after Chevron. The oil and gas industry also pays upward of $197 million in yearly property taxes, money that helps pay for teachers, police officers and firefighters. That isnt lost on residents. People dont fully understand, not just the contributions that come from oil and gas, but the need for it, Noerr said, especially in the state of California. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement The county has more than 47,000 active wells and more than 25,000 idle wells, according to data from the California Geologic Energy Management Division. Theyre readily visible from roadways. Many are only hundreds of feet from homes, schools and farms. Farmers worry about whats to come and how their land  which produces a bounty of almonds, grapes and pistachios  will be affected in the long term. They note their importance to the county, with agriculture a vital economic force in Kern. Nearly 6 percent of jobs are in the extraction or construction industries, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Farming, fishing and forestry jobs constitute 13 percent. My immediate concern is how they treat our surface, how much acreage they take out of farming, said almond farmer Keith Gardiner, who owns and operates more than 20,000 acres in addition to a farm management company in Kern. He contends that he has lost millions in revenue because of groundwater contamination over the years. The areas oil and farm industries have always run parallel to one another, but tensions have been escalating. Kern County is one of the few parts of California to allow hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in which water, sand and chemicals are injected into the bedrock under high pressure to facilitate the extraction of petroleum or natural gas. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Early on, there wasnt much drilling in our prime farmland areas. It was always on the fringes, Gardiner recalled. But as those reserves were tapped and as fracking became really widespread, they figured out how to frack this shale  Then there started to be more controversy. He and other farmers fear more wells will mean a higher likelihood of salinated water leaching into clean groundwater. Theres also concern that uncapped idle or orphaned wells, for which no one takes legal or financial responsibility, will only increase in number.

NEW YORK  The fate of the Dakota Access pipeline could be decided at a U.S. court hearing Friday, where federal regulators could set in motion a months-long shutdown of the line while the Biden Administration completes an environmental review. Source: Reuters The market has been increasingly worried about a possible shutdown as the White House aims to reduce the nations reliance on fossil fuels and address concerns of minority communities harmed by carbon emissions. Bidens administration has restricted oil-and-gas leasing on federal lands and cancelled permits for the proposed Canada-to-U.S. Keystone XL line and a U.S. Virgin Islands refinery expansion. Energy Transfers Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) ships up to 570,000 barrels of North Dakotas crude production to the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast. It has been in danger of shutting down since a D.C. court threw out a key permit last summer that allowed it to operate under a water source used by Native American tribes. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is in charge of issuing permits for pipelines to travel under waterways, is expected to detail plans for DAPL at the hearing before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. That court canceled the lines permit in July and ordered it to undergo a more thorough environmental review. The Corps has allowed DAPL to operate since as it assessed its options and brought the Biden administration up to speed. It is more likely than not that the pipeline gets shut down, at least temporarily, said Glenn Schwartz, analyst at energy consultancy Rapidan Energy Group, which put the odds at a temporary shutdown at 70%. The line has been in operation since 2017, when incoming President Donald Trump fast-tracked the permitting process and allowed the line to enter service despite opposition from environmental groups and Native American tribes. Trump lost his bid for re-election in November to Biden. Environmental groups and Native American tribes say the pipeline threatens a drinking water supply and should not continue to run, and they have ramped up pressure on the White House to shut the line. Since its permit to cross under Lake Oahe was thrown out, DAPL has been legally trespassing on federal land, and the Army Corps must now decide if the line should continue running. A district court could order the line shut if the Army Corps chooses not to pursue a closure. If the line were to be shut, oil shippers out of the Bakken region in North Dakota and eastern Montana would have to rely on existing smaller pipelines and shipping by rail. U.S. crude markets would be shaken up by the shutdown of the primary link from the Bakken to Midwest and Gulf Coast markets, wrote analysts at BTU Analytics.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/fate-of-dakota-access-pipeline-at-stake-at-friday-court-hearing/

Oil & Gas Russian oil producers struggle to contain gas flaring Climate change poses a series challenge for Russia, with the economy heavily reliant on oil and gas production, as well as mining, and the government is under pressure to cut emissions Reuters April 10, 2021, 08:13 IST MOSCOW: Russian oil producers reduced gasflaring only slightly last year and failed to reach a targeted level by a large margin, hampered by a lack of necessary infrastructure at new oilfields, a draft government document seen by Reuters showed on Friday. Flaring, or the combustion of gas generated by various processes in the oil industry, generates carbon dioxide emissions. Climate change poses a series challenge for Russia, with the economy heavily reliant on oil and gas production, as well as mining, and the government is under pressure to cut emissions. The draft document, outlining oil industry developments until 2035, showed that the utilisation of the associated petroleum gas (APG) oil companies produce as a byproduct of crude extraction, rose to 82.6 per cent in 2020 from 81.5 per cent in the previous year - well below the 95 per cent target which was expected to be achieved in the mid-2010s. The document cites lack of infrastructure needed to transport and utilise APG, as well as a number of incidents at refining facilities as the main reasons for the high level of gas flaring. The rate of APG utilisation in Russia rose to 88.2 per cent in 2015 from 76.2 per cent in 2013 but has declined since then, according to the document. The World Bankfound Russia, Iraq the United States and Iranaccounted for 45 per cent of all global gas flaring in 2017-2019. Gas flaring rates dipped across most of the top 30 gas flaring countries in early 2020 due to the pandemic. The Russian document shows Surgutneftegazhad the most success in containing gas flaring, with its APG utilsation rate rising to 99.5 per cent last year. At Russian gas giant Gazprom , it stood at 98.9 per cent, but was just 73.1 per cent at energy major Rosneft. Russian APG utilisation rose to 94.7 billion cubic metres (bcm) overall in 2020 from 94.1 bcm in 2019. The rest was flared into the atmosphere.

View Comments President Joe Bidens attempts to mitigate climate change continued to see mixed reviews from New Mexico leaders as the President sought to reduce pollution by slowing fossil fuel production  a major driver of the states economy. Four months into his presidency, Biden unveiled a $2 trillion infrastructure package known as the American Jobs Plan which prioritized the U.S. transition to clean or renewable energy sources like wind and solar while also seeking to invest in rural communities such as those in southeast New Mexico which could be hit hardest by a shift away from oil and gas. More than half of New Mexicos oil and gas production occurs on federal lands subject to Bidens regulations, while about a third of the states budget is funded by revenue from that industry. More: 'It doesn't feel like home anymore."" Locals fight oil and gas' impact on Carlsbad area Throughout the plan, it repeatedly mentioned the need for clean electricity in most industries as the administration sought to modernize the nations infrastructure and power grids and create jobs while reducing carbon emissions and Americas impact on pollution and climate change. The plan also included $16 billion to plug abandoned oil and gas wells and mines, a problem facing New Mexico regulators following a downturn in oil and gas production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently slumping fuel demands. The States main oil and gas regulatory agency the Oil Conservation Division reported in March that it plugged 42 orphaned wells at a cost of about $1.6 million in the last fiscal year and aims to plug about 50 each year. More: New Mexico spent millions plugging abandoned oil and gas wells in 2020 OCD records show the State is aware of 121 orphaned wells on State land, 298 on private land and 293 on federal land in New Mexico. Operators take out bonds when wells are drilled to pay for such remediation, but the funding is often inadequate, said OCD Director Adrienne Sandoval and the state must step in at taxpayer expense. U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) said plugging the wells was essential to his states public health and environment, and that the federal government should support the work using the federal funds in Bidens plan. More: Local New Mexico leaders defend oil and gas industry amid federal leasing review He said nationwide, there are more than 60,000 abandoned oil and gas wells and more than 700 in New Mexico alone and plugging the wells could create jobs lost during the recent oil and gas bust. They pose serious environmental risks and threaten communities across the country, Heinrich said. This is a problem we must solve. President Bidens American Jobs Plan does exactly that. With strong funding for states and Tribes to address the current backlog of these orphan wells, we can put people to work plugging them, protecting groundwater, and curbing hazardous emissions. U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM) also voiced support of Bidens plan and its funding for abandoned wells, arguing it could be a key part of New Mexicos recovery from the pandemic supported by the federal government. More: New Mexico breaks oil and gas production records in 2020 as COVID-19 challenges growth Lujan said he planned to introduce legislation in the Senate to create even more funding to plug the wells and remediate the land. The public health and economic crisis has hit New Mexicans hard, and Im working toward finding solutions to create new, good-paying jobs and boost local economies, he said. Plugging orphaned oil and gas wells is one common-sense solution to put New Mexicans back to work while also safeguarding our communities from harmful air pollution. Cleaning up orphaned oil and gas wells has been a longtime priority of mine, and Ill be introducing bipartisan legislation in the Senate to make this a reality. More: 'Community solar' becomes law in New Mexico, to help shift away from oil and gas But Republicans and oil and gas industry group in New Mexico continued to voice criticism of Bidens unfolding energy policy, worrying the Presidents emphasis on renewables could lead to economic ruin for a state deeply reliant on fossil fuels. Larry Behrens, Santa Fe-based western state director of Power the Future, an organization that says it advocates for energy workers, said Bidens plan amounted to a forced transition to renewables by raising taxes in an effort to satisfy the eco-left. He was critical of $174 billion in incentives for electric vehicles and charging stations included in Bidens plan, along with $100 billion to update the power grid using renewables and another $46 billion for the federal government to purchase non-carbon vehicles. More: New Mexico enacts tougher emissions rules on oil and gas, calls for 98 percent gas capture Behrens said less than 1 percent of the plan would go to helping oil and gas workers who could lose their jobs due to the Presidents energy policies. New Mexico has ranked among the worst in the nation for unemployment for months and apparently President Biden feels thats the perfect time to raise taxes in order to satisfy radical environmentalists, Behrens said. Any New Mexican who has lost their job will take cold comfort in the fact supporters of this proposal will have plenty of tax dollars to help fuel their electric vehicles while the rest of us pay more. Power the Future called on the State of New Mexico to join 14 states and their Republican leaders in suing the Biden administration over an ongoing halt on new federal oil and gas leases imposed upon Bidens inauguration. More: New Mexico Indigenous leaders criticize oil and gas industry amid Interior's federal review New Mexico could have the most to lose from this policy, Behrens said. He said New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas must act as the state continued to lose oil and gas rigs and other operations to neighboring Texas where most oil and gas production occurs on private land companies are not subjected to Bidens policies. Leaders in fourteen other states are standing up for their energy industry and its pathetic to see New Mexicos Attorney General sit on the sidelines, Behrens said. Hector Balderas was more than happy to sue the previous administration when his eco-left supporters demanded it. Now that New Mexico is losing rigs to Texas, Balderas is silent.

NEW YORK   Demand for feedstocks from renewable fuel producers is expected to surge in the United States in coming years as companies scramble to expand output. Source: Reuters Energy from material that comes from plants and animals, or biomass, currently accounts for roughly 5% of U.S. energy use, slightly more than wind and solar energy. Most U.S. energy use is still based around fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas. The United States and other nations are attempting to reduce overall carbon emissions and cut use of high-polluting fossil fuels. Refiners, farmers and agricultural giants are hoping to gain a foothold in fuel supply through production of fuels made from biomass. But biomass-based fuel production could face limits, as farmers need to harvest more soy and other products to meet growing demand, while companies that collect and process animal fats or spent cooking oil also would need to expand. Fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel draw from the same feedstock pool, and analysts have warned there might not be enough lower-carbon intensive feedstock to keep up. GRAPHIC: Petroleum was the most used energy source in 2020 Demand for soybean oil alone is expected to far outstrip supply by 2023, according to a BMO Capital Markets report from October 2020. The financial services provider estimates an incremental demand of 8 billion pounds of soybean oil by 2023 because of an increase in renewable diesel production. The feedstock issue is going to be an enormous problem. Dealing with this matter is going to be hard, said Robert Campbell, head of oil products research at Energy Aspects. Renewable energy made up 9.11 quadrillion British thermal units, or 9.8%, of the total energy consumption in 2020, according to Energy Information Administrations Annual Energy Outlook. By 2024, thats expected to grow to 12.23 quadrillion Btu, or 12.5%, of total energy consumption. RENEWABLE PRODUCTION ON THE RISE Biomass can make fuels such as renewable diesel, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel and ethanol. Renewable diesel production capacity is expected to nearly quintuple to about 2.65 billion gallons (63 million barrels) by 2024, investment bank Goldman Sachs said in October. But that would require an additional 17 billion pounds of feedstock, creating friction between existing biodiesel and food customers, the report said. The United States produced 533 million gallons of renewable diesel in 2020, according to a Reuters analysis of Environmental Protection Agency data. U.S. biodiesel production is roughly 110,000 barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administrations Annual Energy Outlook, dwarfed by oil refineries, which last year had an operable crude distillation capacity of around 19 million barrels per day, according to EIA. GRAPHIC: Feedstock used to produce biofuels While biodiesel requires around 7.5 pounds of feedstock per gallon, renewable diesel needs about 8.5 pounds per gallon, Goldman Sachs said. They estimate a 13-billion pound feedstock deficit by 2024 as more processing capacity starts up. Sustainable aviation fuel production will further increase demand for renewable feedstock. Though other, lower-carbon intensive feedstocks like tallow and used cooking oil are gaining traction because of government incentives, producers still rely mostly on corn and soybeal oil to make biofuels.

The combined oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose two to 432 in the week to April 9, its highest since April 2020, Baker Hughessaid in its closely followed weekly report. That puts the rig count up 77% since falling to a record low of 244 in August 2020, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1940. The total count, however, is still 170 rigs, or 28%, below this time last year. U.S. oil rigs were steady at 337 this week, while gas rigs rose two to 93, both near one-year highs. In April 2020, after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, drillers slashed a total of 263 rigs, as travel restrictions crashed oil demand and prices. Analysts at Goldman Sachsforecast the total U.S. rig count would rise to an average of 480-500 rigs by the fourth quarter of 2021 with most of that increase coming from the Permian in Texas and New Mexico (35-45 rigs), Eagle Ford in Texas (5-10 rigs) and Bakken in North Dakota (3-5 rigs). ""We believe that the U.S. needs a total of about 500 active rigs to keep production flat,"" Goldman Sachs said. Energy research firm East Daley lifted its rig and production outlook for the Permian following a 22% rally in U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures during the first quarter. ""We project Permian drilling to grow by 70+ rigs by early 2022 to over 285 basin rigs, setting the stage for a new multi-year growth cycle in Permian oil and gas production if oil prices can hold recent gains,"" East Daley said. WTI prices, which have gained in four of the past five months, were down this week on worries about rising global production and weaker demand than before the coronavirus pandemic. After falling to a record low of 433 rigs on average in 2020, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1988, U.S. investment bank Piper Sandler's energy specialist SimmonsEnergy forecast the count would rise to 451 in 2021 and 558 in 2022.

Natural gas for November delivery has had a strong run recently, having breached $3.40 per MMBtu, though today it's down 3.17% to $3.42/MMBtu. Many investors prefer to invest in commodity ETFs rather than directly in futures, and the United States Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) , having started the week with a spike past $34.50, is now down to $33.46. The United States Natural Gas Fund (NYSE: UNG) is up on last week, though it has started the day down 2.35% at $22.07. The nature of oil and gas companies' businesses means that they may succeed or fail regardless of oil prices. This week's risers have all made gains well in excess of the oil price over the last few months. Genel Energy (LSE: GENL.L) Genel Energy has gained 25% to 778 pence over the last three months, as political and operational progress in Kurdistan has brought the prospects of large-scale oil production and export closer to a reality for the company, whose CEO is ex-BP boss Tony Hayward. Kurdistan's status as a semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq means that political problems are the main stumbling block to successful development. Afren (LSE: AFR.L) Afren shares have risen by 59% to 137 pence so far this year, and like Genel, it looks likely to benefit from Kurdistan's massive oil reserves. Afren is currently carrying out exploration drilling in the Ain Sifni PSC in Kurdistan. The company's previous well in this area encountered 460 meters of net pay and delivered more than 13,000 barrels per day under initial testing. Afren is also developing previous discoveries in Nigeria. Gulfport Energy (Nasdaq: GPOR) Gulfport Energy has gained 69% to $31.16 over the last three months, outperforming the United States Oil Fund ETF by 56%. The company is gaining confidence in its Utica Shale drilling program and has recently been upgraded by brokers Global Hunter Securities from ""accumulate"" to ""buy,"" with a target price of $43. Small oil and gas shares are always volatile, and this week's winners could be next week's losers.

Also affected would be the likes of Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) , generally regarded as the largest of the independent producers and an operator in both the unconventional domestic plays and a variety of international locations. The heightened domestic taxes would also take its toll on Chesapeake (NYSE: CHK) , the Oklahoma City-based independent producer that has played a major role in opening and developing such unconventional plays as the Barnett Shale of North Texas, the Haynesville Shale of Texas and Louisiana, and the Marcellus shale, which subsumes much of the Northeastern U.S. An Obama sampler Looking at the specifics of the proposed tax increases, the first thing I notice is that they don't really stem from new taxes at all, but from repeals or removals of existing deductions under which the companies have operated and calculated their economics for some time. And while there are eight such deduction removals, rather than turn this article into a comprehensive course in energy taxes, I'll simply provide a sample of the key proposals in the Obama administration's approach to heightened taxation for the sector: Perhaps the most important of the proposals is the removal of what's called the Section 199 allowable deduction of 3% of the net income obtained through the primary production of oil, natural gas, or products created primarily from the use of those hydrocarbons in a manufacturing process. Note that this rule doesn't affect manufacturing companies across the board. Rather, it singles out energy companies for obvious discrimination. Deductions of intangible drilling costs would also be repealed. These costs -- which include labor, fluids, and costs associated with rig time -- are immediately deductible because they present no salvage value, regardless of whether the well in question uncovers oil or gas. The Marginal Well Production credit would also be repealed. This credit is limited to smaller producers and to periods when crude prices are low. According to the Department of Energy, removing this credit would cost 140,000 barrels of oil and the loss of about $10.5 million each day. Similarly, the Enhanced Oil Recovery Credit would also be removed. Like the Marginal Well Credit, this credit kicks in only when oil prices are at low levels and is meant to maintain production during those periods. The Independent Petroleum Association of America has pointed out that the EOR credit has benefited the nation during times when low prices would make production of expensive oil uneconomical. Further -- and amazingly -- there would be no gain to the U.S. government from a repeal of this credit. The Foolish bottom line As indicated, these proposed deduction repeals are only samples of the range of treatment the administration is seeking. It's important to recognize that, in addition to the oil and gas producers named above, those damaged by the deleterious approach aimed solely at the operators and their shareholders also include the oilfield services contingent -- including Halliburton (NYSE: HAL)",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/10/03/the-fastest-way-to-stop-oil-and-gas-drilling-part.aspx

In Oklahoma, that investment comes from a vibrant and growing oil and natural gas industry. 0 Brook A. Simmons The impact of the states oil and natural gas industry on Oklahomas largest cities is well-documented and easy to spot. Skyscrapers in Oklahoma City and Tulsas prominence as the Oil Capital of the World have made the Sooner States largest metros the corporate headquarters for worldwide industry leaders. But in Oklahomas rural communities, the economic impact of Oklahomas oil and natural gas industry is just as pronounced, with historic oil and natural gas hubs like Woodward, Ardmore, Duncan and Bartlesville basking in the glory of increased energy exploration and feeling the pinch in downturns like we have weathered the past two years. Take, for example, the southern Oklahoma town of Lindsay. With just 2,500 residents, the daytime population of the Garvin County community that lies in the heart of the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province (SCOOP) expanded four times over in recent years due to an influx of workers to the more than 200 oil and natural gas related businesses in and around Lindsay. For residents in Lindsay, a flurry of oil and gas activity equals a financial boon. The city itself generated an extra $4 million through the sale of water, primarily to companies exploring for and producing oil and natural gas nearby. And sales tax receipts for the city increased by $100,000 per month as more workers from the oil field frequented local stores. With the number of drilling rigs working in Oklahoma hitting an all-time low of just nine in June and still below the 20 mark today, the activity that drove the Lindsay economy to new heights has been greatly diminished. In fiscal year 2019-2020, sales tax collections in the city equaled $3 million. However, so far in FY 2020-2021, those collections have dropped to $1.3 million as the fiscal year nears its close. Rural communities need economic investment to survive and thrive. In Oklahoma, that investment comes from a vibrant and growing oil and natural gas industry. Brook A.

US Drillers Add Gas Rigs, Hold Oil Rigs Steady This Week Scott DiSavino, Reuters Fri, 04/09/2021 - 12:19 PM Your browser does not support the audio element. U.S. energy firms added two natural gas rigs and kept the number of oil rigs unchanged this week, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co. said April 9, with analysts forecasting more rigs were needed to keep production steady. The combined oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose two to 432 in the week to April 9, its highest since April 2020, Baker Hughes said in its weekly report. That puts the rig count up 77% since falling to a record low of 244 in August 2020, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1940. The total count, however, is still 170 rigs, or 28%, below this time last year. U.S. oil rigs were steady at 337 this week, while gas rigs rose two to 93, both near one-year highs. In April 2020, after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, drillers slashed a total of 263 rigs as travel restrictions crashed oil demand and prices. Analysts at Goldman Sachs forecast the total U.S. rig count would rise to an average of 480 to 500 rigs by fourth-quarter 2021 with most of that increase coming from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico (35 to 45 rigs), Eagle Ford in Texas (five to 10 rigs) and Bakken in North Dakota (three to five rigs). We believe that the U.S. needs a total of about 500 active rigs to keep production flat, Goldman Sachs said. Energy research firm East Daley lifted its rig and production outlook for the Permian following a 22% rally in U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures during the first quarter. We project Permian drilling to grow by 70+ rigs by early 2022 to over 285 basin rigs, setting the stage for a new multi-year growth cycle in Permian oil and gas production if oil prices can hold recent gains, East Daley said. WTI prices, which have gained in four of the past five months, were down this week on worries about rising global production and weaker demand than before the coronavirus pandemic. After falling to a record low of 433 rigs on average in 2020, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1988, U.S. investment bank Piper Sandlers energy specialist Simmons Energy forecast the count would rise to 451 in 2021 and 558 in 2022. That is the same as Simmons forecast since late March.

769,Could This Bane Become a Boom for Oil and Gas?,fool,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 16:21:00,"The harmful practice of flaring will have to come to an end, which poses opportunities for certain Bakken operators. shale gas revolution ,"" you might think that natural gas is a precious commodity. It might then surprise you to learn that when natural gas is produced as a byproduct from oil wells, developers often burn it off in a practice called ""flaring."" Flaring is stupid from almost every perspective, and yet it persists at alarming levels. Investor pressure and potential environmental regulation are likely to force a reduction in flaring, which would have a real impact on companies operating in the oil and gas sector. Gas: no longer just a crude joke Flaring is problematic for two reasons. First, it emits damaging greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and compromises regional air quality. Second, it wastes a valuable resource at a time when the world has a seemingly insatiable appetite for energy. It's sort of like incinerating money, and investors should have a problem with that. The scale of the waste is considerable. Based on EPA estimates, the industry lost more than $1 billion in profits in 2009 due to venting (release of natural gas without combustion), flaring, and accidental leaks called "" fugitive emissions ."" The U.S. Government Accountability Office, with supporting data from EPA, estimates that roughly 40% of natural gas that's vented and flared on onshore federal leases could be captured economically with currently available control technologies. There is currently a glut of flaring taking place in the Bakken formation, a prolific oil and natural gas liquids source underlying parts of North Dakota, Montana, and Saskatchewan. According to a December briefing from the North Dakota Industrial Commission: ""[The] high liquids content makes gathering and processing of Bakken gas economic. Additions to gathering and processing capacity are helping but the percentage of gas flared did not change at 30%."" To put this in context, Bakken flaring burns off enough energy each day to heat half a million homes. Pressures on the sector Why would this be? One reason is that producers want to keep wells active without extracting at a meaningful level because of currently low natural gas prices. Industry players say that a bigger reason is inadequate takeaway capacity, the infrastructure necessary to transport natural gas from where it's produced to where it's used. However, a July 2012 study from Bentek Energyfor North Dakota policy makers found current takeaway capacity exceeds production. The study found the real reason for the Bakken's high flaring levels to be the insufficient gathering pipeline infrastructure and gas processing capacity required to process wellhead gas and prepare it for shipping. Whatever the case may be, there is a void to fill. Even if takeaway capacity is currently sufficient, significant development in gathering and processing infrastructure will lead to greater outflows of natural gas, which sooner or later will exceed takeaway capacity. Thus, if there is to be a reduction in flaring, it will yield serious opportunities for midstream operators, and they know it. Enbridge Energy Partners NYSE:EEP ) expects to complete work on its Bakken Access Program early this year. The aim of the program is to expand the gathering capacity on its North Dakota system by 100,000 barrels per day . While the program is currently aimed at crude oil gathering, the company is well positioned through its expertise and presence to manage similar demand for natural gas infrastructure. Alliance Pipeline, of which Enbridge owns 50%, expects to complete its Tioga pipeline delivering natural gas from the Bakken Shale formation to the Chicago market by mid-2013 . ONEOK Partners NYSE:OKS ) completed its Garden Creek plant, a 100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility serving Bakken producers in January 2012. ONEOK plans to invest approximately $1.5 billion-$1.8 billion for growth projects in the Bakken Shale between now and 2014 in its natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids (NGL) businesses. Plains All American NYSE:PAA ) has been transporting NGLs by rail for around 25 years, and has a significant presence in the Bakken formation that it continues to expand both organically and through acquisitions. Plains is well-positioned to benefit from increasing natural gas production in the Bakken. My only concern is that rail transport presents a significantly greater risk of spills than moving NGLs by pipeline. A U.S. railway is about 34 times more likely to spill hazardous materials than a pipeline transporting the same volume an identical distance. Interestingly, Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE: ETP) may appear to be betting against this trend in its plans to convert its Trunkline system  which provides access to the Bakken play, among others  from natural gas to crude by April 2014. The move is a response to a bottleneck in crude takeaway capacity from the Bakken. In regulatory filings, ETP said the converted pipeline would still be able to carry natural gas, so perhaps this is the perfect hedge against whatever the future holds. Burning question But will there be a reduction in flaring? My guess is yes. The oil and gas sector is feeling the heat from two quarters: regulators and activist investors. The EPA has recently tightened regulations on a type of flaring that takes place during natural gas fracking. While this type of flaring only accounts for a small fraction of Bakken flaring, the issue is clearly on the regulatory radar. Meleah Geertsma, staff attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council told me that her group expects EPA to look into area-specific flaring issues in the future. Peter Zalzal, staff attorney at Environmental Defense Fund says that his group is working with the EPA to close gaps in existing standards. Meanwhile, a group of investors representing $500 billion in assets in March 2012 to 21 of the industry's largest shale oil producers urging them to reduce or eliminate flaring. Such shareholder pressure is on the rise, and I believe it will become increasingly difficult for companies to ignore.

770,Why These 2 Oil and Gas MLPs Need to Be on Your Radar,fool,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 14:46:00,"Upstream MLPs are a great way for regular investors to profit from America's energy boom. This article highlights 2 exceptionally well run oil and gas MLPs that are poised for mega-growth and likely to make income investors very rich. 17.44% Sources: S&P Capital IQ, Yahoo Finance, MLPdata.com Memorial Production Partners seems perfect in every way: high yield, strong distribution growth, undervalued, and a projected total return to make you drool. However, the coverage ratio being under 1 is a cause for concern, right? Not really, and here's why. Since its IPO in December 2011, Memorial Production Partners has successfully executed 12 accretive acquisitions. In the process it's grown its reserves, production, and adjusted EBITDA by 69%, 73%, and 101% CAGR, respectively. Memorial Production Partners has a total reserve of 1.574 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent, 61% of that in higher-margin liquids. With 1,836 net wells and 20 years' worth of production at current rates, Memorial Production Partners represents one of the best ways to play the prolific Permian, Eagle Ford, and Barnett shales. However, what really excites me about Memorial Production Partners and why I am not worried about its recent lack of distribution coverage, is the $1.1 billion in acquisitions completed thus far in 2014: 15.4 billion cubic feet of gas reserves in east Texas for $34 million. 7.4 million barrels of oil reserves in the Eagle Ford shale for $173 million. 83 million barrels of CO2 injected oil in Wyoming for $935 million. What is most exciting about this last purchase, is that it's all high-margin liquid, 75% oil, 25% natural gas liquids. In addition the production decline rate, thanks to the CO2 injection maintaining well pressure, is just 5% annually. Shale oil is notorious for catastrophic decline rates as high as 90% a year and this field has 39 years of production remaining. Thanks to these acquisitions Memorial Production Partners is guiding for a 2014 distribution coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.2, high enough to not only guarantee the generous yield but to ensure growth in the decade to come. Atlas Resource Partners: the king of high-quality yield Atlas Resource Partners has the distinction of being the highest-yielding quality MLP in the industry. It also sports one of the fastest growth rates with a stunning 614% increase in production in just the last two years, sending its distributions soaring by 45%, or 20.4% annually. What is the key to this stupendous success? Seven acquisitions worth $2 billion, but like Memorial Production Partners, Atlas Resource Partners is focusing on low-decline assets. In fact, Atlas Resource Partners' recent acquisitions have averaged an annual decline rate of just 8%. Back in February Atlas Resource Partners purchased 70 billion cubic feet of natural gas in West Virginia and Virginia for $107 million. These assets not only produce 22 million cubic feet/day of gas, worth $36.1 million annually at today's prices, but have a decline rate of just 11%. However, even that purchase pails in comparison to Atlas Resource's Rangely Field acquisition in which Atlas bought 47 million barrels of oil assets in Colorado with an nearly unheard of decline rate of just 3%-4% over the last 15 years. Atlas Resource plans on expanding CO2 injection into the field to preserve that decline rate and enjoy 2,900 barrels of oil/day over the 44 years production is expected to last. At today's oil prices this field will break even in just four years and produce $4.5 billion over its lifetime, paying for itself nearly 11 times over. Foolish takeaway When it comes to high-quality yield, few industries deliver like upstream MLPs, and few do it better than Memorial Production Partners and Atlas Resource Partners. These oil and gas producers provide long-term income investors with the trifecta of investing: high-yield, strong distribution growth, and shocking capital gain potential.

773,3 Stocks to Play Rising Global Oil and Gas Spending,fool,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 11:00:00,"Three companies that stand to benefit from this major trend sweeping the oil and gas industry. Jun 16, 2013 at 12:00PM Author Bio Arjun is a value-oriented investor focusing primarily on the oil and gas sector, with an emphasis on E&Ps and integrated majors. He also occasionally writes about the US housing market and Chinas economy. According to a recent report from Barclays, global exploration and production spending will reach a record $678 billion this year, representing a 10% increase over 2012 levels. The bank's forecast, an upward revision from its December 2012 estimate of $644 billion, would mark the fourth consecutive year of double-digit global spending increases since 2009. Much of the expected increase in global E&amp;P spending is attributed to new projects in the Middle East and other regions in Asia, Barclays added. North American spending, on the other hand, is forecast to grow by a relatively modest 2%. Barclays' assessment has important implications for one energy subsector: the services companies. Let's check out three of them that may be worth investing in. Halliburton In general, the rise in global E&P spending bodes well for the companies that provide the equipment and expertise necessary to exploit shale reserves. One company that's aptly positioned to profit is Halliburton ( NYSE:HAL ) , which, in addition to its dominant position in the U.S., also stands to benefit from the increase in E&P activity outside North America. In particular, the company's Drilling and Evaluation business, which provides field and reservoir modeling, drilling, evaluation, and precise well-bore placement solutions, stands out as a big potential winner from the increase in E&P spending that Barclays expects in the Middle East and other parts of Asia. Nuverra (formerly Heckmann) Next up is Nuverra Environmental Solutions ( NYSE:NESC ) , formerly known as Heckmann, a full-service provider of water management solutions. Over the next several years, the company stands to benefit from one major trend: the scarcity of water for fracking operations and the need to efficiently recycle and reuse it. What sets Nuverra apart from some of its competitors, such as Key Energy ( NYSE:KEG ) -- a fluid-treatment provider that focuses mainly on water disposal -- is its overarching focus on treating and recycling produced water, as opposed to just disposing it. For instance, it owns a stake in a wastewater recycling facility in the Marcellus and is working hard on improving its treatment and recycling capacity. And unlike many of its competitors, Nuverra offers its customers full-service solutions, helping them handle their water disposal and recycling needs throughout the full cycle, from delivery to disposal. National Oilwell Varco Another potential winner is National Oilwell Varco ( NYSE:NOV ) , the single largest supplier of rig equipment to the oil and gas industry. Through decades of smart acquisitions, it has grown to become the most dominant, low-cost provider of rig equipment for the world's largest drillers, commanding a whopping 60% market share. As CEO Pete Miller has noted, ""No well is drilled, nor any drilling rig exists, without some equipment on it from National Oilwell Varco."" While there are some short-term headwinds for the company, its longer-term prospects still appear robust. One of the key drivers of future growth should be the rig technology segment, especially its aftermarket services. Of the more than 150 rigs National Oilwell has delivered since 2005, very few have been returned to the company for major work. Once these rigs start coming back for surveys and other work, the company stands to earn $500 million to $1 billion in additional revenue, assuming $25 million to $50 million per major rig survey, which should continue to drive profitability for at least the next several years.

Colombo : Sri Lankaon Friday lodged a claim for $17.38 million with the Greek owners of an oil tankerthat caught fire and left a spill stretching 40 kilometres (25 miles) off the South Asian island. The New Diamond vessel was travelling from Kuwait to Indiawith 270,000 tonnes of crude oil on board in September when a fire broke out as it passed Sri Lanka's east coast. The crude being carried as cargo was unaffected by the blaze but some of the tanker's fuel leaked into the Indian Ocean. Its skipper was in October fined $65,000 for causing the spill and failing to inform local officialsof the environmental damage left behind. Authorities are now seeking compensation from Greek firm PortoEmporios Shipping Inc for the damage. ""The Attorney-General forwarded the marine pollution claim for 3,423 million rupees ($17.38 million) to lawyers of the owners of MT New Diamond in respect of the oil spill caused in September,"" the office of Sri Lanka's state prosecutor said in a statement. Officials said about 400 to 480 tonnes of fuel had leaked from the Panamanian-registered ship. Firefighters led by India's coastguard as well as the Indian and Sri Lankan navies succeeded in putting out the blaze before the vessel was towed to the United Arab Emirates Porto Emporios paid Sri Lanka $2.38 million for extinguishing the fire. The blaze started after an engine room boiler exploded, killing one crew member. The remaining crew of 22, including the skipper, were rescued.

781,Column: Ensuring the energy transition is equitable,oilandgas360,"Apr 09, 2021",2021-04-09 03:00:29,"The latest oil and gas news, dedicated to all things oil and gas: people, technologies, transactions, trends, and macro-economic analysis that impact commodity prices. LONDON   Phasing out consumption of fossil fuels in favour of zero-emission sources of energy will cause major social and economic disruption, creating a large number of losers as well as winners. Source: Reuters Policymakers have begun to focus on the need for a just or equitable transition to address some of these impacts and broaden political support for ambitious decarbonisation. Like any welfare-improving public policy, it should in theory be possible for the winners to compensate the losers through taxes, subsidies, transfer payments and other government programmes. In practice, government help to cope with the costs of industrial transition and adjustment has rarely been enough to offset the losses of the worst-affected groups. Structural economic changes caused by industrial transformation and changes in international trade have often created significant numbers of losers who have been hard to help through retraining and other policies. The zero-emissions energy transition is likely to have a similar impact. Providing transitional assistance to those individuals and communities hardest hit by the energy transition is likely to prove harder than policymakers anticipate and needs to be a major sustained focus. POTENTIAL LOSERS The largest group of potential losers will be low-income consumers in high-income and middle-income countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. They spend less on fuels and the energy-content of goods and services than richer fellow citizens, but it represents a higher share of their post-tax income. Lower income groups will be hardest hit by any increase in energy costs as a result of carbon pricing and upfront capital costs stemming from switching to decarbonised electricity-based systems for heating and transport. In principle, losses for lower income groups can be offset by changes to other taxes and government spending programmes. For that reason, carbon taxes may be preferable to other forms of carbon pricing because they create a revenue stream with which to compensate lower income consumers. The second group of losers, far fewer in number, will be those businesses and workers in energy-intensive industries such as iron and steel, chemicals and cement manufacturing. Most of their higher energy costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, but only if all manufacturers face a similar increase in the transition-related cost of energy. Harmonised international carbon prices and carbon border adjustments (tariffs) will be needed to create a level playing field and avoid the loss of enterprises and employment to other countries with low or no carbon prices. The third group of losers will be those businesses and workers directly involved in the production, refining and distribution of fossil fuels  initially mostly in coal, but later in oil and gas. Fossil fuel producers are the least numerous of the groups that will be hit by the energy transition but will suffer the greatest impact. The impact will be exacerbated because fossil fuel producers tend to be concentrated in particular communities, regions and countries. TRANSITIONAL CHALLENGES Structural change and the decline of coal and other heavy industries have created large pools of surplus labour and population in these areas, leading to unemployment, under-employment and depressed incomes. Broadly, government policies have focused either on moving people out of depressed areas to regions with stronger labour markets, or encouraging new businesses to move into the deprived areas. In practice, moving businesses and jobs has proved easier than moving people, given strong local community ties, so government policy has usually ended up trying to create new businesses in declining regions. Some policies have focused on retraining workers, others have focused on encouraging creation of new businesses through tax breaks, subsidies, investment programmes, infrastructure, and free trade zones. In the 1990s, China encouraged state-owned coal mining companies to create new non-coal businesses to employ workers no longer needed to mine coal, a strategy of regeneration through diversification within existing firms. In Spain, Britain and other countries, miners were encouraged to retire early on more generous benefits or claim disability, to soften the impact of mine closures, but that failed to create viable long-term regional economies. Multiple tax breaks, subsidies and special training problems have been employed to drive regeneration but success has been limited. The United States has had trade adjustment assistance for workers and communities hit by trade liberalisation since the 1960s, but it has not softened political and public criticism about the loss of manufacturing jobs. For the last century, retraining workers and creating new businesses to employ them in the same region has consistently proved very much harder than policymakers expected. Policymakers are right to focus on the need to cushion the social and economic disruption from the energy transition for consumers, workers and businesses, but they must not underestimate the scale of challenge.

785,Rising Star Buy: ATP Oil & Gas,fool,"Apr 08, 2021",2021-04-08 23:00:00,"One energy stock with an asymmetric payout. and Callon Petroleum (NYSE: CPE) , ATP is an exploration and production (E&P) company, unlike them, ATP takes the ""E"" out of the equation. It does this by buying proven, yet undeveloped, offshore fields and bringing them into production. 2010 was supposed to be such a banner year for ATP that our own Toby Shute picked the company as the best stock for 2010 Life has a way of throwing wrenches in our expectations, though, and that wrench was BP's (NYSE: BP) Deepwater Horizon disaster. A moratorium was imposed, and a series of confusing new regulations were drafted. The moratorium was lifted in October but deepwater permits were still very difficult to come by ATP kept chugging along and finished the year intact. It monetized its ATP Titanadding $150 million of immediate liquidity. The firm then completed its second Telemark well increasing production and allowed an additional $100 million to be drawn from its asset-backed credit facility. So why do I like it? Why buy: It's cheap ... ATP is sitting on large proven reserves and everything is finally falling into place. Using the industry standard PV-10 for valuing proved and probable reserves, and assuming a value of $1 billion for ATP's in place infrastructure, you get a total value of $6.6 billion. Subtracting $2 billion for taxes on the PV-10 and ATP's debt of nearly $1.8 billion, you get an equity value of $2.8 billion. That's over three times the current equity value of $855 million, a huge margin of safety. ... has a strong and aligned management ... CEO T. Paul Bulmahn has run ATP since he founded it in 1991. As you would expect, he owns a sizeable 12% stake in the company. Bulmahn is no slouch of an owner -- he deftly pulled the company through the debt crisis of 2008 when ATP had a significant need for cash and he has a proven track record of increasing reserves. ... with catalysts! There are three catalysts which excite me even more: 1. This year, ATP should be able to drill four more wells in the Gulf (two at Telemark and two at Gomez). The increased production should lead the market to revalue the company over time. 2. There has been increased M&A activityin the oil and gas space as the majors have been selling off lesser fields to Energy XXI (Nasdaq: EXXI) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) , among others. This gives ATP the opportunity to potentially pick up new reserves on the cheap. Also, there is an increased likelihood of the company being acquired. ATP recently agreed to a new contract for Bulmahn, with a provision that grants him three times his salary and bonus if the company is acquired; he also gets three years of continued medical, dental, life and disability benefits for himself and eligible dependents. This should incentivize him to go along with a sale should an offer come along. 3. Next year ATP should complete the Octabuoy, which will allow it to begin drilling in and producing oil from its Cheviot field in the North Sea. The risks ATP has survived thus far but still has roughly $1.8 billion of debt, essentially double the firm's entire market cap. The key challenge in 2011 is navigation of the permit process, and the key risk is that the Telemark wells could experience production problems, requiring more the burning of more cash. Summary I see this stock as a binary outcome: It's either going to soar or crash. As it's already a binary outcome, I'm increasing the reward-risk ratio by buying two January 2013 $12.5 calls of ATP tomorrow. If the stock takes off, I'll do better than what an investor now would make -- if it goes to 0, both I and a stockholder will suffer. It's really the asymmetric payoff which makes this interesting.

The value of the deals in the first quarter compares with $600 million for the first quarter of 2020 but is less than the $27.8 billion in deals recorded for the fourth quarter of 2020.  The five biggest deals last quarter involved a private company, Enverus noted in its report. These included Pioneer Natural Resources $6.4-billion acquisition of privately owned DoublePoint and Energy Transfers takeover of Enable Midstream Partners for $7.2 billion. Norways Equinor also made a deal with a private company last quarterit sold oil-producing assets in the Bakken play to Grayson Mill Energy, a firm backed by private equity money.  In February alone, mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. oil and gas upstream space totaled 35, up 12.9 percent on January but down 25.53 percent on the 12-month average, figures from GlobalData showed.  According to a senior Enverus analyst, the uptrend will continue. Andrew Dittmar added that private companies are becoming more willing to buy now that oil companies stock prices are rising and they are looking to offload non-core assets.  The pandemic that shook the oil and gas industry last year unleashed a wave of consolidation deals as companies grappled with the new reality of demand destruction and a gloomy long-term outlook.  This led to some notable deals in the shale patch, including Chevrons acquisition of Noble Energy and ConocoPhillips takeover of Concho Resources, both completed last year.  According to analysts, these two deals marked the beginning of the M&A wave that is now expected to accelerate, with exploration and production companies with manageable debts and strong acreage positions tying up to benefit from each others strengths to emerge stronger from the current crisis with a higher appeal to disgruntled shareholders.

Real estate stocks saw some traction due to lower interest rates and after the Maharashtra government cut stamp duty. However, a fresh spike in COVID-19 cases dented the sector in March. Binod Modi, Head - Strategy at Reliance Securities highlighted that there has been a shift in preference of higher allocation towards sectors, which can potentially do better or has already started witnessing traction in business activities. ""Real Estate sector has been seeing a steady improvement for the last couple of months led by lower interest rate scenario, reduction in stamp duty in certain states and increased affordability among buyers. Similarly, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resultant disruptions across the chains have made people realize the importance of insurance products,"" said Modi. ""Governments strong focus towards building up strong infrastructure for gas pipelines and continued thrust towards CNG vehicles and green energy attracted investors interest in oil & gas space,"" he said. Nitin Shahi - Executive Director of FINDOC, is of the view that investment in insurance by FPIs increased after the limit in the insurance sector was hiked to 74 percent. Besides, favourable government policies, stimulus measures and interest rate differential also played important role in investment decisions by FPIs. Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research believes after Maharashtra government eased some tax on real estate, some of the quality realty stocks including Godrej Properties, Oberoi Realty saw some traction and institutional buying had been significant. Can this momentum sustain? With further improvement in the economy and COVID-19 coming under control, the Indian market is expected to witness sustained FPI inflows. ""Overall, Investment in India is likely to continue in the upcoming years & with privatisation of PSU going to happen this year, FPI investments are expected to surge or even surpass what we witnessed in FY21,"" said Shahi. There may be sectoral rotation which will depend on the earnings, government policies and other factors too. Teresa John - Economist (Institutional Equities) at Nirmal Bang pointed out that globally cyclical sectors are witnessing interest in anticipation of recovery. ""In India, policy support and fall in interest rates is expected to support the residential real estate sector and flows may sustain going forward as well. Oil & gas is being supported by the global upturn in commodities which may be relatively short-lived,"" John said. The Head of Strategy at Reliance Securities believes the insurance industry will see healthy traction in the ensuing period as the pandemic has made people realise the importance of insurance products. Garg of CapitalVia Global Research is not much bullish on the oil & gas pack and advises investors to stay cautious on this sector.

(WLNS)  Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders has invited the heads of three oil and gas companies to testify at a committee hearing on climate change next week. Those invitations were sent to BP America Chairman and President David Lawler, ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Darren Woods, and Chevron CEO and Chairman Michael Wirth. Sanders says Lawler has already denied the request, claiming that oil and gas executives dont want to answer hard questions. Chevron and ExxonMobil have not yet released statements about their own chairmens attendance. While climate change may seem like an unusual topic for a budget committee, Sen. Sanders views fighting climate change as one of the committees responsibilities since changes in weather patterns can lead to damaging and expensive natural disasters. The Biden Administration is also planning to invest billions in green energy jobs as part of its proposed infrastructure package. The request to testify is not binding, and Lawler is not the only executive to refuse such a request from Sen. Sanders since he took over the Budget Committee.

IANS April 08, 2021, 15:02 IST New Delhi: Fuel pricesin the country remained unchanged on Thursday with oil marketing companies continuing on the pause mode and keeping petroland diesel pricesstatic for the ninth consecutive day. Accordingly, pump price of petrol and diesel remained at previous days level of Rs 90.56 and Rs 80.87 a litre respectively in the capital. Petrol and diesel fell by 22 paise and 23 paise per litre respectively last week on Tuesday in the wake of global softening of oil prices OMC have decided to pause price revision as they want to watch the crude price movement that has now fallen to around $62.5 a barrel from remaining above this level in much of the last week. Across the country as well the petrol and diesel price remained static on Thursday but its retail levels varied depending on the level of local levies in respective states. In Mumbai petrol continues to be priced at Rs 96.98 a litre and diesel at Rs 87.96 a litre. Premium petrol, however, continues to remain over Rs 100 a litre in the city as is the case with several cities across the country. The OMCs went on price cut for the first time this year on two consecutive days -- March 24 and 25 after keeping oil prices steady for past 24 days. It again reduced the price on March 30. Thereafter, fuel prices have remained unchanged. Earlier, petrol and diesel prices increased 26 times in 2021 with the two auto fuels increasing by Rs 7.46 and Rs 7.60 per litre respectively so far this year. Officials in public sector oil companies said that retail prices may rise again if crude and product prices pick up but for now it will fall or remain static for a few more days. --IANS",https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/petrol-diesel-prices-remain-unchanged-on-thursday/81967929
795,Carlsbad locals seek to stop oil and gas' harm to environment,currentargus,"Apr 08, 2021",2021-04-08 08:44:00,"Local group Citizens Caring for the Future and national environmental organization Earthworks teamed up to document oil and gas pollution near Carlsbad. View Comments Kayley Shoup didnt recognize her hometown when she moved back to Carlsbad in 2018. Shoup quickly noticed how oil and gas facilities grew throughout the Cavern City and surrounding areas during her time away, she said brought an array of human health and environmental problems as oil and gas boomed in the Permian Basin. The prolific shale basin that stretches from southeast New Mexico to West Texas saw a dramatic upswing in fossil fuel extraction and development in about 2017  driven by the increasingly widespread use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. More: New Mexico spent millions plugging abandoned oil and gas wells in 2020 The technological advancements allowed drillers to access deeper and harder-to-reach underground shale rock deposits, breaking up the formations and extracting crude oil and natural gas. The boom meant a windfall of revenue and jobs to the southeast corner of New Mexico and to the states coffers. But to Shoup, the economic boon came at a troubling cost. More: Local New Mexico leaders defend oil and gas industry amid federal leasing review She said she noticed many people she grew up with, including her mother, suffered from rare forms of cancer and other ailments. Answers to Shoups questions were hard to come by, she said, as a regular person with nowhere to turn. Thats why she joined local grassroots organization Citizen Caring for the Future, a group of Carlsbad-area residents dedicated to talking about the environmental concerns brought on by oil and gas and telling the story of the industrys impacts beyond economic benefits. More: Impact of NM's oil and gas production on economy, families discussed in Artesia roundtable The group joined Earthworks Field Advocate Nathalie Eddy on a tour of oil and gas sites in southern Eddy County Wednesday, using forward-looking infrared cameras to observe potentially air-polluting emissions and create evidence to be used in complaints to state regulators. Traveling from site to site in the Carlsbad area and throughout the Permian, the group reported that it continued to see and document leaks of methane and volatile organic compounds from oil and gas storage tanks, pipelines and flare stacks. Many flare stacks, where excess natural gas is burned off, were seen malfunctioning without any combustion, meaning gas was could be released directly into the air the facilities often share with residential neighborhoods. More: 'Community solar' becomes law in New Mexico, to help shift away from oil and gas At some point, youve got to think it has to do with whats going on around us, Shoup said of the rash of cancer diagnoses she noticed when returning to her hometown. It was becoming too many. Upon joining the group in late 2020, Shoup said speaking out about oil and gas was often met with resentment from a local community that relies on the industry and saw it quickly baked into its culture. With the hostility in this town, Ive lost a lot of friends calling this stuff out, Shoup said. I think the cost is a bit too high when talk about regulations. People say oil and gas leaves if theres any added rules. More: New Mexico enacts tougher emissions rules on oil and gas, calls for 98 percent gas capture The group doesnt wish to shut down oil and gas all at once, Shoup said, but find a way to balance the extraction of fossil fuels and its benefits with the needs of the environment following years, she said, of putting economics ahead of public health. She pointed to the State of New Mexicos recently enacted methane waste rules by its Oil Conservation Division, which called for an end to venting and flaring while requiring operators capture 98 percent of produced gas by 2026 through retrofitting and expanding infrastructure. Oil and gas industry leaders collaborated with the state and other stakeholders to develop the new rules, and many oil and gas majors recently signaled targets to reduce carbon emissions. More: New Mexico breaks oil and gas production records in 2020 as COVID-19 challenges growth We can do it in a balanced way, Shoup said. I think responsible oil and gas production is important. New Mexico needs adequate funding to enact the rules. Oil and gas lead the economy, but it comes at the cost of the southeast and our health. It doesnt feel like home anymore. Eddy said shed traveled to the area multiple times including a trip in November 2019 and another the following March. The latest trip revealed more of the same, she said, as ambitious environmental policy has yet to translate to action on the ground. More: New Mexico Indigenous leaders criticize oil and gas industry amid Interior's federal review It just doesnt stop, Eddy said. Every time we come out here, we find something. Whats changing in the state for greater protections for the environment, were seeing some really great shifts but were not seeing the change in the field yet. We need to put people above polluters. Nick King, another member of the local group and preacher at the Carlsbad Menonite Church said conversations about oil and gas is often become political and ignore scientific evidence that the industry is damaging the environment. The New Mexico Environment Department found the areas around Carlsbad and Hobbs, in neighboring Lea County to the east, both had ground-level ozone areas in excess of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), with Carlsbad reporting 79 parts per billion of ozone (ppb) and Hobbs 71 ppb, compared to the 70 ppb national standard. More: Pioneer Natural Resources buys $6.4 billion Permian Basin assets as market recovers That meant New Mexico two main oil and gas areas also had some of the highest levels of ozone, a pollutant formed when sunlight interacts with ozone and known to cause respiratory disease such as asthma and cancer. Im also concerned about the misinformation and not taking science into account, King said. It seems this evidence is not considered. Its just political. Completely shutting down oil and gas is not my object but to do it safely and responsibly. I would like to see more objectivity. Not just a political divide. And with the state and federal governments recently signaled increased support for renewable energy such as wind and solar, King  himself owner of King Solar which installs residential panels  said the group is optimistic about a low carbon future for southeast New Mexico. I think solar has a good future. Its almost cheaper than natural gas, King said. Oil and gas has its place, but it will be diminishing and I hope it continues to do so for the good of the climate.

796,Study Shows Need for New Oil and Gas Leader Mindset |Rigzone,rigzone,"Apr 08, 2021",2021-04-08 08:14:01,"A recent study concludes that oil and gas leaders need to demonstrate a new mindset to help their organizations survive and thrive. environmental, social, and governmental (ESG) compliance (39% innovation and digitization (33%) 97% of leaders surveyed see the regulatory pendulum swinging more toward greater government intervention Two-thirds of leaders surveyed see the industrys progress on diversity and inclusion (D&I) as below expectations or poor. Countless CEOs and directors have told us that they are concerned whether they and their teams are prepared to meet the challenges of the next decade  to navigate the energy transition, to be best-in-class on ESG performance, to innovate and seize opportunities for growth, said Csorba. Csorba also pointed out that companies should use this period of recovering and stabilizing commodity prices to re-invest in leadership development programs, rigorous 360 assessment programs, and coaching. These leaders must also lean in on D&I initiatives, not only because it is the right thing to do but because it drives business performance, continued Csorba. The real competition in the industry in the next decade wont be for customers alone, but for leaders who can anticipate, meet any crisis, develop agile and inclusive workplace cultures, and build companies and industries that last. Csorba also offered Rigzone additional insights that he and Pruner gleaned from the survey, along with observations about broader changes underway across the energy industry landscape. Read on for his perspective. Rigzone: First off, have you observed a definitive shift in energy leaders thinking on oil and gas recruiting amid the dramatic changes that have occurred in the industry since early 2020? Les Csorba: Following the tumultuous events of 2020, energy leaders have become more strategic and forward-looking with intent and focus on both business planning and talent and leadership development. The game has shifted from a pure execution play to a strategic play where leaders are now asking the right questions: How do we pivot in this disruptive time? What investments do we make in the energy transition? What is our role in reducing emissions and methane intensity and capturing or sequestering carbon? What is our compelling narrative to investors to attract new investment and capital? How do we attract and retain the right people from both inside and outside the industry to help us thrive in these changing times? Energy leaders must develop and maintain this long-term view and strategic mindset, or what we call, ripple intelligence, which is like visualizing stones thrown into a pond and watching the ripples in the distance. Energy leaders need to keep their eye on the long-range ripples and use them as an early-warning alarm system of what may lie ahead. Finally, there has been a shift in board oversight where directors are holding management more accountable for both financial and ESG performance. For far too long, boards in the sector have been largely deferential to their CEOs especially with respect to strategic issues. More boards, perhaps because of a combination ofstronger shareholder-minded directors and pressure from Wall Street and activist investors, are beginning to lean in with more rigor. Rigzone: How have external factors such as shareholder involvement and Executive and Legislative branch changes in Washington, D.C., influenced energy leaders mindset? Csorba: Energy leaders no longer have a choice about learning the art of diplomacy. As one of most closely watched and regulated industries today, the energy leader  from engineer manager to asset manager to CEO and corporate director  must be prepared to engage like an ambassador with all stakeholders. Moreover, developing the skill of agility and contingency planning is even more critical in light of the increasingly challenging regulatory operating environment (e.g., stocking up on oil and gas leases, creating a compelling social license to operate, or exploring new revenue lines such as capturing carbon and sequestration). This new mindset must also include a new boldness and moral clarity in articulating how the oil and gas industry is evolving for the future. Rigzone: How might this change in mindset affect what oil and gas leaders expect from employees, and vice versa? Csorba: While oil and gas employees are being asked to do more with less in a more disciplined cost environment (and may need to display even more resiliency and agility), this may actually create the beneficial effect of stretch assignments, greater development opportunities, and more upside for next-generation leaders. Equally, senior energy leaders (CEOs, executives, and board members), will need to model a new humility to reshape corporate cultures and behavior that encourage and embrace dissent and diversity of thinking. Moreover, employees will expect, even demand, that their leaders model the change that is required in the years ahead and adopt the new skillset: think like an activist, relate like a diplomat, serve as an advocate for the business, and develop a new humility. Rigzone: Lets compare key leadership attributes traditionally associated with oil and gas execs with those that the analysis revealed. What are some longstanding attributes that will likely continue to serve leaders well, which attributes might they need to rely less on, and which attributes should they expect to develop to succeed going forward? Csorba: Having survived  even thrived  in a cyclical commodity business for decades, the energy leader is perhaps the most resilient and pioneering among all industries. Energy leaders, however, must understand that they are operating in a secular downturn, which requires not only greater resiliency but transformation and innovation. Generally speaking,energy leaders score relatively high on the execution side when it comes to developing and producing oil and gas. Looking ahead, there will be a much stronger focus on leaders who can develop transformational skills, which includes things like leveraging big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to further enhance operational efficiency and capital discipline. Moreover, just as many energy leaders have served as champions of safety for decades, they also will need to become champions of ESG performance. This cant be done as a check the box exercise, but rather to create real and long-lasting competitive advantage. Rigzone: Which findings from the analysis were most surprising? Csorba: Surprisingly, energy leaders, scored lower in almost every leadership accelerator category in our META (Mobilize, Execute and Transform with Agility) framework when compared to leaders across other industries. Additionally, despite innovations like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, energy leaders scored lower in execution and transformation than all the others. This tells us that energy leaders need to be even more innovative while remaining focused on capital discipline, namely, resisting the temptation to outspend cash flow as prices recover. Additionally, we saw opportunities for the energy sector to",https://www.rigzone.com/news/study_shows_need_for_new_oil_and_gas_leader_mindset-08-apr-2021-165085-article/

The measures were developed as part of consultation on the Offshore Oil and Gas Decommissioning Review in December and January, and include strengthening existing trailing liability provisions to enable government to call back a former titleholder in a broader range of circumstances, and increased oversight of changes in company control. Advertisement The measures were also aimed at increasing requirements for financial assurance, modernising field development plans and enhancing decomissioning plans, the earlier and proactive use of remedial directions powers if required, and improved transparency and public engagment on decomissionings. Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt said the measures will ensure the offshore decommissioning framework is clear and fit for purpose. Advertisement Australias offshore oil and gas industry has supported Australias energy security and economic activity for over 50 years and it will continue to be an important economic and energy security driver for the foreseeable future, Pitt said. The enhanced framework will make certain that there is effective regulatory oversight and robust financial and accountability safety nets for offshore oil and gas decommissioning requirements. It will strengthen protections for the environment, the industry, the Australian government and taxpayers. Pitt said that a mix of legislation and regulation changes will support the measures, starting with the release of an Exposure Draft of a Bill to improve Australias offshore oil and gas decommissioning regime. The Bill is open for comment until April 23. The Bill also gives effect to the relevant recommendations of the Walker Review. It expands existing trailing liability provisions, increases oversight of changes in titleholder ownership and control, and increases scrutiny on companies operating, or looking to operate, within the regime, said Pitt. The National Offshore Petroleum Administrators power to require this information is also being strengthened. The framework will be implemented using a staggered approach, with further consultation with industry and other stakeholders as each measure is developed. It is important to strike a balance between implementing regulatory safeguards for Australian taxpayers, managing the impost on industry while encouraging continued investment in oil and gas development, Pitt said.

801,"Gov. Abbott talks oil, gas and the future of energy",mysoutex,"Apr 08, 2021",2021-04-08 05:00:00,"During the Texas Oil &amp; Gas Association (TXOGA) annual Texas Energy Day 2021, several Texas leaders sat down with TXOGA President Todd Staples to explore the present and future impacts Save During the Texas Oil & Gas Association (TXOGA) annual Texas Energy Day 2021, several Texas leaders sat down with TXOGA President Todd Staples to explore the present and future impacts and benefits the oil and gas industry has on the state as well as the nation. Staples met with Governor Greg Abbott in his office at the state capito talk about how the oil and gas industry is changing and what that means for oilfield workers and the residents of Texas in the months and years ahead. Administration woes We know that there are now additional challenges coming from Washington DC, but know that Texas will be your partner in fighting against those challenges, to make sure that you are able to continue to play the prolific role that you have played, Gov. Abbott said. Its so important not just for the jobs and the economic impact that you provide, but its equally important for world and global dynamics, that Texas and the United States continue to lead the production so that we as a state and as a nation, remain energy independent. Abbott talked about his recent trip to East Texas where he spoke to residents from Midland or Odessa about President Joe Biden shutting down the XL Pipeline and the jobs that were lost or may be lost if Texas isnt able to explore and produce oil the way it has for decades. I understand that in the past few months the world has changed with regard to the energy sector in Texas, as well as across the United States, because of the new administration seeking to impose these Green New Deal policies, Abbott said. Green New Deal policies that threaten fossil fuel production in the state of Texas that we are accustomed to. Something else that we are accustomed to, is fighting back and protecting the fossil fuel industry in Texas. The governor stated that he filed 31 lawsuits under President Barrack Obamas administration against regulations in order to keep Texas on top as an oil and gas producer. He added that he wants anyone state agency that receives any type of new regulation that looks like Washington, DC may be attempting to impose regulations to contact his office so he can take legal action to shut it down. I just want you all to know that through those tools  as well as others  were going to be fighting every step of the way to make sure that you do have the ongoing ability to explore, to produce and to pipe fossil fuels here in the state of Texas  because its so important, not just for you and your businesses, but its so important for the future of the United States. Technological advances Staples said that he was talking a lot about oil companies, but they are not really only gas companies, they are innovation and technology companies because theyre making and developing solutions to produce cleaner fuels and since 1990, carbon dioxide emissions have dropped 23 percent. It is the equivalent of having removed 88 million vehicles from the roads in Texas, Abbott said. If you were doing the math, that would pretty much mean every vehicle has been removed. This shows something that the public doesnt want to talk about  certainly the press doesnt like to talk about it  and that is really how much Texas has improved with regard to this environment, with regard to emissions and things like that. LNG uptick Staples said, We hear the term energy transition a lot these days, and what you just described, makes me understand and know that transition means that the private sector is going to be transitioning to a lower emission future, lower carbon future, while still providing the resources that are important to power our lives. Abbott pointed out that because of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) being used more across the globe is the reason the environment has become cleaner. He visited India and Japan to talk to their leaders because they rely on LNG so much and he wants to maintain that relationship as best as possible. San Patricio County has one of the largest LNG suppliers with Cheniere, and more facilities are being built in Texas to meet the growing demand. But there is current legislation that is trying to stop residents in certain cities in Texas from using LNG to power and heat their homes, which Abbott has an issue with. So I have an official name for this proposed bill and it is called the Sanity Act, he said.  We need sanity. It is what some of these other states are doing. Certain locations in California, like San Francisco, where they are banning hookups for natural gas going into homes. Texas is not going to go down that pathway. But something that we all need to collectively come to grips with is the reality that in the state of Texas, there are a lot of different philosophical opinions. Theres one thought process that you see most people to the Permian Basin have. But I think you all know, theres a different mental process that some people in the city of Austin have. For example, in the past we saw the city of Denton pass a ban on fracking. So you all need to understand there are cities in the state of Texas that do pose threats . Were going stop that dead in its tracks by passing a bill to make sure that every customer in the state of Texas is going to have their own choice to choose natural gas or one of their supplies of energy, because its a cheap, clean use of energy. Growth With the mass exodus of multi-billion dollar companies like Tesla coming to Texas from places like California, Staples asked if Texas infrastructure was ready for such an influx of business. I feel very confident about it, Gov. Abbott said. The first one reason why we do have so many resources available for us to invest in roads is because of the oil and gas severance tax. Bruce Bugg is chairman of the Texas Department of Transportation Commission and has probably spent more time in the Permian Basin region than anybody else ever has  and probably more time there than any other region in the state of Texas. Hes very familiar with the needs in the energy sector, from the Permian Basin all the way to the ports and I feel very confident that we will be able to continue to build out roads as well as pipeline transportation. Winter storm Abbott said that freeze we went through in February posed challenges for residents lives, for safety and also for the oil and gas sector.

803,Hoeven believes key priorities for oil and gas can still be won despite Biden administration,willistonherald,"Apr 07, 2021",2021-04-07 23:21:00,"Among top priorities for Sen. John Hoeven right now is working behind the scenes to assure uninterrupted operation of the Dakota Access pipeline while a court-ordered Environmental Impact Statement is Save Among top priorities for Sen. John Hoeven right now is working behind the scenes to assure uninterrupted operation of the Dakota Access pipeline while a court-ordered Environmental Impact Statement is being prepared. Hoeven told a group of energy industry leaders on Wednesday that he worked with Chairman Mark Fox on getting a tribal consultation on the Dakota Access pipeline, and that he has also been talking with the Corps about the situation, as well as colleagues on the Energy Committee, such as Senator Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator from Virginia. The key is that we can keep the Corps  they want oil to continue to flow while they do their EIS. And if we can just keep them on track and operating the pipeline, and then completing that EIS within something less than a year now, thats a huge step, Hoeven said. Hoeven said the Three Affiliated Tribes have a strong case with the federal government when it comes to Dakota Access, with around 230,000 barrels of oil coming off their reservation and traveling in that pipeline. (The federal government) has a fiduciary duty to protect trust assets, Hoeven said. And they have a trust relationship with the tribe, so Im hoping thats helpful. Hoeven said the Corps and Energy Transfer are taking additional safety precautions for the pipeline to try to accommodate concerns from the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota, as well as tribes in South Dakota. This is something where we gotta work together, so it doesnt get to be just looked at in a partisan way, Hoeven said. Thats what we want to stay on. The Corps is on track to continue to have it operate and complete the EIS. Thats the key. And thats why were trying to keep i tin this framework, so neither the administration nor the courts, can come in and get it into more of a partisan fight. The Senator also sees avenues for certain important oil and gas priorities, despite the Biden administration, on key concepts, particularly, carbon capture, in which North Dakota is well-situated to lead the nation. Sen. Deb Haaland, as the former congresswoman of New Mexico, and now Secretary of the Interior, has a lot of federal land with interesting development potential. Hoeven hopes that could help keep doors open to at least some energy development on federal lands. I think that will help in that they want to see energy development as well, he said. So Im not saying its going to be easy or as smooth as we want it to be. But Im thinking well get back to it, I hope sooner, and not later. I think well still have challenges with permitting and that kind of stuff, but hopefully at least well be back to you know producing energy on the federal land by the end of this 60-day moratorium. Thats what were working toward. Other priorities Hoeven discussed include:  Securing approval for WBI Energys North Bakken Expansion Project from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  Pushing back on the Biden administrations executive actions targeting U.S. domestic energy production, including oil, gas and coal development on federal lands.  Ensuring the reliability of the electric grid by supporting the continued use of baseload power sources, like coal. This includes cracking the code on carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies. North Dakota built the right kind of legal, tax and regulatory environment needed to unleash innovation and realize the potential of the Bakken region, Hoeven said. This has led to a strong economy, created good-paying jobs and made America a global energy powerhouse. We need to build on this progress to ensure our continued economic and national security. Hoeven said the Biden administrations measures will put the nation at a competitive disadvantage and lock away taxpayer-owned energy resources. This has serious consequences for local economies, increases prices for consumers and reduces needed revenues to state, tribal and local governments, Hoeven said. Thats why we will continue our efforts to press back on duplicative federal rules and unilateral actions like these from the administration, and instead work in bipartisan fashion to advance new innovations, like CCUS, that empower us to produce more energy with better environmental stewardship.",https://www.willistonherald.com/news/oil_and_energy/hoeven-believes-key-priorities-for-oil-and-gas-can-still-be-won-despite-biden-administration/article_043681da-97f8-11eb-9553-8b46b582d1ee.html

807,The Oil Industry Receives An Unexpected Boost From Biden,oilprice,"Apr 07, 2021",2021-04-07 19:00:00,"President Biden has been accused of relentlessly attacking the oil sector, but it appears that the administration has been far friendlier to oil than many expected and his infrastructure investment will give the sector another big boost The election of President Joe Biden has been the cause of much hand-wringing in the United States oil and gas sector. The current U.S. president has made clean energy and climate change a central part of his platform, at what many fear will be the expense of shale, one of the nations key economic sectors. Unfortunately, our economic bedrock of oil and gas is under attack by an administration that is bent on eliminating millions of jobs, Republican Congressman Brian Babin told the public back in February at a press event along with six other Texan lawmakers, as he stood in front of the refineries and petrochemical plants of the Houston Ship Channel.  This rather alarmist missive came on the heels of the then very new presidents decision to pull the plug on the massive Keystone XL pipeline project on his very first day in office. Babins sentiments have been echoed by plenty of oilfield insiders and pro-oil pundits who have not been shy about decrying the new administrations less than cozy relationship with the shale sector.  That sentiment is understandable, with Bidens Energy Secretary pick Jennifer Granholm issuing an ultimatum to the oil industry to adapt or die. Granholm emphasized that the world is moving away from oil and toward clean energy. Im not going to sugarcoat how hard transitions are, Granholm said at IHS Markits annual CERAWeek conference last month, acknowledging that the clean energy transition will be anything but easy for the United States shale patch. The bottom line is this particular growth of clean energy and reduction of carbon provides a huge opportunity and Im extending a hand of partnership, she said.  Related Video How To Love Pipelines and Fear Climate Change    Despite this rhetoric, it seems that the Biden administration is now throwing the oil industry a bone. The presidents much-touted infrastructure initiative is going to call for asphalt - lots and lots of asphalt - in an unexpected boon for the domestic oil sector. Last week Biden presented his $2.25 trillion infrastructure proposal that will provide a number of economic opportunities for oil, including $115 billion allocated to roads and bridges, and an additional $16 billion to get out of work oilfield laborers back into paid positions plugging abandoned wells across the United States.  The biggest opportunity, however, lies in the sky-high asphalt demand embedded in the infrastructure spending bill. The biggest winners may not be in the domestic market though. Since asphalt is derived from the heaviest and most-dense material in a barrel of crude this development could stand to benefit Canadas struggling oil sands the most, which will be ecstatic for any new market for their heavy crude bitumen.  Related OPEC Was Wise To Ease Output Cuts Despite Demand Concerns  In fact, while the Biden administration is charging full steam ahead on the clean energy transition, with massive investments into electric vehicles and renewables, its clear that they have been listening to the oil sector and have been making a concerted effort not to leave oilfield workers behind. Since taking office two months ago, Bidens been more boon than bane for a fossil-fuel industry that was wary of the ascendance of a politician bent on accelerating the energy transition, Bloomberg reported last week, citing Goldman Sachs assertion that Biden has been bullish for oil overall.  The jobs cant come fast enough. Home to the worlds third-biggest oil workforce, the U.S. saw an 11% cut to headcount in 2020 that reduced the ranks of employed to just under 1 million, Bloomberg reports. Another 10,000 or so job cuts are expected this year. While the Biden administration has been straightforward that there will be oilfield industry casualties from the green energy transition, so far it does seem that theyre doing what they can to soften the blow. It appears that even the infrastructure investments into renewable energy will benefit oilfield workers in the end - and ultimately large oil states like Texas will play a major role in the future of wind, solar, and energy storage in the U.S.  By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-Oil-Industry-Receives-An-Unexpected-Boost-From-Biden.html

Thank you for signing up to our newsletter. Something went wrong - please try again later. Sign Up Nigeria has revoked four licences held by Addax Petroleum and handed them to the operators former contractor. Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) head Sarki Auwalu disclosed the move during a roundtable with the Nigerian media. The agency cited This Day as reporting the development. Chinese-owned Addax lost OML 123, 124, 126 and 137 because it failed to carry out work on the licences, Auwalu said. The company had refused to develop the assets, he said. This failure is economic sabotage, the director said, pointing to grounds under the Petroleum Act laid out for revocation of a licence. The DPR awarded the blocks to Kaztec Engineering and Salvic Petroleum Resources, the report said. The agency will provide an official handover for the assets. Addax knew the potential of the asset, but [it] refused to develop it. This state of underdevelopment is against the principle of the Petroleum Act and constitutes revenue loss to the government, This Day reported Auwalu as saying. There is a substantial gas resource at OML 137, said the director, but Addax failed to develop this asset in line with the governments gas revolution policy. As such, it was necessary to take a step to attract willing and capable investors to under the development of the assets both for our domestic use and exports. Addaxs production has been declining over the years because of its failure to invest, he continued. The company has also continued flaring. The company failed to supply gas for local consumption despite a domestic supply obligation, he said. Chrome Sir Emeka Offor owns Kaztec Engineering, via his Chrome Group. Addax awarded work to Kaztec over the years, including on OML 123. The operator got into trouble over some of its awards to Kaztec. A 2016 report from Deloitte raised concerns over more than $80mn paid by Addax to the engineering company. Addax declared force majeure on its contracts with Kaztec in 2015. Kaztec is developing a fabrication yard at Snake Island, in Lagos State. This work was thrown into jeopardy following Addaxs move. Chinas state-owned Sinopec acquired Addax in 2009. The loss of the four licences would leave Addax with just one stake in the Okwok marginal field. Addax was supposed to supply gas to a planned gas processing plant, which is at the heart of a legal scandal involving P&ID and the state of Nigeria. OML 123 was to provide gas. According to legal filings, Addax was initially interested in supplying gas but withdrew its support in June 2012.

809,Climate Deniers Regulating Texas Oil and Gas Avoid Blackout Scrutiny,gizmodo,"Apr 07, 2021",2021-04-07 15:50:00,"Texas blackouts were the result of multiple failures in the energy system, including oil and gas. Yet in late March, one of Texass most powerful oil and gas regulators, Christi Craddick, told the Texas legislature that the industry ""was the solution. that oil and gas operators were not the problem. In fact, Craddick said, the oil and gas industry was the solution. Advertisement But emails obtained by Earther show that the powerful commission that Craddick sits on, the Texas Railroad Commission, had such a loose regulatory grasp on the industry that it may have lacked crucial information on supply during the crisis. Craddick and the two other commissioners have rushed in the weeks following the crisis not to emphasize reforms they are making in their own organization, but rather to falsely cast blame on renewables . Despite its name, the Texas Railroad Commission (known as the RRC) doesnt actually have anything to do with railroads; the name is a holdover from the RRCs founding in 1891. Instead, the commission regulates the states sprawling oil and gas industry, including the vast network of pipelines. The commission is made up of three members, each of whom are elected by the public and serve six-year terms. Perhaps unsurprisingly for Texas, no Democrat has sat on the RRC since 1994 . The current slate also includes two commissioners who have denied climate science. The three commissioners, which include Craddick as well as Commissioners Jim Wright and Wayne Christian, are probably some of the most important oil and gas regulators in the world, said Kelly Mitchell, a senior analyst for Documented, a watchdog organization. The fact that at least two of the three of them have a history of climate denial is troubling, to say the least. Equally troubling is that the group in charge of overseeing the oil and gas infrastructure that powers a good portion of Texass grid doesnt require oil and gas producers to log any sort of information on well status during emergencies. In a Feb. 16 email exchange seen by Earther and obtained by Documented via a public records request, Wrights director of public affairs sent some colleagues questions from reporters asking how many wells had been shut down due to the storm and how much production had been lost.

She was recognized as one of Leading Ladies Africa 100 Most Inspiring Women in Nigeria 2019. She is married and a mother of four young adults. Vanguard had a chat with her on leadership, charting the business waters and navigating todays oil and gas industry and much more. As a renowned business leader born and living in a continent that is in dire need of transformational leadership, Audrey believes that leadership is about the commitment to serve people, creating value and impacting lives in ones sphere of influence. I have seen various types of leaders and leadership styles, but for me, leadership is propelled from the inward recognition of the privilege that it is to hold any form of influence in and over the life of a fellow human being; and a commitment to then steward that influence honorably, positively, and productively. she says. According to her, people can see through leadership that comes from an authentic place of service, one that is vested in the wellbeing of the led. The leaders who succeed over the long term are those who never lose their awe for the magnitude of the assignments they carry, who never allow pride or complacency distort their vision and appreciation for the positions they occupy. According to her, leadership is more effective when the leaders are open to ideas that are at variance from theirs, and who are willing to allow their people the opportunity to succeed or fail without blame, while trying out their own ideas. I think this is especially critical for many of us who are entrepreneurs, and especially those of us who are in owner-managed firms. We need to lead in ways that ensure our people are building capacity to be able to operate without us, whilst remaining loyal to the organization because they can see they are valued, and their best interests are well represented. In the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, studies show that women-led countries handled the pandemic better than their male counterparts. Does this mean that women make more effective leaders? For someone like her who has thrived over the years in a male dominated industry, what does it take to succeed in a mans world? Audrey believes that the term mans world is a coloration added by an unfortunate societal construct that has been passed down from one generation to the other. For her, she sees herself first as a human being that needs to be accountable to the breath of God that is within me. I believe that everyone, male and female, needs to first approach their lives with this primary understanding. She agrees that she, like other women in the gas industry is in a male dominated industry and for a woman to thrive in leadership or any male dominated role, she must first be audacious. Success demands boldness from you in any situation, and this has nothing to do with gender. So far as a woman knows that she is knowledgeable, competent, committed, and capable of making a difference, she should be bold and own her space. Audrey encourages todays woman to choose to use her voice, show up at the table, and add the value that she carries, standing her ground in the face of challenges and obstacles that she will inadvertently face. She was quick to add however, that she doesnt not recommend for a woman to try to be one of the boys in the name of trying to gain acceptability or fit in. According to her, a woman is not one of the boys and never will be. Women bring very unique sets of insights and competencies to the table, so it is important that we establish our competences and credibility as the best version of ourselves that we are. she adds. A woman in a male dominated field also needs to be strategic and tenacious. Unfortunately, there will be many who will be uncomfortable with your presence, but when you deliver excellent results with consistency, you earn respect from everyone, no matter how grudgingly. A woman in a male dominated environment must build the mental, emotional, psychological and I dare say, spiritual fortitude to bear up and bounce back time and again; and in so doing, it gets easier to deal with the difficulty that comes with these kinds of roles. Audrey acknowledges that it is important to have a good network of mentors, friends, and professional colleagues, both male and female, within and outside of ones industry to serve as a support system. It is important that you stay visible and establish yourself as a good leader and a solid part of your organization or associations. I believe it is important that you realize that men are people just like you. They have their own fears and insecurities, as well as their own struggles. We are all journeying through this life looking for the very best outcomes based on our abilities and the grace of God. On the most consistent challenges in the oil and gas landscape in Nigeria and Africa at large, Audrey believes that it is primarily the issue of continuity and stability in government, and then continuity of focus and direction in terms of policy and regulation. I believe that underpinning this is the lack of a broad strategic long-term vision for the nation and continent, and the tendency to personalize governance and glory. she admonishes.

811,Cautious Optimism Over Muzarabani Oil And Gas,263chat,"Apr 07, 2021",2021-04-07 11:16:39,"Green Governance Zimbabwe Trust (GGZT) says oil and gas prospects in Muzarabani, despite offering unique investment opportunities, should be viewed with cautiou Apr 7, 2021 Share Green Governance Zimbabwe Trust (GGZT) says oil and gas prospects in Muzarabani, despite offering unique investment opportunities, should be viewed with cautious optimism, as mineral wealth seldom translates to development. This follows the recent signing of a petroleum exploration development and production agreement (PEDPA) between the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) and two Australian firms Geo-Associates and Invictus. Geo-Associates owns the controlling stake in Invictus Energy, the Australia Stock Exchange-listed company which made significant progress in exploring oil and gas in Muzarabani. In a press statement, GGZT said it has been closely monitoring development in Muzarabani where reprocessed data gathered, Mobil in the1990s, shows evidence of the potential existence of oil and gas. GGZT views this new territory of untapped oil and gas deposits with cautious optimism despite unique and competitive investment opportunities, given that the industry has various potential downstream linkages. Previous experience of mining revenue- even in many resource-rich African countries, shows natural resource wealth does not always translate into sustainable economic development and improvement of human livelihoods. Broadly, GGZT urges government to adhere to principles of good governance, embrace Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), community beneficiation, environmental degradation and tax compliance to avoid conflict issues like the Mozambican case. As envisioned by GoZ is targeting energy self-sufficiency yet this cannot be a goal in itself if it does not stimulate a green industrial revolution which to sustainably implement poverty alleviation as a key priority given our low socio-economic status. Apart from the potential for energy self-sufficiency, electricity generation, production of liquid petroleum, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), fertilizer production and petro-chemicals, opportunities which must be leveraged, read part of the statement. Mines and Mining Development Minister, Winston Chitando recently signed on behalf of government with the international firms involved in hydrocarbons prospecting to start a development programme for the asset. On its part government has been touting the oil and gas prospects as a game changers, with Chitando claiming that successful exploration could see the country producing oil by next year. Chitando said the signing of the PEDPA-which provides the framework for rapid progression of the Muzarabani oil and gas project offers value chain benefits, new investments and technologies accruing from exploration. However without open contracting, a globally accepted norm which boost transparency and accountability, anticipated investments of between US$15 million and US$30 million to drill two oil and gas test wells in Muzarabani by October 2021 could be without tangible benefits. GGZT admits that general development of oil and gas can unlock foreign revenues, create jobs and boost economic growth, but urges government, based on previous experiences, to promote responsible investment. Delays in the finalization of amendments to the Mines and Mineral Bill was also pointed as a structural barrier to successful exploitation of vast mineral wealth, with recommendations for the enactment of a Petroleum Law. It is without doubt that successful exploration of Zimbabwes oil and gas industry represents a huge, unique and competitive investment opportunities given the significant potential for value chain linkages. GoZ must demonstrate commitment to improve the regulatory environment of the mining sector first, consult widely on the exploration of hydrocarbons, including gas with a view of setting a comprehensive Petroleum Law. These announcements have given rise to much excitement for ordinary Zimbabweans hoping for improvements in their living conditions, it seems government is looking forward to billions of dollars in export revenues and foreign direct investment (FDI). As there has been hardly any progress in amending the Mines and Minerals Bill a key legislation, the new oil and gas subsector presents another huge opportunity for government to chart a new path of promoting good governance, said GGZT.

She is a Fellow of the Energy Institute (FEI), the chartered professional membership body of global energy experts. She is a founding member, Women in Energy Network (WiEN); member and global role model, Women in LPG (WiNLPG) Nigeria chapter; member of the NCCF Diversity Sectoral Working Group of the Nigeria Content Development & Monitoring Board (NCDMB).

She is a prolific writer and author with four books, and has won multiple awards including the prestigious Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year West Africa Award 2014, Female Entrepreneur of the Year 2015 Award, and Lagos Business School Distinguished Alumni Award 2018. She was recognized as one of Leading Ladies Africa 100 Most Inspiring Women in Nigeria 2019. She is married and a mother of four young adults. Vanguard had a chat with her on leadership, charting the business waters and navigating todays oil and gas industry and much more. As a renowned business leader born and living in a continent that is in dire need of transformational leadership, Audrey believes that leadership is about the commitment to serve people, creating value and impacting lives in ones sphere of influence. I have seen various types of leaders and leadership styles, but for me, leadership is propelled from the inward recognition of the privilege that it is to hold any form of influence in and over the life of a fellow human being; and a commitment to then steward that influence honorably, positively, and productively. she says. According to her, people can see through leadership that comes from an authentic place of service, one that is vested in the wellbeing of the led. The leaders who succeed over the long term are those who never lose their awe for the magnitude of the assignments they carry, who never allow pride or complacency distort their vision and appreciation for the positions they occupy. According to her, leadership is more effective when the leaders are open to ideas that are at variance from theirs, and who are willing to allow their people the opportunity to succeed or fail without blame, while trying out their own ideas. I think this is especially critical for many of us who are entrepreneurs, and especially those of us who are in owner-managed firms. We need to lead in ways that ensure our people are building capacity to be able to operate without us, whilst remaining loyal to the organization because they can see they are valued, and their best interests are well represented. In the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, studies show that women-led countries handled the pandemic better than their male counterparts. Does this mean that women make more effective leaders? For someone like her who has thrived over the years in a male dominated industry, what does it take to succeed in a mans world? Audrey believes that the term mans world is a coloration added by an unfortunate societal construct that has been passed down from one generation to the other. For her, she sees herself first as a human being that needs to be accountable to the breath of God that is within me. I believe that everyone, male and female, needs to first approach their lives with this primary understanding. She agrees that she, like other women in the gas industry is in a male dominated industry and for a woman to thrive in leadership or any male dominated role, she must first be audacious. Success demands boldness from you in any situation, and this has nothing to do with gender. So far as a woman knows that she is knowledgeable, competent, committed, and capable of making a difference, she should be bold and own her space. Audrey encourages todays woman to choose to use her voice, show up at the table, and add the value that she carries, standing her ground in the face of challenges and obstacles that she will inadvertently face. She was quick to add however, that she doesnt not recommend for a woman to try to be one of the boys in the name of trying to gain acceptability or fit in. According to her, a woman is not one of the boys and never will be. Women bring very unique sets of insights and competencies to the table, so it is important that we establish our competences and credibility as the best version of ourselves that we are. she adds. A woman in a male dominated field also needs to be strategic and tenacious. Unfortunately, there will be many who will be uncomfortable with your presence, but when you deliver excellent results with consistency, you earn respect from everyone, no matter how grudgingly. A woman in a male dominated environment must build the mental, emotional, psychological and I dare say, spiritual fortitude to bear up and bounce back time and again; and in so doing, it gets easier to deal with the difficulty that comes with these kinds of roles. Audrey acknowledges that it is important to have a good network of mentors, friends, and professional colleagues, both male and female, within and outside of ones industry to serve as a support system. It is important that you stay visible and establish yourself as a good leader and a solid part of your organization or associations. I believe it is important that you realize that men are people just like you. They have their own fears and insecurities, as well as their own struggles. We are all journeying through this life looking for the very best outcomes based on our abilities and the grace of God. On the most consistent challenges in the oil and gas landscape in Nigeria and Africa at large, Audrey believes that it is primarily the issue of continuity and stability in government, and then continuity of focus and direction in terms of policy and regulation. I believe that underpinning this is the lack of a broad strategic long-term vision for the nation and continent, and the tendency to personalize governance and glory. she admonishes.

Oil company or energy company? In a paper by Matthias J. Pickl results show that of the eight major oil companies, five have undertaken considerable investments in renewable energy. Their renewable energy strategies reveal a categorization into two main groups: Royal Dutch Shell, Total, BP, Eni and Equinor have embarked on a transition from being oil companies to energy companies; while ExxonMobil, Chevron and Petrobras remain focused on hydrocarbons. Natural gas is used extensively in the generation of electricity, partly because it is cleaner than coal but also more cost competitive. This is the main approach that Exxon and Chevron have taken, sticking with what they know best  transitioning away from oil by investing more in natural gas. Renewable energy and electricity lie outside the core competencies of big oilso acquisition is an easy but conservative first step. It is a conservative step. Gas is cleaner than coal, but it is still a fossil fuel. There is a strong interaction between oil companies and utilities because the former produces raw materials needed for generation of electricity by the latter. The choice of wind and solar power sources for electricity generation significantly reduces demand for coal and oil, but less so for natural gas. Electricity sector. Cleaning up the electricity sector is a key target for economywide decarbonization because emissions from electricity generation (27%) and residential/commercial emission sources (12%) are equivalent to 39% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions ( 2018 US Environmental Protection Agency data ). Transportation sector. Electrification is here to stay, and as the exponential growth in manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles around the world highlights, this demand will help to lower the 28% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that are contributed by transportation. This potentially rapid shift to electric vehicles will decrease the need for gasoline and diesel fuel from oil companies. Transition. The use of the term net in net-zero means that the pluses and minuses on the emissions front will total zero  not that petrochemical companies will stop producing oil and gas. The oil majors will remain integrated oil giants with an increased presence in the electricity space to increase diversification. 7-day Inbox + Full Digital Access starting at $1.00/wk.

A Sierra Club report titled, The Dirty Truth about Utility Climate Pledges recommends that utilities do three things: retire existing coal plants by 2030, terminate plans to build new gas plants, and build clean energy faster. The analysis is based on integrated resource plans (IRPs) and major announcements for the 50 U.S. utilities that remain the most invested in fossil fuel generation. Plans were examined for 79 operating companies owned by 50 different parent companies, representing more than half of all remaining coal and gas generation in the U.S. Not a good report card. Apart from a few pioneers, utility companies are falling short. The report assigned a score to utilities in the U.S. based on its plans to retire coal, construct new gas plants, and build new clean energy. The aggregate score for all companies studied was 17 out of 100. Readers can find their power company and its score in the report. For example, PacifiCorp (Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power) is the operating company with the most remaining coal without a retirement commitment (30% of energy generation), scoring 10 out of 100; Portland General Electric scored 48 out of 100. Notably, 22 out of 79 operating companies scored 0 out of 100, with no plans forecasting a change in direction. Climate goals. Out of the 50 parent companies included in the report, 33 have a stated climate goal; however, in general, most companies are not factoring their stated climate objectives into their latest IRPs. One reason is that net-zero emissions goals are set for 2050, 30 years away, while most IRPs have a duration of only 15 to 20 years. In other words, they claim they will reach net zero, but do not show how through their capital investments. Therefore, the Sierra Club report says utility climate goals should be legally binding; apply to all subsidiary companies; and include a short-term target of reducing emissions by at least 80% by 2030  confirmed by meaningful IRP commitments. Modeling the path ahead A whole atlas of model results are available to guide governments toward the formulation of a clean energy future. For example, Wrtsil has modeled 145 countries, including a breakdown for a dozen U.S. regions, to show the cost-optimal energy mix for producing electricity from 100% renewable energy sources. But, as with utility companies, laws and actions by governments and the willingness of the private sector, are required to transform these road map model results into reality. The Sierra Club report concludes that publicly stated climate goals are meaningless greenwashing without publishing strategies and investment plans to show how companies intend to get from point A to point B  just like the scholarship of Matthias J. Pickl demonstrated for the big oil companies. Scott Christiansen is an international agronomist with 35 years of experience.

Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page. Distroscale Good Morning! Think back to the 1990s and early 2000s when the rise in technology brought on a hollowing out of North Americas labour market as manual jobs became automated. The loss of middle skilled, middle income jobs was staggering. The U.S. shed 6.2 million manufacturing jobs between 1998 and 2010; Canada, 625,000, the economic effects of which are still being felt today, says a new report by TD Economics. Canadas energy sector saved it from the worst of this transition. While manufacturing jobs fell, jobs in the booming oil and gas sector soared 71% between 2001 and 2014. However, this is now about to change, write TD chief economist Beata Caranci and senior economist Francis Fong. The economists say the jobs devastation of manufacturings decline in the 1990s is at risk of being repeated as Canada and the world move to a low-carbon economy. Ottawas commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 will bring a seismic shift to Canadas oil and gas industry. They estimate that demand for oil and gas in North America will need to fall by half to reach the net zero target. About 600,000 people now work directly or indirectly in that sector in Canada, mainly in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador. By 2050, 50% to 75% of those workers are at risk of being displaced by the transition to clean energy, between 312,000 and 450,000 workers. There is a belief that many of these workers will be absorbed into the clean energy sector, but the economists again cite manufacturings decline as a cautionary tale. The reason that was such a rocky transition was because technology created very different jobs in different areas of the country. For example, among the top states to suffer manufacturing job losses, only Michigan benefited from the job gains between 2010 and 2019. The same goes for today. The economists stress that traditional oil and gas production will not disappear completely, but the development of new clean energies may not be dependant upon sitting on top of fossil fuel deposits. Ontario is already establishing itself in the green transition. Home to more than 40% of Canadas wind capacity and 98% of solar capacity, the province has tremendous opportunity to build on its renewables sector and potentially shift its energy supply away from Western Canada. In order to avoid the mistakes of the past, the economists have three recommendations for policy makers. Focus clean energy infrastructure and development within the communities that will suffer the worst effects of the transition. Identify the skills needed in the clean energy sector and work with industry to design training programs that complement the Canada Training Benefit. Income supports that could partially offset losses for workers put out of a job, with specific programs for older workers, such as pension bridging grants. The economists say the clean energy transition offers a huge opportunity to redefine and reinvigorate Canadas energy sector, and companies here have the potential to become global leaders because of their experience with major projects. But history has shown that left to market forces such a transition can give rise to inequality and underemployment. Policymakers should not underestimate the structural shifts bearing down on oil and gas workers. A more innovative approach to labour market shifts should be considered and prioritized in parallel to climate emission targets as a means to mitigate negative unintended economic and social consequences, said Caranci and Fong.

Company to also invest around $59.4m on Kicking Horses assets in 2021 Kicking Horse to be acquired by Whitecap Resources. (Credit: 15299 from Pixabay) Whitecap Resources has agreed to acquire rival Canadian upstream company Kicking Horse Oil & Gas for CAD300m ($237.8m) in a cash-cum-stock deal. As per the terms of the deal, Kicking Horses shareholders will be issued 34.5 million shares of Whitecap Resources plus CAD56 million ($44.4m) in cash. The consideration includes the assumption of Kicking Horses net debt of CAD54m ($42.8m), as of 28 February 2021. Kicking Horse, which is based in Calgary, is an indirect subsidiary of Quantum Energy Partners, a US-based private equity firm. Quantum Energy Partners partner Garry Tanner said: We believe in the Whitecap story of disciplined leadership, superior execution, and low decline, high net-back assets with strong free cash flow. We also recognize their commitment to ESG reflected in their zero net emissions which will become essential for the oil and gas companies of the future. We are proud to be affiliated with Whitecap and look forward to continuing our strong partnership moving forward. Kicking Horses core operation is the condensate rich Alberta Montney development in Kakwa where it currently produces nearly 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Whitecap Resources expects the production to be optimised to reach 18,000-19,000boe/d over the coming 12-15 months for maximising free funds flow. According to the company, Kicking Horses assets in the Alberta Montney, complement its existing Montney position at Karr and have considerable offsetting activity. Through the acquisition, Whitecap Resources will be adding 92 or 60 net sections of Montney rights that are 99% operated. The assets have an average working interest of 65%, and give scope for further consolidation of working interest, said the company. Whitecap Resources total acreage in the Montney play is now 168 sections in which 696 drilling locations have been identified. Whitecap Resources president and CEO Grant Fagerheim said: We are excited about adding this asset to our portfolio as an advancement of our Montney growth strategy, creating an additional opportunity for our team to further generate strong returns for our shareholders. As we have integrated the NAL and TORC assets over the past several months, our teams execution has been exceptional, and we are confident that will remain the same with this new asset. Last year, Whitecap Resources had acquired TORC Oil & Gasand NAL Resources, two of its rival oil and gas producers in Canada, for about $703m and $118m, respectively. The company revealed plans to invest CAD75m ($59.4m) on Kicking Horses assets in 2021. This will help in the completion of four wells that are presently being drilled and in the drilling of six more wells. Production from six of the 10 wells is likely to commence by the year-end. Whitecap Resources expects to close the deal by 31 May 2021. This will be subject to customary closing conditions such as Kicking Horses shareholders approval and the required regulatory approvals.

Gas & oil prices increase; could higher oil prices help Louisianas energy sector? State hopes oil industry can rebound as oil and gas prices continue to rise By | April 6, 2021 at 6:16 PM CDT - Updated April 6 at 6:16 PM NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Prices at the gasoline pump are causing some local drivers to fret. And the cost of oil has gone up as well. I think theyre ridiculous, you know, said a man fueling his vehicle who identified himself as Mr. B. If they go up, I got to keep on, I got to go to work, you know. More vehicles appear to be on roadways as more of the economy reopens amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Cintrell Rock did not like the gas prices she saw after stopping for gasoline. I feel like its going to be $3 before the end of the month. Thats the way its looking, said Rock. According to AAA, the average cost of a gallon of unleaded regular in Louisiana is $2.62. In some parts of the state, it is over $2.80 a gallon. Professor Eric Smith, Associate Director of Tulanes Energy Institute says part of what is driving the higher gasoline prices is the freezing weather earlier this year. Yeah, we lost the refinery production as well as the crude production during the freeze and the system is still catching up, said Smith. And more drivers could take to the road during the summer months as part of vacations. I think we had a 13-week run here of higher prices but theyre still, you know, considerably less than they were back in 2008, and then in 2012 we had a run of high prices, Smith stated. Gasoline is made from crude oil. Generally, the biggest single cost of gasoline is the cost of the crude itself, said Smith. Oil prices are currently around $60 a barrel. Mike Moncla is President of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, also called LOGA. The oil prices have gone up into the $60s, so we have a seen an influx in some activity around the state which is good for Louisiana, said Moncla. He was asked about the type of new activity being experienced by the oil and gas industry. You know, just well site stuff whether it be workovers, cement jobs, different service activities at the well site, said Moncla. He responded to a question about the major factors that drive oil industry employment. Well, its going to be well site activity, when I say well site activity, Im talking about oil companies have a well that has been shut-in that they need to get back working, so theyll call service companies to go back out to that well site and get that well back working, said Moncla. And he believes oil prices need to be much higher in order for the states oil and gas industry to see a rebound. We would need higher oil prices. I mean if oil gets up into the $80s, you know, that might not be great for America, but it would be great for South Louisiana, said Moncla. Michael Hecht is President & CEO of GNO Inc., an economic development organization. Its unclear to me how its going to translate over time. Without a doubt if demand goes up globally and energy prices continue to be in the profitable range then you will also see people going back into that industry, said Hecht. Still, so far this year it appears things are shaping up to be better for the oil and gas industry in Louisiana. Its certainly an improvement from last year if theres a one-word I guess, but its been a long seven years of this downturn and so its been a struggle for the oil and gas industry, the oil and gas workers that are out there, you know, trying to feed their families, a lot of them have had to find other jobs, Moncla stated. Smith thinks President Joe Bidens $2 trillion infrastructure would help to create jobs for the industry, as well. That will allow for some pipeline construction, it will allow for some highway construction, all those sorts of things and it will employ a lot of people, said Smith. Also included in that is money for the offshore regime to start removing platforms that are obsolete and inactive, so there are going to be some jobs that are added but nobodys burning down the barn to go out and drill deep-water and spend a billion or $2 billion on a new platform right now.

820,Should U.S. Oil Drillers Be Worried About Carbon Taxes?,oilprice,"Apr 06, 2021",2021-04-06 21:00:00,"As governments are looking to put a price on carbon or raise current carbon taxes, the oil and gas industry globally is bracing for the impact of those levies on the economies of upstream projects As governments are looking to put a price on carbon or raise current carbon taxes, the oil and gas industry globally is bracing for the impact of those levies on the economies of upstream projects.  The oil industry itself, for the most part, supports carbon pricing as one of the most efficient ways to reduce emissions and fight climate changethe two main drags on the oil sector since the energy transition push became mainstream.  Carbon pricing is a tangible way for governments to make polluters pay, and the net-zero commitments of major economies suggest that putting a price on carbon could become increasingly popular in coming years, including in countries with vast oil and gas reserves such as the United States.  Carbon pricing could come either in the form of a fixed carbon tax rate or an emissions trading scheme ETS in which producers with higher emissions could potentially buy more carbon emissions from producers emitting less.  This, in turn, would affect the economics of oil and gas exploration and production projects, as well as the value of the assets, Wood Mackenzie says.  Oil and gas producers will not be caught off guard, however they have been modeling carbon pricing in projects and financial assumptions for some time, and they are also advocating for carbon pricing. The promoters of carbon pricing include Europes biggest oil firms, as well as the largest oil lobby in the United States, the American Petroleum Institute API, which has just conditionally endorsed the idea of carbon pricing.  Carbon Price Impact On Projects And Assets  Currently, there are more than 60 carbon levy regulations at various international, national, and regional levels. Yet, the existing rules impact very few major oil and gas producing areas at a rate above US$20 per ton, according to Graham Kellas, Wood Mackenzies Senior Vice President, Global Fiscal Research.  Related U.S. Oil Production Is About To Climb  The industry has already been including assumptions of carbon pricing in their financial models for some time, with most calculating carbon taxes of between US$40 and US$100 per ton.  As per WoodMacs estimates, most asset values will not be affected by carbon pricing if that levy is at US$40/ton. However, if the rate is as high as US$200 per ton, a third of all assets would have at least 50 percent of their remaining value of assets reduced.  The carbon pricing itself will be an important assumption in future asset values and project economics, but the actual tax treatment of carbon taxes in various legislations could be even more important, as it could mitigate the impact of a carbon tax on financials.  Our analysis shows that the fiscal treatment of carbon taxes is arguably more important than pricing, said Kyrah McKenzie from WoodMacs upstream research team.  There Cant Be Universal Carbon Pricing   Norways proposed tripling of the carbon taxin which the carbon price would be higher than $250 per ton in 2030could have less serious implications in Norway than if such a price is levied in other parts of the world, according to McKenzie. Thats because Norway has other tax legislation in place that would offset the impact. This includes high tax rates against which carbon taxes are deductible, as well as low carbon intensity, which also reduces producers exposure.  It is evident that carbon pricing is not a one-size-fits-all solution to making industries that pollute pay. Various countries have different tax regimes and different ways of collecting revenues from oil produced on their land or in their waters.  Countries with fiscal regimes including royalty, which is levied on gross revenue and does not allow deduction of operating costs, will be at a disadvantage relative to those with tax-centric systems. And for upstream operations governed by production sharing contracts mitigation will be even more complex, WoodMacs Kellas said.  Oil & Gas Industry Supports Carbon Pricing  The oil and gas industry is endorsing carbon pricing, with some European supermajors such as BP and Shell advocating for such measures for years, while others, such as the API, only recently supported the idea.  Last month, the API endorsed carbon pricing. However, the API wants it to be economy-wide and non-duplicative with other greenhouse gas regulations.  Related Video How To Love Pipelines and Fear Climate Change  BP also supports carbon pricing because, it says, it is needed, fair, efficient, and increasingly global.  According to BPs chairman Helge Lund, carbon pricing targets the root of the problem  carbon emissions  and harnesses the power of the market to create change. It gives companies financial incentives to invest in the energy transition  allocating capital, driving innovation, and scaling technology.  Equinor, which applies an internal carbon price of at least US$55 per ton of CO2 in its investment analysis, says it works with governments and other organizations to support carbon pricing and complementary climate and energy policies.  Most of the worlds biggest oil and gas companies now support putting a price on carbon as an incentive for polluters to reduce emissions. Most of those firms have come to the carbon-price debate well-prepared they apply assumptions of carbon costs in their investment analysis and portfolios.  Whenever more oil and gas-producing nationsincluding the United Statesdecide to levy carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, the industry will already have an idea which projects and assets would or wouldnt work at certain tax rate levels.

The PEDPA marked a major milestone in the quest to explore for commercially exploitable hydrocarbons in Zimbabwe and provides the basis for accelerated progression of the Muzarabani oil and gas initiative. Discovery of oil/gas means huge benefits for Zimbabwes stuttering economy, including energy self-reliance, production of petro-chemicals, Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), fertliser, increased exports and fiscal revenue among others. Invictus has successfully raised circa US$10.4 million (A$8m), through a share placement, to fund a 2D seismic campaign, procurement of long lead drilling equipment, basin design and working capital, ahead of exploration drilling this year. The Cabora Bassa Basin project, encompassing the Muzarabani Prospect, has entailed reprocessing and reinterpretation of a US$30 million highly promising data set gathered by Mobil in the early 1990s. Wildcat drilling, is a form of high-risk exploratory drilling, which entails drilling for oil or gas in unproven or fully exploited areas with no concrete historic production records or has been completely exhausted as a site for oil and gas output. We have analysed the hottest gas prospects of 2021 and present you the Top 5, fully cognisant of the fact that in depressed times the highest impact wells might come from high-risk wildcats, Oilprice.com said in a recent article. The site said Zimbabwe represented arguably the most disputable project in its Top Five ranking, given it has no known hydrocarbon reserves and has routinely relied on other neighbouring countries to cater for its energy needs. This year, however, might alter that picture completely as appraisal activity heats up in the African nations Rufunsa Basin, Oilprice.com wrote. This comes as Invictus Energy, operator of SG 4571, has had traversing over the prospective area for site acquisition and plans seismic surveying programmes in 2021 in preparation to drill the Mzarabani-1 oil/gas test well, a 4-way dip closure spread across over 200 square kilometres. The Muzarabani wildcat will be drilled around October-November 2021 to a total depth deeper than 4000 metres and will aim to confirm the prospects prospective resources of 4.5 Trillion Cubic feet. According to the operator (Invictus Energy), the total assessed reserves of the SG 4571 stand at 9.25TCf and 294 MMbbls, said. Other wildcat projects include Russias Skuratovskaya, Cyprus Cronos, Indonesias Rencong and Lebanons Block 09. Invictus Energy will invest between US$15 million and US$30 million towards drilling at least one oil and gas exploration well, before end of this year, chairman Joe Mutizwa said. Mtizwa said the ASX listed company was highly confident about the prospects for potential discovery of commercial quantities of oil and gas in Muzarabani. Speaking during the PEDPA signing ceremony at State House last Friday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwes oil and gas sector represented huge, unique and competitive investment opportunities given the significant potential for value chain linkages.

Over 400,000 oil and gas jobs could be lost in green energy transition: report by Posted Apr 6, 2021 7:09 am PDT Last Updated Apr 6, 2021 at 6:16 am PDT A large oil refinery along the Athabasca River in Alberta's Oilsands.  Fort McMurray, Alberta. (CREDIT: dan_prat, iStockPhoto) CALGARY (660 NEWS)  Canada could lose up to 450,000 of its 600,000 oil and gas sector worker by the year 2050. A new forecast by TD Economics shows Canadas pursuit of its climate targets could cost three-quarters of Canadian oil and gas jobs within the next 30 years. The projections believe this is a result of less demand for fossil fuels as more nations adopt net-zero greenhouse gas emission commitments. Canadas plan is to reduce emissions by up to 40 per cent by the year 2030, and go completely neutral by 2050. According to Natural Resources Canada, roughly 600,000 Canadians, mostly in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador, are either directly or indirectly employed in the oil and gas sector. The TD Economics report forecasts between 50 to 75 per cent of those workers are at risk of losing their jobs in the transition through 2050, equivalent to 312,000 to 450,000 workers. According to the report, over 25 per cent of Canadas greenhouse gas emissions comes from the oil and gas sector and as the country tries to reach its commitments, energy workers, mainly in Alberta, will be displaced. The report also explains not everyone who will face unemployment will be able to find a job in the clean energy sector. The report points to the 1990s and the transition from manual work to automation for the manufacturing sector, which resulted in many middle-income workers being displaced with little to no help in transitioning back into the economy. It is critical that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past and ensure a just transition for energy sector workers. the report reads. Relative to the U.S., Canada was spared some of the hollowing out of middle-income jobs and resulting inequality due to the presence of energy sector jobs. However, this is now about to change. The report outlines three major areas that can help with the transition to green energy. These include a redesigned retraining program for these workers; focusing clean energy infrastructure on the same communities, and income supports to offset losses for employees. The report acknowledges the clean-energy transition will create many new job opportunities, but there is no guarantee the benefits will be easily passed on to those displaced from the oil and gas sector.",https://www.citynews1130.com/2021/04/06/oil-and-gas-jobs-could-be-lost-in-green-energy-transition/

Wyoming, Louisiana and 12 other states filed the lawsuit last month claiming Biden's executive order banning new oil and gas leases on federal lands violates federal law. Leaders in fourteen other states are standing up for their energy industry and its pathetic to see New Mexicos Attorney General sit on the sidelines,"" Larry Behrens, Western States Director for Power The Future, told The Center Square. ""[AG] Hector Balderas was more than happy to sue the previous administration when his eco-left supporters demanded it. Now that New Mexico is losing rigs to Texas, Balderas is silent."" About 55% of oil and gas wells in New Mexico are drilled on federal lands, particularly in the Permian Basin. In Texas, oil and gas drilling in the Permian Basin is largely done on private land, which won't be affected by Biden's order. ""Its past time New Mexicos leaders stand up for our workers before their out-of-state, eco-left supporters, Behrens said. A Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas report estimates that by the end of 2025, the Permian Basin will produce between 230,000 and 490,000 barrels per day less than if drilling activity continued at its current pace. As a result, production and employment across the basin will gradually shift from federal lands in New Mexico to private and state lands in New Mexico and Texas, with wide-ranging economic implications for the region. The 14-state lawsuit alleges that the U.S. Department of Interior violated federal law by not taking public input before implementing the executive order that halted new lease sales. President Joe Biden signed the executive order on Jan. 27 as part of his administrations aggressive efforts to curb climate change and prioritizing green energy. The lawsuit also alleges state government and the public were denied an opportunity to participate in the decision-making process in violation of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act.",https://www.livingstonparishnews.com/breaking_news/oil-and-gas-advocate-criticizes-new-mexico-ag-for-not-joining-multi-state-lawsuit-against/article_b708c6a0-964b-11eb-93fd-bb1e4a43079c.html

April 6, 2021 LinkedIn The Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) has restated its resolve to serve as a catalyst for the industrialisation of the Nigerian Oil and Gas industry and its linkage sectors. Simbi Wabote, the Executive Secretary, who disclosed this at a recent forum, said his agency had partnered with investors in modular refineries, manufacturing of LPG cylinders, LPG Depots, gas processing facilities, lube oil production plant, and a methanol plant using gas as feed stock. Speaking further, Wabote listed some policies introduced by the Board to support women in the oil and gas industry to include the inauguration of the Diversity Sectorial Working Group in the Nigerian Content Consultative Forum (NCCF) and the creation of the Women in Oil and Gas Product in the Nigerian Content Intervention Fund (NCI Fund). He explained that the Bank of Industry (BoI) is responsible for managing the NCI Fund, assessing applications and disbursing loans to approved companies. He said: the NCI Fund is one of the most successful loan schemes. About 98 percent of the borrowers are paying back because we go through a very rigorous process. He spoke on the Project 100 Initiative of the Board, adding that it was designed to nurture 100 wholly owned oil and gas service providers in a competitive and sustainable way through targeted interventions, into larger scale players that create high impact. He confirmed that some Project 100 companies are owned and managed by women and the participants were selected through a transparent process without recommendation from any quarters. The NCDMB chieftain also commended women for creating a forum to advance their cause in the oil and gas industry and counselled them against operating in splinter groups. He advocated the need for the inclusion of more women in decision he Boards Governing Council and the top management committee had implemented a policy of having at least one lady to ensure gender balance and provide unique perspectives in decision making. He also said his agency only partnered with strategic policies and projects that are promoted by the Federal Government and would not invest in oil and gas businesses that have competitive private players. He clarified that the Board would not invest in competitive business areas because such investments would compromise its morale position as a regulatory agency. Our role is to act as a catalyst of strategic government policies and programmes and we exit once those businesses become successful, he added. He also stated that NCDMB is a regulatory agency and not an interventionist organisation and would not get involved in programmes outside its mandate.

827,Where Can My Oil and Gas Skills Take Me in the Energy Transition? |Rigzone,rigzone,"Apr 06, 2021",2021-04-06 08:15:04,"A report finds that more than one-third of the oil and gas sector is considering pursuing opportunities in renewables. Tweet A report finds that more than one-third of the oil and gas sector is considering pursuing opportunities in renewables. As the energy landscape changes and the workforce faces instability, people of all stages in their professional career are asking how they can apply skills, knowledge, and training to areas such as renewables and geothermal energy. ""The oil, gas and chemicals industry was built on human ingenuity; innovation and grit; and it is that same spirit that will forge the industrys next reboot and revitalization, Duane Dickson, Deloitte vice chairman and U.S. oil, gas and chemicals leader, commented in a written statement highlighting his firms study The Future of Work in Oil, Gas and Chemicals: Opportunity in the Time of Change . Companies that choose to see the coming decade as an opportunity for transformation will likely not just outlive this compression but may even lead the industry into the future of work. By putting people at the core of business transformation strategies, the industry may hopefully regain its appeal and position itself for whats expected to be a much different landscape in the future. Transitioning skills from traditional energy sectors: What research shows Skill gaps will be the driver behind the learning curve employers are already seeing between jobs in the oil and gas industry and roles in renewables, said Beth Bowen, president, The AmericasBrunel (AMS: BRNL), a global workforce provider focusing on engineering and technical solutions across the oil and gas industry, mining, renewables, and life sciences. According to Energy Outlook Report 2021 , developed in part by Brunel, companies are looking at closing the skills gap by targeting transferable skills from other industries, training and development of existing workforce, and partnering with colleges, to name a few. We expect the learning curve to vary based on the type of role that is actually transitioning, for example, whether its technology or word process driven, Bowen said. We see helping potential employees close this gap as the number one essential piece to ensuring there is the available future workforce for renewables. The report  based on data from more than 22,000 energy employees, job searchers, recruiters, and companies  states that more than one-third of the oil and gas sector is considering pursuing opportunities in renewables, while only 12.3 percent are considering chemical engineering. Daniel Raimi, published author and teacher of an energy and climate change policy class at the University of Michigan, said renewables seem to interest many of the students hes taught during the years. Also a Fellow at Washington, D.C.s nonprofit research institution Resources For the Future (RFF), Raimi said there may now be very different implications for people and communities that rely on the oil and gas industry than during a traditional three- or four-year boom/bust. From his perspective, that means climate and policy changes will (or at least should) play a big part in the energy transition if policy-makers are serious about addressing these challenges, he said. I have a lot of students who are enthusiastic about engaging directly in policy and politics to effect the change they want to see in the world, Raimi said, noting some of his students are now at companies such as ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB), Total (NYSE: TOT), DTE Energy (NYSE: DTE), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and electric vehicle start-up Rivian, which is selling 100,000 vehicles to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) as part of its pledge to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, according to a published in February. Answering the call for training and development More than 40 percent of employees feel insufficient education and training is the biggest driver of the worsening skills shortage, according to Energy Outlook Report 2021. And its something the workforce wants included in compensation packages, that and job stability. I think its a good opportunity for especially the renewable space if companies can create an overall compensation package of training, long-term career progression, and stability, Bowen said. I think the first companies to get it right are going to have a real advantage attracting top talent. Brunel is teaming with Energy Delta Institute to launch the first post-graduate degree in hydrogen for experienced technical and legal professionals . This is a technology Raimi said he was hopeful could be explored more. The driver for this partnership comes from critical needs in a changing world to secure and transition highly experienced specialists and take them from a traditional energy skillset to more environmentally friendly technologies, Bowen said. Raimi is passionate about these topics as well, believing policies, education, and programs are needed most to help much of the displaced workforce make a move to other industry sectors. If we are going to take our climate change problem seriously its going to mean a transition that weve never seen before, and its going to affect a lot of people, he said. My recent work has mostly been focused on what public policies can be most helpful to support the people in the places that are affected by this transition. We dont have all the answers, but we know that workforce training is going to be an important part of the solution.",https://www.rigzone.com/news/where_can_my_oil_and_gas_skills_take_me_in_the_energy_transition-06-apr-2021-165046-article/

Some of the countries, particularly in North America, have registered a significant increase in oil production. But the existing pipelines were not originally designed to handle the high flow rate.  In North America, particularly in Canada and the United States, the permits to build entirely new pipelines are getting harder to attain, owing to increased regulations and environmental concerns related to oil pipelines. As a result, the operators are expanding the existing pipelines. For example, the line 3 expansion project, which passes through Canada and the US is one of the largest pipeline expansion projects in the world.  Majority of the new pipeline projects are for gas pipeline owing to the growing demand from the emerging countries like India, China, and other Southeast Asian countries, which lack enough gas transportation infrastructure, and also to meet the demand from western countries like United States, Canada, and Australia amongst others, which are aiming to increase the share of gas in their net energy consumption..

Energy relations between India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, and Saudi Arabia have soured as global oil prices spiked. New Delhi blames cuts by the Saudis and other oil producers for driving up crude prices as its economy tries to recover from the pandemic. State-run refiners have placed orders to buy 9.5 million barrels of Saudi oil in May, compared with the previously planned 10.8 million barrels, three sources said. The refiners - Indian Oil Corp Bharat Petroleum Corp Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Mangalore Refinery and PetrochemicalsLtd - normally buy 14.8 million barrels of Saudi oil in a month. The decision to place nominations for less oil was taken on Monday, within two days of a telephone conversation between Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and his Saudi counterpart Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Saturday, three sources said. Contents of the conversation between the two ministers is not known. No immediate comment was available from the Indian companies, Saudi Aramco or the Saudi oil ministry. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, agreed on Thursday to gradually ease their oil output cuts from May, after the new U.S. administration called on Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the group, to keep energy affordable for consumers. On Sunday Saudi Aramco, the state oil company of the Kingdom, raised official selling price, or OSP, of its oil for Asia while cutting it for Europe and American markets. ""We were surprised when they announced cuts for other markets while raising OSPs for Asia,"" said one of the sources. India suggested refiners look for energy alternatives to Gulf oil, its main source of crude. Tensions between the two countries further escalated after Abdulaziz last month advised India to use the stocks of crude it bought cheaply during the price slump in 2020. Pradhan termed Abdulaziz's response as ""undiplomatic"". To dial down the disagreement, Abdulaziz last week said Aramco maintained normal April oil supplies to Indian refiners while cutting volumes for other buyers and conceded that voluntary output curbs has put ""Aramco in some difficulty with some of its partners"". He also said that Saudi will phase out its additional voluntary cut in stages by July. Meanwhile, Indian state refiners have begun diversification of purchases to include Brazil's Tupi grade, Guyana's Liza oil and Norway's Johan Sevredrup in their crude diet. ""We've always believed that crude supply should be market determined rather than artificially managed,"" Arindam Bagchi, spokesman for foreign affairs ministry said on Friday. He said even though OPEC+ has announced a slight easing of oil output cuts, they are still far below India's expectations.

832,Kodiak Oil & Gas' Year in Review -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 23:00:00,"A look back at a strong year for the Denver oil and gas outfit. Dec 15, 2011 at 12:00AM At the end of 2010, Kodiak Oil & Gas (NYSE: KOG) put forth its 2011 capital spending plan for the coming year. At $200 million, it was the largest projected investment in the company's history. Kodiak planned to drill 28 gross wells and complete 26 gross wells in the Bakken and Three Forks oil plays in North Dakota. The company expected to average 5,000 to 6,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, finishing the year at a production rate of 9,000 BOE/D. Let's see how things shaped up. North Dakota winter Despite inclement weather, road closures, and flooding, Kodiak charged out of the gate in the first quarter, posting sales 133% higher than the same quarter the year before. It reported a net loss, however, because of $9.3 million in derivatives losses. Kodiak also increased its capital expenditure budget to $220 million to compensate for adding another drilling rig into the field and for acreage acquisition. Mother Nature's reckoning Halfway through the year, Kodiak announced that it no longer expected to average 5,000 to 6,500 BOE/D because of a tough winter in the Bakken. The company reduced its outlook to 4,500 to 5,000 BOE/D, but maintained its goal of achieving 9,000 BOE/D by the end of the year. Its capital expenditure budget was bumped to $230 million. Expected well counts also rose to 42 gross wells. The acquisition At the end of June, Kodiak announced it had closed on an $85.5 million leasehold and assets acquisition in the Williston Basin of the Bakken play. Funding the purchase through cash and borrowings, the company boosted its total Bakken acreage to 100,000 net acres. As a result of the acquisition -- and with sales from the second quarter coming in higher than expected -- the company opted to increase its borrowing power, from $75 million to $110 million for its first lien senior secured revolving credit facility, and from $40 million to $55 million for its second lien term loan. It takes money to make money. It was a very good year By the middle of 2011, it was clear that Kodiak was having a strong year. Oil and gas sales broke company records, net income was up -- even in the face of derivatives losses -- and production was on pace to meet the company's end-of-year goals. Specifically, the company was operating five rigs and production was humming right along, reaching 7,500 to 8,000 BOE per day, and positioning the company well to hit its target of 9,000 BOE/D. Sky's the limit Apparently, merely achieving its goals were not enough. The company raised $650 million in a private offeringand picked up 50,000 more acres in the Bakken bringing its total to more than 150,000 net acres and completely changing future production outlooks. Kodiak now expects to finish the year at 17,000 BOE/D, with numbers expected to hit 30,000 BOE/D by the end of next year. 2011 was a year of tremendous growth for Kodiak. The company tripled in size, added acreage, and managed to post excellent results despite dealing with some unpredictable hardships of the Bakken climate for much of the beginning of the year.

833,EXCLUSIVE Nigeria refines energy reform bill to attract more Big Oil cash,oilandgas360,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 22:30:36,"The latest oil and gas news, dedicated to all things oil and gas: people, technologies, transactions, trends, and macro-economic analysis that impact commodity prices. Nigeria has sweetened the terms of a sweeping oil reform bill in a bid to attract much-needed investment to its oil industry, four people closely involved with the legislation said and a letter from oil companies, seen by Reuters, showed. Source: Reuters The proposed changes signal a shift by Africas largest oil producer and show the impact of an increasingly competitive environment in the energy business after 2020s global oil price collapse and an expected shift to renewables. Nigeria in 2019 had fast-tracked a law to boost its take of offshore oil revenue, a move industry experts said at the time could put billions of dollars of offshore oil investments at risk. Now Nigeria has changed its stance in an attempt to balance its immediate revenue demands with the need to lock-in long-term investment for its oil industry. The reform bill has been in the works for two decades, but the contentious nature of changes to Nigerias oil sector, which provides 90% of foreign exchange and nearly half the national budget, have scuppered previous versions. In January, a fist fight broke out between local community leaders during one of the public hearings on the bill. But with political alignment between President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly, the measure is expected to pass this year, though likely not before late May, the people said. Key changes to the bill would lower the royalties for new production from deepwater oilfields to 5% from 7.5% and boost the production level that triggers higher royalties from 15,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 50,000 bpd. For onshore and shallow water oilfields, it would reduce the hydrocarbon tax to 30% for converted leases, down from 42.5% in the original bill. The changes would also guarantee that state oil company NNPCs assets and liabilities would transfer to a limited liability corporation. This will help oil companies to collect money owed by NNPC. The Ministry of Petroleum declined to comment. NNPC did not respond to a request for comment. In the letter seen by Reuters, oil industry executives pushed for more changes, particularly around gas development and fiscal term stability which provides assurance that there will not be any unexpected changes in the royalties and tax regime. The executives said that terms are not sufficiently competitive to stimulate the desired new investments. Oil companies have noted that Nigeria got just 4% of the $70 billion invested in sanctioned projects in Africa between 2015 and 2019. NEED TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT Last year, oil industry analysts Wood Mackenzie had said Nigerias oil output could fall sharply without reforms. Gail Anderson, research director with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said of the changes to the bill: It shows that (the government) listened. They recognise the need to attract investment, not just in the Nigerian context but globally in the energy transition, Anderson said. The competition is going to be more intense, and this is a move in the right direction to attain and attract investment. But Anderson also said that not all the gas terms in the bill were good enough to spur development, which Nigeria has said it wants for its decade of gas. President Buhari originally sent the bill to the National Assembly in September. The legislative body has held two public hearings, but there have been a series of private consultations with stakeholders, including oil companies and community leaders that culminated in dozens of amendments. Legislators worked over the Easter holidays to consider the amendments, which the executive submitted in March. One proposed change, which would have instituted a mandatory review of fiscal terms every seven years, was removed after a backlash from companies concerned about stability of terms for projects with decades-long investment cycles.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/exclusive-nigeria-refines-energy-reform-bill-to-attract-more-big-oil-cash/

US Drillers Add Oil, Gas Rigs for Fifth Week in a Row Scott DiSavino, Reuters Fri, 04/16/2021 - 12:12 PM Your browser does not support the audio element. U.S. energy firms added oil and natural gas rigs for a fifth week in a row for the first time since February as higher oil prices in recent months prompted some drillers to return to the well pad. The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose seven to 439 in the week to April 16, its highest since April 2020, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co. said in its weekly report. That puts the rig count up 80% since falling to a record low of 244 in August 2020, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1940. The total count, however, is still 90 rigs, or 17%, below this time last year. U.S. oil rigs rose seven to 344 this week, while gas rigs rose one to 94, both their highest since April 2020. U.S. crude futures were up about 6% so far this month after gaining 65% over the prior five months as oil demand recovers from being crushed by the COVID-19 pandemic about a year ago. With prices mostly rising since October 2020, some energy firms said they plan to boost spending a bit in 2021 after cutting drilling and completion expenditures over the past two years. That spending increase, however, remains small as most firms continue to focus on boosting cash flow, reducing debt and increasing shareholder returns rather than adding output. Oil output from seven major shale formations was expected to rise for a third straight month, climbing by about 13,000 barrels per day (MMbbl/d) in May to 7.61 MMbbl/d, the Energy Information Administration said on April 12.

842,A New Use for Orphaned Oil and Gas Wells? |Rigzone,rigzone,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 12:38:38,"It's an alternative to P&A for some idle wells that could still create work for oil and gas pros. Tweet It's an alternative to P&A for some idle wells that could still create work for oil and gas pros. How best to reduce the massive backlog of idle oil and gas wells with unknown or insolvent operators, better known as orphan oil and gas wells, has been a prominent topic in the United States lately. The Biden administration, for instance, has proposed spending $16 billion on plugging and abandonment (P&A) activities via its broader, multitrillion-dollar infrastructure program. Others, notably the Texas Well Protected Energy Foundation profiled recently in Rigzone are calling for shifting responsibility for P&A from government to the nonprofit realm. More recently, Petrolern LLC  an Atlanta-based service and technology firm specializing in subsurface engineering and downhole tools  has advanced another idea: repurpose some of the orphaned oil and gas wells to produce geothermal energy. The company has developed a system called ConvertDeck that it maintains efficiently evaluates large numbers of orphaned wells to determine which are likely good candidates for geothermal conversion. Geothermal energy has up to now been a small contributor to U.S. and global energy, Alan J. Cohen, technology partnerships director with Petrolern, told Rigzone, adding the resource has primarily been exploited in high-temperature volcanic belts in certain regions of the globe. Drilling new geothermal wells is very expensive and can be up to 50% of the total project cost. Repurposing lower-temperature oil industry wells in sedimentary formations provides a valuable new source of geothermal energy. Cohen pointed out that sample conversion project proposals for various Petrolern clients show geothermal electricity costs below 4 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), adding that such projects can yield internal rates of return exceeding 10 percent as well as six-digit job creation. Moreover, he pointed out that wells converted to geothermal service release zero emissions. The system is entirely closed, he said. Cohen, along with two of his colleagues at Petrolern, shared additional details about the prospect of producing geothermal energy from orphaned oil and gas wells. Read on for their insights. Rigzone: Briefly, please explain what ConvertDeck is and how the system works. Alan J. Cohen: ConvertDeck is a patented, unique, expert system-based screening tool to select appropriate late-stage or unplugged/abandoned oil industrywells to convert them to profitable geothermal electricity or heat. It is a multi-faceted approach that integratesgeology, reservoir, wellbore, surface power plant, infrastructure, environmental, and economic criteria and how they are all connected and makes expertrecommendations for field conversion of the wells for use in geothermal power, heating, or cooling applications.  Rigzone: What makes an orphan oil and gas well a good candidate to become a geothermal well? Cohen: Petrolerns approach requires a good response in the several categories listed, essentially the right reservoir or aquifer and well bore conditions, proximity to electricity or heat markets, and with good economics. It is noted that blind selection of orphan wells for conversion may result in significant capital losses. A major value proposition of ConvertDeck, therefore, is de-risking conversion projects. Rigzone: With orphan wells, the operator is either unknown or insolvent. In the case of converting an orphaned oil and gas well to geothermal, who would operate the geothermal wells and how would operatorship be established? Cohen: Ownership issues are now under discussion with regulatory agencies in several states, so we dont wish to pre-empt these discussions. Rigzone: What are the steps necessary to convert an orphaned oil and gas well to geothermal service? Hamed Soroush, CEO, Petrolern: Well preparation Engineering the system if needed, includingexamining various aquifersand target zones in the well. and not simply the original producing zone. Perforations or recompletions may be needed. Installation of surface facility  the wellhead power plant Dispatch to the end users, and all the usual project administrative and contracting work for the wells, power plant, construction, financing, and power sales. The inaugural projects will use modular power systems with about 100 kilowatts of gross power. Later projects will involve larger power plants  5 megawatts or bigger. Rigzone: What sort of workers would be needed for this, and could people with oil and gas skill sets easily transfer their skills to geothermal well conversions? Soroush: Geologists, geophysicists, geomechanics engineers, reservoir engineers, well and completion engineers, chemical engineers, mechanical and electrical engineers. Oil and gas skills can definitely translate over and add significant value. Blue-collar workers would be especially needed on workover rigs, pump rigs, piping construction, and power plant operations and maintenance. We estimate that our approach can create up to 200,000 jobs, many of them redeploying oil and gas workers. Rigzone: How would energy from geothermal wells reach the electrical grid? Kevin Kitz, Power Systems Advisor, Petrolern: There are multiple options on how to monetize the thermal energy from converted wells. The most obvious is to put the power on the grid, which requires some type of power purchase agreement. But it may be more valuable to ship the power on privately owned power lines to a facility that can use it to serve house load. This could include other oil and gas operators, including displacing gas-fired compression, or larger industrial customers with a relatively steady power requirement. It is also possible, especially in colder climates, to ship geothermal heat instead of geothermal power. One of the first screening steps of ConvertDeck is to assess potential markets. If a low-temperature well is 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the nearest power line, that is not going to be a good candidate for conversion. Petrolern also has the expertise to identify the potential markets and to negotiate the contracts for that energy delivery. Rigzone: How does 4 cents per kWh for geothermal electricity  after deducting well-abandonment costs  compare to other electricity sources such as natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar? Cohen: We can achieve under 4 cents without subtracting well abandonment costs. When well abandonment is accounted for, we can in principle get close to 2 cents per kWh on some projects. That compares well with other electricity sources, especially when one considers that  except for periodic maintenance  the geothermal electricity is always on, whereas, solar and wind operate largely only at limited times during the day. Solar-generated electricity, for example, currently averages about 5 cents per kWh, and the U.S. Department of Energy has targeted it to reach 2 cents per kWh by 2030. We are already there on some of our geothermal projects.

843,Halcon Resources Corp: Management Potential Can't Overcome High Debt Load -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 09:03:00,"Lofty valuations and debt levels caused investors to overpay for Halcon Resources, which only now near 52-week lows trades at comparable valuations to competitors like Kodiak Oil & Gas and Oasis Petroleum. NYSE:OAS ) . These equally or larger sized producers have smaller debt loads and possibly better financial flexibility to grow production and reserves gong forward. Investors will watch these numbers very closely when the company reports. 2014 capital spending program Recently, Halcon Resources lowered its drilling and completions budget for 2014 by 14% to approximately $950 million. The reduced spending is not suppose to impact production guidance of 38,000 to 42,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or boe/d. The key, though, to investors is that the funding for growth comes from increased borrowings and the sale of more non-core assets. These additional sales will come on top of selling $300 million worth of assets that amounted to 21.2 million boe worth of proved reserves. Those assets produced 4,500 boe/d. Now the company is discussing unloading another $300 to $400 million worth of assets in 2014. On the flip side, Oasis Petroleum sits at multi-year highs. The energy producer focused on the North Dakota's Bakken shale forecasts growing production to 46,000 to 50,000 boe/d this year. The production forecast is for 40% growth along with an equivalent bump in capital spending to $1.43 billion. At the midpoint of 2014 guidance, Oasis will only produce 20% more boe/d than Halcon, but the much higher capital spending due to a better capital structure sets up the company for better growth in 2015 and beyond. Having a slightly higher enterprise value, Kodiak predicts full-year 2014 guidance of 42,000 to 44,000 boe/d after averaging 29,200 boe/d in the prior year. The company guided toward a 2014 capital spending program of roughly the same $1 billion that it spent in last year. Proved reserves Another major focus will be the proved reserves that Halcon ended with at the end of 2013. Based on divestitures, Halcon sits at around 85 million boe. Oasis Petroleum reported a 59% increase in proved reserves at the end of 2013 to reach 228 million boe. Importantly, 87% of estimated net proved reserves consist of oil. Kodiak saw proved reserves jump 77% to 167 million boe. The mix for Kodiak is roughly 83% oil. Bottom line Over the last couple of years, investors in Halcon have learned the difficult lesson that exceptional management teams can't overcome excessive valuations and high debt levels. Unless, Halcon Resources can generate a significantly larger growth in proven reserves, the stock trades at a similar enterprise value ratio to annual production forecasts to both Oasis Petroleum and Kodiak. Investors that overpaid for the stock in the past will probably not see a solid rebound in the stock unless the sector gains as a whole. If anything the smaller debt loads of Oasis and Kodiak probably leave those stocks with less risk for investors if oil prices were to plunge. So far management hasn't proven any exceptional ability to grow production and reserves faster than other comparable stocks so investors need to be careful paying a premium price.

An estimated 14.74 million tonnes per year, or 295,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude run capacity, will be added this year, bringing the country's total to 18 million bpd, CNPC's Economics and Technology Research Institute (ETRI) said in its annual industry outlook released on Friday. That could result in fuel exports surging 31.7% to a record 54.7 million tonnes. ""Taking into account domestic demand and exports, China will have at least 160 million tonnes/year surplus in refining capacity by 2025,"" CNPC said. The group also forecast China's net crude oil imports to grow 3.4% this year to a record of about 559 million tonnes, or 11.2 million bpd. Domestic fuel demand is expected to continue its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, said the group, which pegs gasoline use to grow 0.8% this year and aviation fuel to rise 13%, though diesel will ease 0.8%. The research group expects China's natural gas consumption to reach 354.2 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2021, up 8.6% on year amid increasing demand from residential heating, power generation and industrial use. Gas imports are forecasted to rise 12.5% to 158.5 bcm this year, with pipeline gas at 55 bcm and liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) at 103.5 bcm. ""We expect around 100 million tonnes per annum of LNG receiving capacity to be added over 2021-2025. But such big amount of new capacity would lower the utilisation rates at LNG terminals,"" said Wu Minjie, senior economist at CNPC's ETRI.

847,"Railroad commissioner dismisses wind, solar energy in leu of coal, oil production",mysoutex,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 05:00:00,"During Texas Energy Day 2021, Texas Oil &amp; Gas Association President Todd Staples sat down with Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian to talk about the year that was and President Joe Save During Texas Energy Day 2021, Texas Oil & Gas Association President Todd Staples sat down with Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian to talk about the year that was and President Joe Bidens administrations efforts to back solar and wind power  especially in the state of Texas. With San Patricio County home to several wind farms, which provide tax funds, Christian is eyeing the future of Texas energy as coal, oil and gas  especially through the rough year 2020 brought on the energy industries. The thing is, I have been really encouraged during all the hard things that the year brought, Christian said. The private free market industry can almost always do a better job than government regulations. Ive seen some of the biggest challenges  if not the biggest challenges  hit our industry this past year, and every single time we turn to the free market industry. They overperformed and came to the rescue much better than I think government has ever been designed to do and I think its a great Texas brag. Staples added, Well, you know, its interesting that some states and countries dont operate on the model of working together rather than working against one another. And I think thats how problems are solved. He said that just last year oil was at $24 a barrel and unsure what the future of COVID-19 would hold. Christian met with TXOGA last year and during the oil crisis who then formed the Blue Ribbon Task Force who met and strategized on how to keep the oil pumping during such a difficult time. So what happened of course was the industry saved the United States, Christian said. No doubt the oil and gas industry out here has, since the turn of the century, saved and revolutionized and made a safer, cleaner, better world. This past year specifically because we first were hit with a fight that OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and Russia got together and decided they were going to stop production and get prices going at the same time here comes China with this virus  were not supposed to call it that but Im sorry Mr. Biden  that caused a pandemic worldwide and decreased demand. He continued by saying that the past presidential administration did a great job working for the coal, oil and gas industry. He feels they had support in Washington on the congress and legislation level who were pro oil and gas and pro energy dominance all over the world and sees President Joe Bidens administration as a formidable foe due to his stopping the Keystone Pipeline and looking towards a greener, more environmentally safe future. I mean, (Bidens administration) has done everything you can think of so far to disrupt us, Christian said. It now costs three times the amount for energy for consumers with what theyve done. It puts more locomotives on the railroad tracks which are three times the cost. But Warren Buffetts company makes a lot of money from it. Then theres the Paris Accord, which were paying $78 billion for. Thats 10 trillion a year for the United States. As youre all aware that we now are living under that little darlin, and weve got to live under that for a term. Christian sites the carbon taxes along with rising fees and permitting is hurting the oil and gas energy more than most people realize. We dont need any new taxes and this carbon tax is going to be one that tries to dissuade the use of oil and gas, Christian said. So, theres a lot of challenges coming from the administration this next year so weve got to come together with some efforts to fight this. Christian continued by saying that Texas energy companies need help in their recovery while the president is putting money into renewables like wind and solar power. When the sun dont shine or the wind dont blow, we let the pilot light  go out on our dependables, Christian said. Theyve spent over 7 billion in just state tax dollars to get power lines out to the windmills when we put them in, and then weve been spending about a billion to a billion and a half  thats with a B  on it a year since then, and making sure that you buy, wind energy and solar energy before you buy natural gas energy. Were putting most of our tax dollars into the undependables at the cost and risk to lives. pgonzales@mysoutex.com",https://www.mysoutex.com/karnes_countywide/news/railroad-commissioner-dismisses-wind-solar-energy-in-leu-of-coal-oil-production/article_c87b141c-95e0-11eb-8b70-cbe981d6c458.html

JPMorgan Chase said Thursday it will commit more than $2.5 trillion over the next decade toward long-term solutions that tackle climate action and contribute to sustainable development. Within the initiative, $1 trillion is earmarked for green projects, including renewable energy and clean technologies that are focused on speeding the transition to a low-carbon economy. Source: CNBC The $2.5 trillion target, which begins this year and runs through the end of 2030, will also finance and facilitate transactions that support socioeconomic progress in developing countries, as well as economic inclusion in developed markets. The latter effort will focus on small business financing, home lending and affordable housing, education and health care. Included within this category is the $30 billion JPMorgan committed last October to closing the racial wealth gap in the U.S. Climate change and inequality are two of the critical issues of our time, and these new efforts will help create sustainable economic development that leads to a greener planet and critical investments in underserved communities, CEO Jamie Dimon said. Business, government and policy leaders must work together to support long-term solutions that advance economic inclusion, bolster sustainable development and further the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are committed to doing our part, he said. Thursdays announcement comes after JPMorgan said last fall it will establish emission targets for its financing portfolio . The firm said targets would be set on a sector-by-sector basis, and will first focus on the oil and gas, electric power, and automotive manufacturing sectors. The targets, which the firm said it would begin setting in 2021, will be within the parameters outlined by the 2015 Paris Agreement. Dimon also addressed the enormous opportunity created by the energy transition in his . Theres huge opportunity in sustainable and low-carbon technologies and businesses, he said. While many of these technologies and companies are mature, many more are just getting startedand more will need to be created in the coming decades. In addition, all companies will need capital and advice to help them innovate, evolve and become more efficient while staying competitive in a changing world, Dimon said in the letter. The bank facilitated in 2020 more than $220 billion in transactions related to sustainable development, more than $55 billion of which was for green initiatives. The total exceeded the firms initial $200 billion target for the year. Some believe the bank has not done enough.

850,Column: Oil prices find new equilibrium: Kemp,oilandgas360,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 02:00:35,"The latest oil and gas news, dedicated to all things oil and gas: people, technologies, transactions, trends, and macro-economic analysis that impact commodity prices. Crude prices appear to have found a temporary equilibrium in recent weeks, with OPEC+ planning to add just enough extra production to prevent prices rising further and draw in more output from U.S. shale firms. Source: Reuters Brents six-month calendar spread remains in a steep backwardation, implying traders expect the market to remain somewhat tight, with continued downward pressure on global inventories, in the second half of the year. OECD commercial petroleum inventories have fallen back in line with the pre-epidemic five-year average, according to estimates prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( https://tmsnrt.rs/3gdVk8k ). But front-month Brent prices have been broadly stable since mid-February, implying traders also expect OPEC+ to raise production enough to offset rebounding consumption, ensuring the market does not tighten further. Brents six-month spread is trading in a backwardation of $2.50 per barrel (the 82nd percentile for all trading days since 1990), down from $4.20 (96th percentile) on March 5. But the front-month futures price has increased just 4% over the last two months (58th percentile), down from a 24% increase (96th percentile) in the two months to March 5. Prices appear to have reached a temporary peak after rallying strongly for more than three months between the start of November and the middle of February. MARKET SHARING The oil market is likely to remain adequately supplied for the remainder of the year if prices stay around $65 per barrel, which would be very close to the long-term average over the last two or three decades in real terms. Prices at this level would continue to encourage a modest increase in drilling by shale firms and a rise in production through the rest of 2021 and into early 2022. But U.S. output increases would likely remain gradual and should be absorbed by the return of consumption as the epidemic passes and travel controls are relaxed, posing little threat to the market share of OPEC+. If prices rise much above this level, the production response from the shale sector is likely to accelerate, posing a threat to OPEC+ share, something the group appears keen to avoid. Iran, not currently subject to the OPEC+ production limits because it is under U.S. sanctions, has already been adding extra barrels to the market since the start of the year through covert sales to refiners in China. Rising covert exports helped ensure the market remained well-supplied during the first quarter, offseting some of the production restraint by the other members of the group. Provided restrictions on passenger aviation are gradually eased in the second half of the year, there should be enough consumption growth to absorb increases from U.S. shale, Iran and the rest of OPEC+. However, that delicate equilibrium depends on travel curbs being substantially eased in the next six months, and prices remaining close to current levels so as not to kindle a third shale boom.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/column-oil-prices-find-new-equilibrium-kemp/

852,Oil to hit $40 by 2030 if climate goals are met: consultancy,oilandgas360,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 01:00:00,"The latest oil and gas news, dedicated to all things oil and gas: people, technologies, transactions, trends, and macro-economic analysis that impact commodity prices. LONDON  Global oil prices could drop to around $40 a barrel by 2030 if governments push to reduce fuel consumption in step with U.N.-backed plans to limit global warming, a leading energy consultancy said on Thursday. Source; Reuters In a report outlining a scenario where the world acts decisively to tackle greenhouse gas emissions by electrifying transport and industry, Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie said oil consumption would begin a steep drop as early as in 2023. The decline in demand would accelerate to a rate of 2 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) to reach 35 million bpd by 2050, accounting for a 60% drop in carbon emissions from oil use from todays levels. Oil consumption hit a record of around 100 million bpd in 2019 and is expected to recover strongly this year after cratering last year due to the coronavirus epidemic. As a result, oil prices would begin to slip later this decade, WoodMac said in its report. Under its Accelerated Energy Transition scenario, it expects Brent crude prices to average $40 per barrel by 2030, compared with current prices of around $65 a barrel. By 2050, Brent may slide to $10 to $18 a barrel. (Graphic: WoodMacs oil price forecast  ) If we move to keep global warming to the 2 degrees Celsius limit set by the (U.N.-backed) Paris Agreement, the energy matrix will change  and change profoundly, said WoodMacs Ann-Louise Hittle. The worlds current policies are nevertheless far from aligned with the Paris agreement, with temperatures currently on course to rise by 3 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100, WoodMac stressed. A rapid decline in demand also means that existing sources of oil supplies would be sufficient to meet all future demand, with only limited need for new oifield developments, WoodMac said. A sharp fall in oil demand and prices in the coming decades would have a profound impact on major oil producers such as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, WoodMac said. The steep fall in demand prevents those key oil producers from managing the market and supporting prices in the way it does today. Despite losing their price-setting ability, however, low-cost Middle East OPEC producers remain core providers of oil. Natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, would, however, fare better than oil by replacing coal for power generation, particularly in fast-growing Asian economies, the report added. As oil prices declined, gas would eventually trade at a premium to oil under WoodMacs scenario. Benchmark U.S. Henry Hub prices are forecast to trade at $3 to $4 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) under WoodMacs scenario. Gas demand in Asia would increase on average by 1.5% a year through to 2050, offsetting declines in more mature markets, which would be switching to renewables from gas.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/oil-to-hit-40-by-2030-if-climate-goals-are-met-consultancy/

Oil & Gas Oil to hit $40 by 2030 if climate goals are met -consultancy The decline in demand would accelerate to a rate of 2 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) to reach 35 million bpd by 2050, accounting for a 60 per cent drop in carbon emissions from oil use from today's levels Reuters April 16, 2021, 04:45 IST LONDON: Global oilprices could drop to around $40 a barrel by 2030 if governments push to reduce fuel consumption in step with U.N.-backed plans to limit global warming, a leading energy consultancy said on Thursday. In a report outlining a scenario where the world acts decisively to tackle greenhouse gas emissions by electrifying transport and industry, Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenziesaid oil consumption would begin a steep drop as early as in 2023. The decline in demandwould accelerate to a rate of 2 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) to reach 35 million bpd by 2050, accounting for a 60 per cent drop in carbon emissions from oil use from today's levels. Oil consumption hit a record of around 100 million bpd in 2019 and is expected to recover strongly this year after cratering last year due to the coronavirus epidemic. As a result, oil prices would begin to slip later this decade, WoodMacsaid in its report. Under its Accelerated Energy Transition scenario, it expects Brent crude prices to average $40 per barrel by 2030, compared with current prices of around $65 a barrel. By 2050, Brent may slide to $10 to $18 a barrel. ""If we move to keep global warming to the 2 degrees Celsius limit set by the (U.N.-backed) Paris Agreement the energy matrix will change - and change profoundly,"" said WoodMac's Ann-Louise Hittle. The world's current policies are nevertheless far from aligned with the Paris agreement, with temperatures currently on course to rise by 3 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100, WoodMac stressed. A rapid decline in demand also means that existing sources of oil supplies would be sufficient to meet all future demand, with only limited need for new oifield developments, WoodMac said. A sharp fall in oil demand and prices in the coming decades would have a profound impact on major oil producers such as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, WoodMac said. ""The steep fall in demand prevents those key oil producers from managing the market and supporting prices in the way it does today. Despite losing their price-setting ability, however, low-cost Middle East OPEC producers remain core providers of oil."" Natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, would, however, fare better than oil by replacing coal for power generation, particularly in fast-growing Asian economies, the report added. As oil prices declined, gas would eventually trade at a premium to oil under WoodMac's scenario. Benchmark U.S. Henry Hubprices are forecast to trade at $3 to $4 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) under WoodMac's scenario. Gas demand in Asia would increase on average by 1.5 per cent a year through to 2050, offsetting declines in more mature markets, which would be switching to renewables from gas.

855,North Dakota oil production drops more than expected for February,willistonherald,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 23:13:00,"North Dakotas top oil and gas regulator attributed a larger than expected drop in the states oil and natural gas production to the Texas energy crisis that occurred in February. Save North Dakotas top oil and gas regulator attributed a larger than expected drop in the states oil and natural gas production to the Texas energy crisis that occurred in February. The situation in Texas caused problems for the Southwest Power Pool, which in turn forced rolling blackouts for Western Area Power Association for two days. The situation contributed to an overall 6 percent drop in oil production from 1.083 million barrels per day from 1.147 million barrels per day in January  twice the amount that had been expected, according to North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms. Natural gas, meanwhile, dropped a similar percentage  5 percent, going to 2.703 billion cubic feet per day from 2.849 billion cubic feet per day. Those (blackouts) impacted Williams, McKenzie and Divide counties, Helms said. So what we experienced, the best we can estimate is that Williams County saw about 3,000 barrels a day, monthly average, in terms of a drop because of the gas plant infrastructure shutdowns, as well as oil and gas wells. Mckenzie County dropped an average 9,000 barrels per day, and Dunn County about 5,000 barrels per day. Some gas plants, such as Little Missouri 4, also volunteered to temporarily cease operations, in a bid to help the power companies out. That contributed to gas capture rates dropping 2 percent, from 94 to 92 percent. Production stats are 8 percent below revenue forecasts, Helms said, but prices in February were 4 percent above forecast, and 20 percent above on Thursday, April 15. Thats making up for any lost volumes, Helms said, and the state wont need to adjust its forecasts at this point. Completions are tracking well with revenue forecasts, Helms said. There were 32 completions in February and 43 in March. The forecast is for between 30 and 40 between now and the first of July. That figure bumps to 40 to 50 in the second half of the year, and then 60 in the last six months of the 21/23 biennium. Lawsuits loom on regulatory front North Dakota might opt for litigation instead of comments when it comes to the Biden administrations review of oil and gas leases on federal lands. There are already some lawsuits filed in terms of that moratorium and not doing the March lease sale, Helms said. Whats undecided is whether to join one of those lawsuits or for North Dakota to initiate its own. North Dakota had three tracts nominated in northwestern North Dakota for the March lease sale, which got pulled because of the moratorium, and there appears to be little to no prospects of a lease sale in June. North Dakota will also be co-sponsoring with Texas a resolution at the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact opposing the Clean Futures Act. We are very encouraged by the action in the Senate and also the House of Representatives on Orphan Well funding, Helms added. That bill is being co-sponsored by Sen. Kevin Cramer.",https://www.willistonherald.com/news/oil_and_energy/north-dakota-oil-production-drops-more-than-expected-for-february/article_2a9090f2-9e40-11eb-86ed-ef1bd39bba07.html
856,5 Oil and Gas Companies That Pay Monthly Dividends -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 23:00:00,"Finding a monthly dividend payer provides flexibility to grow your portfolio or meet monthly obligations. Source: Yahoo! Finance. What's a royalty trust? A royalty trust is similar to a REIT but income is derived from oil and gas rights instead of real estate or mortgages. As long as the trust pays out 90% of earnings as distributions to shareholders, the trust can avoid corporate income taxes. With this special treatment, however, comes special tax reporting requirements, so be aware of that prior to purchasing royalty trusts. Their assets also deplete over time, so the income is not guaranteed to last beyond the life of the trust, and in some cases, shares become completely worthless when the trust ends. That said, Enduro Royalty Trust is brand-new, offered to investors in November 2011. Ownership provides the opportunity to share in the profits of oil and natural gas production from the trust's properties in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. San Juan Basin Royalty Trust is the largest U.S. royalty trust, also benefiting from production in New Mexico. Finally, Permian Basin Royalty Trust provides investors with a share of income from two properties in Texas. Two Canadian options Both Baytex Energy and Provident Energy are set up similar to the royalty trusts mentioned above. One difference is that they are based in Canada, but they also produce some of the oil and gas they sell. This is different from the U.S.-based royalty trusts, which are usually set up by banks solely to distribute the proceeds from other producers. Baytex Energy engages in the acquisition, development, and production of oil and natural gas in Western Canada and North Dakota. Formerly a trust, it acquired assets the past few years that led to it becoming more active in the actual production of oil and natural gas. Provident Energy has assets focused on three of the most important North American energy plays: the Alberta oil sands, the Bakken shale, and the Marcellus shale. Because of this, Pembina Pipeline announced its plan to purchasethe Canadian energy company last month. Dividends are great Though these aren't dividend payers in the traditional sense, their monthly dividend-like distributions could be used to pay some monthly expenses. In addition, they are a nice way to get some exposure to oil and natural gas in a world defined by fossil fuels.

865,Shell To Exhaust Dwindling Oil & Gas Reserves By 2040,oilprice,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 20:00:00,"Shell expects to have produced 75 percent of its current proved oil and gas reserves by 2030, and only around 3 percent after 2040 Shell expects to have produced 75 percent of its current proved oil and gas reserves by 2030, and only around 3 percent after 2040, the supermajor said in its Energy Transition Strategy that it will put to a non-binding shareholder vote next month.   Discussing the risk of stranded assets in the energy transition, Shell said that every year it tests its oil and gas portfolio under different scenarios, including prolonged low oil prices, and cross-references assets with break-even prices to assess if they would still be viable in case of low oil and gas prices.  At December 31, 2020, Shell estimated that around 70 percent ofits proved plus probable oil and gas reserves, known as 2P, will beproducedby 2030, and only 5 percent after 2040.   Shells proved oil and gas reserves have been declining in recent years, shrinking the reserves life to below eight years of production.

Thats reserves for just seven years of production, lower than most peers.  The declining reserves life is not unique for Shell. The largest international oil companies have seen their average crude reserves drop by 25 percent over the past five years, which could be a challenge for Big Oils production and earnings in the coming years, Citi said earlier this month.  The supermajors reported lower reserves in their most recent reports, also due to the 2020 oil price and oil demand collapse, which forced all of them to write off billions of U.S. dollars off the value of assets.   In Shells case, the declining reserves life is not in contradiction to its assessment from earlier this year that its oil production peaked in 2019 and is set for a continual decline over the next three decades.

866,Gas in the Tank: Cimarex Energy -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 15:08:00,"This rare, returns-focused energy company consistently rewards shareholders. ) Dec 31, 2012 at 4:08PM I've followed oil and gas producers for a long time, which has yielded three timeless, deceptively simple lessons. One: Asset intensive, cyclical businesses with huge operating leverage and fat debt loads are not an enduringly tasty recipe. Two: Given money, most management teams cannot resist the urge to drill a hole in the ground, build empires, or some combination of the two. Returns be damned. Three: complex financial transactions -- the likes of volumetric production payments or joint ventures -- can be the friend of shareholders and value accretive. But they're more often financial engineering. And yet, investors, for some reason, are always willing to take the bait. In an industry dominated by flavor-of-the-week fashions, cowboy capital allocators, and debt-laden growth junkies, Cimarex Energy ( NYSE:XEC ) is a breath of fresh air. Management stresses capital allocation, return on invested capital, and a conservative, steady-as-she-goes approach. That recipe has consistently and quietly rewarded shareholders. As markets fret over the fiscal cliff, elimination of tax breaks for E&P companies, and the state of the economy, Cimarex shares have languished. Foolishly minded investors can buy a returns-focused E&P whose transformation from a gas-focused player to oil and gas producer, ability to benefit from recovering natural gas prices and strong long-term demand prospects, and acquisition target potential remains wholly underappreciated by the market. I see return potential of 40% to 50%, and I'm buying a position equal to 3% of my 's capital. The business Strategy managers and C-level executives take note: Growth in and of itself is not the endgame. Cimarex managers take this notion to heart. Where many oil and gas execs lock themselves in conference rooms near fiscal year-end, ply themselves full of coffee, set growth targets, and leave it to mid-level managers to engineer a path, Cimarex doesn't set production growth targets. Instead, it focuses on a single metric: return on invested capital. Earning strong economic returns is agenda one, and everything else follows. The strategy has served shareholders well. From 2003 to present, returns on invested capital have averaged 15.3%, well above the firm's cost of capital. Production's more than tripled, and proved reserves have grown to 2 trillion cubic feet equivalent (tcfe). Understanding the industry's inevitable ebb and flow, management eschews complexities common to E&Ps, which often dilute shareholder returns -- joint venture partners and accordingly uncertain liabilities, equity issuances to fund drilling budgets, or huge debt counts. Cimarex's debt-to-capital currently sits at a modest 20%, and its share count has remained roughly static for six years running. Consistent with this mind-set, the company's drilling strategy targets projects according to perceived risk-reward, tilting toward those with the most favorable balance. In its current incarnation, Cimarex's spends most of its drilling budget on its substantial acreage positions in the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent, the most attractive of which is the Cana-Woodford Shale. Each year, a smidge of its drilling budget is directed to its Gulf Coast assets, where high-risk, high-return prospects occasionally gush cash. The company owns close to 450,000 Permian acres and 120,000 Cana-Woodford acres. Where recently flagging natural gas prices have turned gas-focused E&Ps into shrinking violets, these prospects contain sizable oil and natural gas liquids (or NGLs, whose pricing derives from oil, in the long run) reserves, offering excellent, relatively low-risk returns even in today's natural gas price environment. I estimate Cimarex's Permian acreage breaks even at oil prices below $40-$50, and its Mid-Continent prospects make money at around $3 . These are cherry properties. Cimarex's acreage provides multiple years' worth of drilling inventory, and possibly much more (more on that later). Historically a gas-focused E&P, Cimarex turned its focus to oily and liquids-rich prospects in recent years, as natural gas-focused prospects' economics flagged, a testament to its returns-focused approach. Many companies turned their eyes to the Permian and their oil brethren only recently, as horizontal drilling techniques and newfound oil potential awakened producers to their potential. They've chased returns, growth, and assets, paying sometimes absurd prices for acreage. Cimarex hasn't. Instead, the vast majority of its acreage is the product of its 2005 acquisition of Magnum Hunter, a transaction that looked awfully pricey at the time but now seems prescient -- it afforded Cimarex access to the Delaware Basin Bone Spring and emerging prospects in the Wolfcamp. Cimarex's current production mix is about 51% natural gas, 31% oil, and 18% natural gas liquids, but in the third quarter its revenue was 65% oil, 20% natural gas, and 15% natural gas liquids. From 2008 to 2011, oil production at 18% compounded annual growth rate, and natural gas liquids grew from virtually nothing to the current rate. Why buy? Today, Cimarex shares come cheap as investors fret over the fiscal cliff and world economy, discount the potential in Cimarex's assets, and fail to give account to a probable recovery to natural gas prices and very attractive long-term fundamentals. They do that at their peril. And Cimarex's acquisition target charm is a nice kicker. Read on, Fool. 1. Potential in the Permian (and Mid-Continent): Investors might mistakenly think that the Permian is a single blot on the map. Describing the Permian as a single entity is kind of like calling Pittsburgh and St. Louis the same city because they're both in the Midwest. The reality is much more nuanced. Some areas of the Permian breakeven at $20 or $30 a barrel, and others lose even at $80 a barrel. Cimarex's acreage falls at the lower end of that range, but could trend even lower. Likewise, while the company estimates several years of drilling prospects, they could be much greater. To get a sense, consider the company's progress in the Mid-Continent: By drilling multiple wells from a single rig (called pad drilling), the company's reduced its well cost from $8.5 million a year ago to $7 million to $7.5 million and taken drilling times down. By drilling wells at closer intervals (down-spacing, in industry speak), it's also increased the reserve potential in the Mid-Continent, which the company estimates at 3.5 tcfe, two and a half times its current reserves. As it expands its downspacing, pad drilling efforts and continues to tweak at efficiencies, results in the Mid-Continent should continue to improve. The same applies to the Permian. Exploration of the Permian is still in its early days. As management refines its efforts, starts pad drilling, and reduces well spacing, costs should come down, and estimates of recoverable resource should increase -- tactics successfully employed by Permian veteran Apache ( NYSE:APA ) .

Oil & Lubes Shell plays down risk of stranded oil and gas reserves The disclosure is a rare admission by a major oil and gas company that some of its reserves may be worthless in a world shifting to renewable energy from fossil fuels in an effort to stem global warming Reuters April 15, 2021, 20:14 IST LONDON: Royal Dutch Shellsaid on Thursday the majority of its oil and gas reserves will be produced by 2050, playing down the risk of stranded assets as it prepares to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades. The disclosure is a rare admission by a major oil and gas company that some of its reserves may be worthless in a world shifting to renewable energy from fossil fuels in an effort to stem global warming. The Anglo-Dutch company said in a document to investors summarising its climate strategy that around 75 per cent of its proved oil and gas reserves will be produced by 2030, with an additional 3 per cent produced after 2040. Since late 2019, Shellhas wiped out over $20 billion from the value of its oil and gas reserves after lowering the outlook for commodity prices because of the energy transition and the impact on demand of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shell had just over 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved oil and gas reserves last year, the equivalent of around 7 years of its 2020 production, its annual report said. Shell aims to cut its emissions from well-head to petrol station to net zero by 2050, and has set out intermediate targets, in one of the sector's most ambitious plans. With this latest important step in Shell's transition from an oil and gas producer to be an energy company, a multi-decadal transition is clearly underway. Adam Matthews Director of Ethics & Engagement, Church of England Pensions Board The company said it will focus on hydrogen, biofuels and offshore wind as well as carbon-sucking technologies and planting trees, but it has yet to outline exact plans for reaching the target. Its annual spending is however set to stay focused on oil and gas in the coming years. Shell, the world's largest oil and gas trader, said it sells around 4.6 per cent of energy consumed in the world and produces around 1.4 per cent of total primary energy. Chief Executive Ben van Beurdensaid the net-zero strategy is ""fully consistent"" with the more stringent U.N.-backed goal set in a 2015 Paris conference to limit global warming. But climate activists and research groups have criticised plans to allow the use of carbon offsets to permit oil and gas reserves to be drained. The Anglo-Dutch company said it will put its energy transition strategy to a non-binding vote at its annual general meeting in May, an unprecedented move for oil and gas companies, said Adam Matthews, Director of Ethics &amp; Engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, who has led investor engagement with Shell. ""With this latest important step in Shell's transition from an oil and gas producer to be an energy company, a multi-decadal transition is clearly underway,"" Matthews said in a statement. Shell, however, urged investors to vote against a resolution filed by activist group Follow This calling on the company to set a target on the absolute reduction of carbon emissions.

Kinder Morgan Energy Partners' distribution, meanwhile, has seen a double-digit compound annual growth rate over the past decade, powered by consistent distribution increases. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners' yield is around 6.6% versus Enterprise's 4.4%. Enterprise has grown its business much more quickly, leading to a premium valuation. Revenues, for example, have grown from nearly $22 billion in 2003 to $42.5 billion last year. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners' top line fell over the same span. Note, too, that Enterprise bought its general partner in 2010, so it avoids the general partner incentive payments that Kinder Morgan Energy Partners has to make. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Enterprise are very similar entities. Investors should feel comfortable with either, though it's worth highlighting that Kinder Morgan Energy Partners' accounting methods have been questioned by a niche research shop, which is likely presenting a short-term buying opportunity . The supplier Another way to play the trend is Hi-Crush Partners ( NYSE:HCLP ) , a pure-play frac sand miner. This material is vital to the fracking drilling method. Hi-Crush's premium white sand is a high-quality offering that is gaining share within the proppant market. And the company benefits from on site distribution capabilities at its two mines, helping to keep its costs low. The units yield around 8.8%, which is pretty high and speaks to a lack of diversification. Where Kinder has oil and gas pipelines, shipping terminals, and storage facilities, Hi-Crush just has sand. That said, Hi-Crush recently grew its business via an acquisition and intends to increase its distribution in the fourth quarter. That would be the first hike for this young partnership but is a statement to its underlying strengths. And management is projecting increased pricing and demand for frac sand through the end of the decade. The drillers If you are looking specifically for a driller, however, Vanguard Natural Resources ( NASDAQOTH:VNRSQ ) is a good option. About 60% of the company's production is natural gas, with the rest coming from oil and NGLs. Its goal is to further diversify its portfolio, bringing natural gas down below 50%. Still, it will be a direct beneficiary of increased natural gas use and foreign oil displacement, and it offers an around 8.8% yield. The distribution has been increased each year since 2007 as Vanguard has expanded its business via acquisition. If you are more aggressive, Linn Energy ( NASDAQOTH:LINEQ ) might be of interest. The units yield over 11% and trade under the cloud of an informal SEC inquiry into its accounting practices that could have an impact on its acquisition of Berry Petroleum. That said, the company is working on the issue with the government and the outlook isn't as negative as it once was, though there is still little available information. And despite the problems, Linn has built itself into the 11 th largest independent oil and gas driller in the country. The partnership's has focused on buying mature properties and running them well. And it locks in prices for its output via an active, and so far largely successful, hedging program. Both of these attributes provide notable clarity to the company's ability to pay distributions. About half of Linn's reserves are natural gas. Although there's clearly more business risk here right now, the additional yield might be worth it for aggressive types. Oil, gas, and yield If you are watching the energy revolution taking place in the United States and want to participate, but also want to ""get paid,"" these five partnerships are good options. Their risk profiles and direct exposure to gas and oil differ, so they aren't right for every investor. But each one of these high yielders is positioned to continue exploiting the fracking boom.

There, Joel interviewed Clara Mata, an advanced product development specialist, and Jeff Lavers, vice president and general manager of 3M oil and gas. While most consumers think of tape and office supplies when they hear 3M, the company has expanded in many industries within recent years that might have investors salivating. In 2012, 3M developed the Mining, Oil, and Gas solutions division that showcases products available to the industry and applies new technologies to protect critical assets and workers and increase productivity. In the interview, Joel investigates some of the applications of a new 3M innovation -- that of glass bubbles. While glass bubbles have helped in many industries, Mata focuses on how 3M can apply this technology in cementing wells and drilling muds. Lavers explores how 3M has differentiated itself in glass bubbles because of the company's ability to control and extend the innovation. Joel South has no position in any stocks mentioned.

870,It's Not Just Low Oil Prices That Are Hurting Energy Companies... -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 13:05:00,"Energy results are as diverse as the industry itself, and we are here to dissect what drove these numbers. NYSE:ESV ) , are contracting work at bargain prices to stay afloat in the ocean, rather than dry in the docks, but they're not being rented out by companies we're used to seeing in the sector. And natural gas is still at the bottom, leaving investors wondering which outlook should be considered when trying to predict the market's next move for oil and gas. Fool analysts Sean O'Reilly and Tyler Crowe discussed this and what it means for the energy sector. Listen to the full podcast by clicking here A full transcript follows the video. Sean O'Reilly: Are there any trends in the energy industry itself that you noticed this quarter? Tyler Crowe: One of the trends that I was very surprised with -- maybe not completely surprised, but a little more of a greater reaction than I would have though -- you're seeing a lot of rig companies like Transocean, Diamond Offshore and companies like those that have been taking on contracts for rigs. That sounds great, but if you look at the rates at which they're taking them, they are at bargain basement prices. O'Reilly: Who is doing this? Crowe: You're getting some exploration and production companies -- not necessarily your big oil companies -- some of the smaller, independent oil producers that are mostly outside of the United States. Guys like Tullow Oil, which is a British Company, Dana Petroleum and things like that. They're taking a flyer on these super cheap rigs. To give an example, Ensco last quarter had a couple jack up rigs, which working in the North Sea will normally generate $135,000 a day. That's been the average for a jack up rig in the area. This past quarter they took on contracts for $50,000 a day. The idea is that they're just going to keep them working to a certain degree rather than keeping them stacked and paying out money. At least in this way, you can more or less break even. O'Reilly: Are they at least servicing debts and depreciation with this $50,000 a day? Crowe: I think it's not necessarily servicing anything other than preventing from having to pay the costs of keeping it stacked in the yard. There are costs associated with these things not at work. So just getting a contract to keep them working and not have to pay those is slightly beneficial. What it kind of showed me when I saw these was that these companies are really bracing for a longer downturn than they had originally expected or anticipated, even back in 2014 when you saw some companies saying it was going to get rough. Now we're a year in and they're still saying it could get a lot worse. Taylor Muckerman: Mine is short and sweet. Natural gas it's near a five year low right now. O'Reilly: It's crazy. Muckerman: It's just like oil. [crosstalk] Muckerman: No. the last I saw it was $1.80/$1.90. Crowe: That is the spot market price because a lot of companies like Chevron this past quarter, their realized natural gas price was $1.93. You're seeing a lot of exploration and production companies, in some cases, losing money on every BTU that they produce. O'Reilly: That's crazy. Muckerman: Natural gas is the future of power, it's the future of the chemical industry, and yet the price... Crowe: When it's that cheap it can be the future. O'Reilly: It's just crazy to think that it was $13 six years ago. Muckerman: 2012, wasn't it? O'Reilly: Yeah, even worse. Crowe: We saw bottoming in 2012 because there was a glut of rigs. It was actually very similar to what we're seeing today in oil, although it's taken a bit longer to clear. In 2012 we had where everyone was talking about natural gas and how great it was going to be and people were giving natural gas companies all the money in the world to go out and drill. Muckerman: Then they drilled too much. Crowe: Drilled too much. Low and behold. We're getting the same thing again today where there's too much gas and not enough demand, especially in the United States because we haven't seen a lot of those LNG facilities actually fire up. When those do, that's a lot of demand that's going to start to spark things up. Muckerman: We saw a spot price of almost $3 at the beginning of the quarter and now it's below $2. O'Reilly: What's been surprising to me over the last couple of months that the diversity of opinions within the oil and gas sector. I was thinking this the whole time when we were in Houston, Tyler. You've got guys like the CEO of Core Labs and a couple of gentlemen that we spoke to who are quite bullish. They're like ""This is silly. This is not going to last."" Then you have these rig companies and you have a couple of the majors that are like ""This is going to be lower for a long time."" You have BP saying it will be the end of the decade or something before oil recovers. Nobody actually knows what's going on, evidenced by the diversity of opinions. Crowe: You could consider it the ""hope for the best, plan for the worst"" situation. O'Reilly: I was like ""Are the rig guys and a lot of the majors saying it's going to go until 2018 or 2019 that oil is going to be below $50; is that them lowering expectations?"" Crowe: I'm sure there is a certain element to that. I would actually feel better with a management team that is bracing for the fact that it could last that long rather than one being like ""Hey! 2016, we're going to do great because everything is going to turn right around. Don't worry about it."" O'Reilly: Because you can't know that. Crowe: Exactly. Nobody knows. To be conservative today and position yourself to be ready when it actually does turn, I think, is a better place to be than to put it on snake eyes and see what happens.

871,Shell to Let Shareholders Vote on Shift to Cleaner Energy,wsj,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 13:05:00,"Oil giant seeks investor endorsement for its energy transition strategy LONDON Royal Dutch Shell PLC detailed a first-of-a-kind shareholder vote over its pivot away from oil, asking investors to endorse its energy transition strategy in a nonbinding vote next month. While environmental groups have long put forward climate-related resolutions at annual shareholder meetings, Shells move is the first by an oil major to set up a regular review of its progress in moving away from oil. The decision to offer shareholders a vote comes as energy companies face increasing investor pressure to map out their future in a lower-carbon economy, where oil and gas demand is forecast to fall, with the rollout of technologies such as electric cars and wind and solar power. Earlier this year, Exxon Mobil Corp. outlined plans for a low-carbon business unit after some shareholders argued it should focus more on investments in clean energy, while BP PLC has pledged to cut oil output by around 40% over the coming decade and invest more in renewable energy. Shell laid out plans in February to reduce its dependence on oil, saying it would cut output by 1%-2% a year, while boosting spending on low-carbon energy.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/shell-to-let-shareholders-vote-on-shift-to-cleaner-energy-11618491951
872,Just How Many Billions Will Be Spent on Oil and Natural Gas?  -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 13:00:00,"With energy exploration and production companies looking to ramp up activity in North American shale plays, global oil and gas spending is projected to grow by 6% next year. ) Dec 29, 2013 at 2:00PM While oil and gas spending grew only moderately this year, it is expected to increase significantly next year, as energy companies accelerate activity in the U.S., the Middle East, and Latin America. According to a recent report by Barclays, oil and gas companies will spend $723 billion next year on global exploration and production, up 6.1% from $682 billion this year, based on a recent survey of hundreds of oil and gas companies. Let's take a closer look at the key drivers of this anticipated spending growth. North American spending In North America, Barclays forecasts a more than 7% increase in upstream spending next year, up from a 2% increase this year. The projected growth will be driven by an increased focus on drilling, evaluation and completion activity in key U.S. resource plays, such as the Eagle Ford and Bakken. Over the past few years, dozens of major E&Ps have sold off foreign assets to focus on high-growth domestic plays. For instance, Devon Energy NYSE:DVN ) divested the vast majority of its international assets a few years ago to finance its North American drilling program, where it sees great opportunities in Texas' Permian Basin, the Mississippi-Woodford trend, and -- more recently -- the Eagle Ford, while Apache ( NYSE:APA ) recently sold a portion of its Egyptian oil and gas assets to focus on its ""growth core"" assets in the Permian Basin and Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin. Similarly, ConocoPhillips NYSE:COP ) dumped assets in Kazakhstan, Nigeria, and Algeria, generating $12.4 billion in proceeds since 2012 that will help finance a ramp up in drilling activity across its roughly 2 million acres in the Eagle Ford, Permian Basin, and the Bakken, while Occidental Petroleum ( NYSE:OXY ) is selling a stake in its Middle East assets to concentrate on the Permian Basin, where it accounts for nearly a fifth of total production. James West, Barclays' lead oil services and drilling analyst, added that well inventories in the U.S. are at their highest level ever, providing companies with plenty of drilling opportunities next year and in the years to come. Indeed, many of the above-mentioned companies have thousands of undrilled well locations in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Permian Basin. International spending Outside of North America, Barclays expects E&P spending to grow 6% to a record $524 billion next year, down from a 10% increase this year. Though activity is expected to remain robust in the Middle East, Latin America, and Russia, international E&P spending won't grow as much as it did this year due to reduced spending growth from the integrated oil majors and from Chinese national oil companies. Under pressure from shareholders, some of the integrated majors have scaled back their capital programs. For instance, Total ( NYSE:TOT ) recently said that its spending over the next few years will decline from an expected $28-$29 billion this year to a range of $24-$25 billion through 2017, while Chevron ( NYSE:CVX ) recently announced a 2014 capital budget of $39.8 billion, down $2.2 billion from this year's expected budget of $42 billion. Shareholder pressure has also led smaller players, like Chesapeake Energy ( NYSE:CHK ) , to reduce their spending dramatically. This year, the company expects to spend just $6.9 billion, which is less than half of its 2012 capital budget of $13.4 billion. In line with its strategy of boosting shareholder returns through unlocking value from its existing asset base, more than 80% of this year's capital budget went toward drilling and completion activities, up from an average of 50% over the period 2010-2012. The bottom line One of the reasons why North American oil and gas spending only grew by about 2% this year is because of energy producers' relatively conservative forecasts for commodity prices this year. They were expecting West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to average just $85 a barrel and U.S. benchmark natural gas to average roughly $3.50 per MMBtu, which led many to curtail gas drilling. But next year, companies are forecasting higher average prices of $89 per barrel for WTI and $3.66 per MMBtu for U.S. benchmark natural gas for next year, which provides greater incentive to ramp up drilling activity. All told, energy investors can expect an exciting year ahead. Fool contributor Arjun Sreekumarowns shares of Chesapeake Energy and Devon Energy. The Motley Fool recommends Chevron and Total SA.

873,"Woodside, Santos Investors Reject Oil and Gas Wind-up Resolution",hartenergy,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 12:55:00,"Almost one-fifth of votes cast ahead of Woodside Petroleums annual meeting and 13% of votesof Santoswere in favor of the resolution proposed by shareholder activist grouppushing the company to get out of oil and gas. Transactions Woodside, Santos Investors Reject Oil and Gas Wind-up Resolution Almost one-fifth of votes cast ahead of Woodside Petroleums annual meeting and 13% of votes of Santos were in favor of the resolution proposed by shareholder activist group pushing the company to get out of oil and gas. Sonali Paul, Reuters Thu, 04/15/2021 - 07:55 AM Your browser does not support the audio element. Investors in Australias top two independent oil and gas producers on April 14 rejected an activist groups push to get the companies to spell out plans to wind down their operations to help curb global warming. The resolutions were ultimately not put to a vote as they required shareholders first to approve a move to amend the companies constitutions, which they did not. However, their boards did disclose the proxy votes on the resolutions. Almost one-fifth of votes cast ahead of Woodside Petroleums annual meeting were in favor of the resolution proposed by shareholder activist group Market Forces, which is affiliated with Friends of the Earth Australia. That compared with 13% of votes cast ahead of Santos Ltd.s annual meeting in favor of pushing the company to get out of oil and gas. Market Forces had hoped for more backing as another group, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), last year won strong support for pushing companies to set targets for cutting their customers carbon emissions, so-called Scope 3 emissions. Whats disappointing is investors have missed that next step of understanding that reducing Scope 3 emissions means reducing coal, oil and gas production, Market Forces campaigner Will van de Pol said. He said, however, after the Santos vote: With todays vote almost doubling the previous record set for a fossil fuel wind-up resolution, all coal, oil and gas producers must take noteinvestors are increasingly willing to demand drastic action to align with global climate goals. Both Woodside and Santos see gas as a key fuel in the transition to cleaner energy, and as a source for hydrogen down the track. Woodside said its net emissions have peaked and will decline, barring any major new acquisitions. The point I want all shareholders to understand is we think Woodside prospers in a lower carbon world, Woodside Chairman Richard Goyder told shareholders at the annual meeting in Perth. In contrast to Europes oil majors, the leading Australian gas producers are not chasing renewable energy, but instead focusing on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and tree-planting to offset emissions. Hydrogen with CCS will ultimately eliminate our emissions, and thats our plan, Santos Chairman Keith Spence told shareholders. Santos and Woodside also initially faced climate resolutions from ACCR, working with British hedge fund manager Chris Hohns Say on Climate campaign. Those were withdrawn after both companies agreed to put their climate reporting to a vote at their annual meetings in 2022.",https://www.hartenergy.com/exclusives/woodside-santos-investors-reject-oil-and-gas-wind-resolution-193548
874,Stronger climate policies promise 'profound change' for oil and gas sector,nsenergybusiness,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 11:33:30,"Research from WoodMackenzie urges oil and gas companies to avoid complacency as global policymakers weigh stronger action on climate change. 15 Apr 2021 Research from WoodMackenzie urges oil and gas companies to avoid complacency as world leaders weigh stronger action on climate change that could transform market fundamentals World leaders are stepping up their efforts to advance progress towards the Paris Agreement (Credit: Oaklizm/Shutterstock) The oil and gas industry cannot afford to be complacent in its approach to the energy transition, and delayed action is not a sustainable corporate strategy in a scenario where decisive policy action is taken to address climate change. New analysisfrom consultancy WoodMackenzie suggests the risks to the sector associated with strengthened climate policies and rapidly-changing technologies are too great to ignore, with the key fundamentals of supply, demand and pricing poised for a profound change. For oil producers in particular, the prospect of a shrinking market as its products are phased out of the energy mix is one that needs to be taken seriously, with severe challenges ahead for both international and national oil companies. No oil company is prepared for the scale of change envisioned, the group said of its assessment of how the market might evolve if policymakers take decisive action to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. In the scenario, all companies face a decline, and the sector sees asset impairments and bankruptcy or restructuring on a scale far greater than that of 2020 it added. Our scenario would see the end of Big Oil and the rise of Big Energy. Shifting landscape for oil and gas companies as countries step up climate change commitments WoodMackenzie caveats that its analysis reflects one interpretation of how the energy system might change under stronger Paris-aligned policies, based on its fundamental analysis across the natural resource sectors. Nevertheless, global momentum to introduce tougher climate goals is undoubtedly gathering pace, boosted by the US return to the Paris Agreement under President Biden, who has made climate change a priority issueof both domestic and foreign policy. The White House will host a virtual summit of world leaders next week aimed at stimulating global action to reduce carbon emissions, at which it is reportedlyset to announce an upgraded 50% emissions-reduction target for 2030. China has already set in motion plans peak its emissions before 2030 and to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2060 while the European Union is targeting a 55% emissions reduction by 2030 on its path to net-zero by mid-century. The COP26 climate summit, being held in the UK later this year, is hoped to further advance international commitments to advance the low-carbon energy transition. If the world acts decisively to limit global warming to 2C by 2050, the scale of change will revolutionise the energy industry, WoodMackenzie said. Progressive electrification will squeeze the most polluting hydrocarbons out of the energy mix, nearly eliminating their markets. Oil demand will shrink and with it, so will the power of major oil producers. Gas demand will remain resilient, but business models will need to evolve. Ann-Louise Hittle, WoodMackenzies vice president for macro oils, added: The oil and gas industry cannot afford to be complacent  the risks associated with robust climate-change policy and rapidly-changing technology are too great. Brent crude could fall to $40 per barrel by 2030 In its forecast, the energy researcher said oil demand could drop significantly over the coming years, and with it so too would oil prices enter long-term decline. By 2030, it expects Brent crude to average $40 per barrel  compared to around $60-70 per barrel at present  and to slide to as low as $10-18 per barrel by 2050. The steep fall in demand prevents those key oil producers [namely Opec] from managing the market and supporting prices in the way it does today, the group said. Despite losing their price-setting ability, however, low-cost Middle East Opec producers remain core providers of oil. The influential oil-exporter group, led by Saudi Arabia, will hold a roughly 50% market share by mid-century, it added, but will exert less control over a downsized market. For the financially strong integrated international oil majors, dwindling revenues from their upstream operations will prompt higher investments in new technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen, and renewable energy sources. Some of the majors, including BP, Shell and Total, have already begun making inroadsinto these new businesses, and WoodMackenzie suggests they could enjoy a potential early-mover advantage in the nascent hydrogen market, and become leaders in the development of CCS. The tantalising hope of a few more years of windfall cash flows may lead some IOCs and NOCs to defer action, but delay will not be a sustainable corporate strategy the consultancy warned. Gas and LNG demand resilient, but business models will need to change While oil is expected to enter structural decline in a scenario of strengthened global climate policy, demand for gas will remain resilient, with capital investments gradually shifting to natural gas and LNG supplies as the fuel begins trading at a premium to oil. The price outlook for gas under AET-2 [the accelerated energy transition scenario] remains firm, said WoodMackenzies vice president for global gas and LNG, Massimo Di-Odoardo. In North America, low oil prices lead to reduced tight oil production cutting into the availability of cheap associated gas. Greater volumes of expensive dry gas are needed to meet gas demand. Our analysis shows Henry Hub prices trading at $3-4 per thousand cubic feet. In the global LNG market, resilient Asian gas demand leads to reliance on 290 million tonnes per annum of pre-final investment decision LNG supply, including higher-cost US LNG. As a result, LNG prices jump to $8-9 per million British thermal units (Btu) by 2040. It is not until after 2040, when global gas demand begins to ease, that Henry Hub and LNG prices start softening due to increased competition of supply. In the scenario, an estimated $330bn will be required to support the necessary growth in global LNG capacity and a further $700bn to support dry gas development in North America. Yet despite this resilience of gas markets, business models will need to change to maintain margins and attract capital in a world of stricter carbon policies. Gas and LNG sellers will need to focus on low-cost, low-carbon supply and Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide emission reductions as carbon prices increase, said Di-Odoardo. The management of Scope 3 carbon emissions through CCS will need to become a part of integrated gas and LNG sales strategies. Do you have interesting content to share with us?

The Two horizontal pump jacks operated by Occidental Petroleum on Mark Schells 310 acre farm in Longmont Colorado Sept. 02, 2020. By Dan Mika| April 15, 2021 at 5:00 a.m. FORT COLLINS  The Larimer County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved an extension of the countys temporary ban on new applications for oil and gas operations for the next five months. The vote taken during the commissioners Tuesday afternoon meeting sets the moratorium on new drilling to expire on Sept. 15, while a related halt to new 1041 land-use applications was extended through Dec. 15. 1041 refers to a portion of Senate Bill 181, the sweeping energy production reforms that were passed into law in the summer of 2019. Under the law, local governments can add stricter regulations on oil and gas operations than the statewide level or implement their own reviews on drilling applications. The commissioners first voted to implement the moratorium in mid-March so it could consider changing local rules to conform with a new set of regulations instituted by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission that took effect in January of this year. The most-prominent new rule from that set of regulations is a 2,000-foot setback between any new well and a school, home or sensitive wildlife habitat, which energy industry proponents blasted as overly restrictive. Commissioner Kristin Stephens said the group has no intention of continuing to extend the moratorium indefinitely and believes that the moratorium will give the county a chance to set definitive rules on what can and cant be done by the industry. There are a couple of reasons why were looking at these, but politics is not part of a part of that, she said. Its really about listening to folks in our community. In a statement, American Petroleum Institute Colorado executive director Lynn Granger argued that theres no basis for a moratorium of any length to be implemented.

That can cause investors who missed the scoop to lose precious profits down the road. In this case, there are two news items over the past month that I don't think the investing community has really grasped a hold of just yet. If missed, these trends could prove costly for investors. Photo credit: . No. 1: Fracking is safer than once thought A landmark study by the Department of Energy shows that there is no evidence the chemicals from fracking contaminate drinking water aquifers. After a year of monitoring, the study has found that fracking chemicals stayed thousands of feet below the areas that supply drinking water. In fact, drilling fluids that were tagged with unique markers and injected 8,000 feet underground were not detected in zones that were monitored 3,000 feet higher. This means that fracking fluids stayed nearly a mile away from drinking water. This study is really great news for the oil and gas industry. However, it gets even better as technological advances by Halliburton ( NYSE:HAL ) are virtually eliminating much of the concerns over fracking fluid and the industry's freshwater usage. The company has developed a fracking fluid based on ingredients found in the food industry. Further, the company is in the process of rolling out a produced water recycling system that would recycle wastewater onsite. It has recently partnered with Nuverra Environmental Solutions ( NASDAQOTH:NESC ) to move forwarda roll out of the system in the Bakken shale. The system would not only save millions of gallons of fresh water and hundreds of thousands of truck trips, but it would also save money. With fracking being much safer than once thought, it means the oil and gas industry won't be slowing down anytime soon. No. 2: The winners of America's oil advantage have changed Skyrocketing oil production over the past few years has caused its share of problems. Most notably, there simply isn't enough infrastructure in the country to get the oil from where it's produced to refineries. This reality caused a real glut of oil at our nation's storage depots, which had a negative effect on oil prices. In fact, U.S.-produced oil was $20 cheaper than oil produced elsewhere this past February. As a result, there's been an explosion in oilbeing transported by rail as refiners want to buy this cheaper crude oil. However, having additional pipeline capacity come online, when combined with all the crude oil hitting the rails, has caused the spread between globally traded Brent and U.S. benchmarked WTI to shrink to less than a dollar this week. This trend has hit refiners such as Valero ( NYSE:VLO ) hard. This past quarter the company reported an operating income drop of 42% over last year's totals, as its margins were affected by higher oil prices. On the other hand, oil producers such as Bakken-focused Continental Resources ( NYSE:CLR ) are poised to thrive this quarter, as the company can now get more for every barrel of oil it produces. That's one reason investors had bid its shares up an all-time high this week. The company could potentially produce a blowout quarter when it reports on Aug 7. Final Foolish thoughts One thing is quite clear: Fracking is here to stay, and with it increased oil and gas production. With oil prices high, this is creating quite the profit potential for investors. Unfortunately, too many investors may miss out.

878,"Why ConocoPhillips Will Pump Out Lots of Oil, Gas, and Dividends in 2014 and Beyond -- The Motley Fool",fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 10:01:00,"ConocoPhillips' focus on the most promising oil and gas producing regions of the United States means shareholders will win big. , and its midstream master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners LP ( NYSE:PSXP ) , ConocoPhillips is now an exclusively independent oil and gas exploration and production company. It advises investors to expect strong long-term growth as a result of its key geographic focus, particularly in North America, and it's hard to argue with management's confidence. Geographic focus is a winning strategy ConocoPhillips no longer has a diversified business model after releasing its refining and midstream assets over the past couple of years. Now that Phillips 66 and Phillips 66 Partners are publicly traded entities all on their own, ConocoPhillips can't afford to make ill-advised upstream investments that don't pan out. That makes finding the best oil and gas production opportunities absolutely imperative, and fortunately for investors, ConocoPhillips has a management team that is more than up to the task. In the United States, ConocoPhillips has set its sights on a select few regions that should produce years of strong growth. To paraphrase the company's own words, ConocoPhillips maintains a diverse asset base with scope and scale, and is positioned in key resource trends. Its major areas of investment in the United States include the Permian Basin, Bakken shale, and Eagle Ford plays. An understanding of the massive potential of these areas reveals ConocoPhillips' promising future ahead. The Permian Basin is located in West Texas and eastern New Mexico. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that total production at the Permian Basin hit one million barrels per day in 2011, making the region one of the select few in the United States to reach that level of daily production. ConocoPhillips plans $3 billion worth of investments in the Permian Basin, which should add 40,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day to its production totals by 2017. The Energy Information Information's findings of the Eagle Ford formation are equally impressive. Total production at Eagle Ford reached 1 million barrels per day in August, and is poised to grow even further in the months ahead. The rapid acceleration of production is astounding, since Eagle Ford did not even have significant oil drilling until just three years ago. The Eagle Ford formation represents ConocoPhillips' biggest locale of the three in terms of total investment. The company will spend $8 billion over five years to produce 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2017. Production growth should reach 16% compounded annually over that time frame. Meanwhile, the EIA reports that the Bakken region now accounts for a little over 10% of total U.S. oil production, and is expected to reach the 1 million barrel per day marker very soon. Interestingly, the government finds that rig counts have actually declined in the Bakken field, but soaring output per rig is what accounts for the increase in total production. ConocoPhillips' operations in the Bakken area include 626 million net acres that hold more than 1,400 identified drilling locations. ConocoPhillips is allocating $4 billion to the region over a five-year time frame, where production will grow by 18% compounded annually through 2017. More than enough production to fuel ConocoPhillips' dividend ConocoPhillips takes its capital allocation program very seriously. It prides itself on having the highest dividend yield of any independent exploration and production company in its direct peer group. To fund its hefty payout, it's critical for ConocoPhillips to focus only on the best production opportunities going forward. The company considers its dividend to be its highest priority use of cash flow. As a result, investors can take comfort in knowing how seriously management takes its commitment to returning cash to shareholders. And, thanks to its focus on the geographic areas of the United States that hold the highest potential, which include the Permian, Bakken, and Eagle Ford plays, ConocoPhillips will be able to keep pumping out strong dividends for many years to come.

879,Oil and Natural Gas Might Pay for Your Child's Education -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 09:33:00,"Surging oil and natural gas production has Texas rainy day fund filled to the brim. NYSE:APA ) have been leading the charge. Thanks to the success of these companies, the Lone Star State's rainy day fund has never been richer. In fact, the pot that is more formally known as the Economic Stabilization Fund now holds more than $14 billion. It is only expected to grow bigger in the future thanks to taxes from increased production. This past year the state collected a record $4.3 billion in severance taxes from oil and gas development, of which $2.5 billion will be deposited in the bailout fund per state law. If predictions from state Railroad Commission Chairman Barry Smitherman prove true, annual deposits to the fund could eventually surpass $6 billion per year. That's because he sees oil and gas production in the state tripling as drilling permit applications rise to levels not seen in nearly 30 years. Production gusher One of the companies fueling the recent rise in Texas' oil production is EOG Resources, which is the largest producer in the Eagle Ford shale. It doesn't see oil production slowing down either. Instead, EOG anticipates best-in-class oil production growth through 2017 as it continues to develop the Eagle Ford, as well as its emerging opportunities in the Delaware Basin. At its current rate, EOG Resources has more than a dozen years' worth of drilling inventory in the Eagle Ford and decades more in the Delaware Basin. Apache tells a similar story of future production growth. It's currently the No. 1 driller in the Permian Basin, but it sees an even more impressive future out of that play. One of the reasons for this is its vast reserve potential. Apache has proven reserves of 812 million barrels of oil equivalent. However, it estimates additional unproven resources upward of 4.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This has led Apache to increase its investment in the play, up sixfold since 2010 alone. As Apache continues to grow production some of that cash flow will to spill into Texas' rainy day fund. Anadarko Petroleum also has made a big impact on Texas' oil and gas production, as well as its stabilization fund. This year alone the company will drill more than 500 wells in the state, in locations including the Eagle Ford, Permian Basin, and East Texas. In the Eagle Ford alone Anadarko has grown sales by a 100% compound annual rate since 2009. While its rate is likely to slow over time, that's only due to the law of large numbers as Anadarko still has more than 2,500 identified future drilling sites in that single play. Bottom line, Anadarko Petroleum will continue to fill Texas' coffers for years to come. More states swimming in oil and natural gas cash Texas isn't the only state swimming in cash thanks to oil and gas production. North Dakota's economy has been riding the incredible coattails of the Bakken shale In that state, the average well from a producer like EOG Resources will pay $4.3 million in taxes over its lifetime. That's flooding the state's newly created North Dakota Legacy Trust Fund with in excess of $1.3 billion in cash -- more than double the fund's original target for this point in its life. North Dakota's plan is to let its cash build up until June 2017, when lawmakers are allowed to begin making withdraws for areas such as education. A number of other states have set up funds with excess oil and gas taxes. New Mexico, for example, has an $11 billion Severance Tax Permanent Fund that it uses to pay down the interest and the principle on the bonds that it issues. Wyoming has a $6 billion fund that it uses primarily for scholarships. Finally, Alaska uses its massive $45 billion Permanent Fund to give residents a cash dividend each year. Last year, that amounted to $878 per person. With so many other states swimming in debt, oil and gas really has set these states up for success. Final thoughts America's energy boom has the potential to fuel the budgets of a number of states for the foreseeable future. Texas is in an especially solid position as it has both the Eagle Ford shale and the Permian Basin, which show no signs of turning off the spigot to its rainy day fund. It's a luxury few other states currently enjoy. How you can profit from America's energy boom Fool contributor Matt DiLallohas no position in any stocks mentioned.

880,2 Oil & Gas Projects Even Environmentalists Would Like -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 09:03:00,"The energy industry really does take its commitment to the environment seriously. NYSE:CVX ) is spending $2 billion on the world's largest carbon dioxide injection facility. The project will store over 3 million tonnes per year in a saline aquifer. It's part of the company's massive Gorgon LNG project in Australia. Because the raw gas produced out of the Gorgon field contains about 14% carbon dioxide, Chevron needs to separate and safely dispose of it before it can purify, liquefy and sell the methane to world markets. It's one of the most ambitious carbon capture and sequestration projects in the world and could become a global template for future carbon capture and storage projects. Another company with a unique spin on carbon capture and storage is Denbury Resources ( NYSE:DNR ) . The oil company has secured carbon dioxide from a number of industrial sources, which it's using to enhance oil recovery. So, instead of injecting the carbon dioxide into an aquifer, Denbury is injecting it into a mature oil field in an effort to push more oil out of the reservoir. Overall, the company has six projects either currently producing or proposed, which will supply it with a portion the carbon dioxide it needs to capture more oil out of these fields. Final Foolish Thoughts The energy industry and the environment really can live in harmony. That's because the industry is making great strides to reduce the amount of freshwater it uses as well as providing solutions to curb carbon emissions. It's a good thing too, because right now the world is craving energy and we need these companies to continue producing at high levels. Looking for More Forward Thinking Energy Companies?

Woodside, Santos investors reject activist's oil, gas wind-up resolution By Sonali Paul 3 Min Read MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Investors in Australias top two independent oil and gas producers on Thursday rejected an activist groups push to get the companies to spell out plans to wind down their operations to help curb global warming. FILE PHOTO: The logo for Woodside Petroleum is seen on a promotional poster on display at a briefing for investors in Sydney, Australia, May 23, 2018.   REUTERS/David Gray The resolutions were ultimately not put to a vote as they required shareholders first to approve a move to amend the companies constitutions, which they did not. However, their boards did disclose the proxy votes on the resolutions. Almost one-fifth of votes cast ahead of Woodside Petroleums annual meeting were in favour of the resolution proposed by shareholder activist group Market Forces, which is affiliated with Friends of the Earth Australia. That compared with 13% of votes cast ahead of Santos Ltds annual meeting in favour of pushing the company to get out of oil and gas. Market Forces had hoped for more backing as another group, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), last year won strong support for pushing companies to set targets for cutting their customers carbon emissions, so-called Scope 3 emissions. Whats disappointing is investors have missed that next step of understanding that reducing Scope 3 emissions means reducing coal, oil and gas production, Market Forces campaigner Will van de Pol said. He said however, after the Santos vote: With todays vote almost doubling the previous record set for a fossil fuel wind-up resolution, all coal, oil and gas producers must take note - investors are increasingly willing to demand drastic action to align with global climate goals. Both Woodside and Santos see gas as a key fuel in the transition to cleaner energy, and as a source for hydrogen down the track. Woodside said its net emissions have peaked and will decline, barring any major new acquisitions. The point I want all shareholders to understand is we think Woodside prospers in a lower carbon world, Woodside Chairman Richard Goyder told shareholders at the annual meeting in Perth. In contrast to Europes oil majors, the leading Australian gas producers are not chasing renewable energy, but instead focusing on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and tree-planting to offset emissions. Hydrogen with CCS will ultimately eliminate our emissions, and thats our plan, Santos Chairman Keith Spence told shareholders. Santos and Woodside also initially faced climate resolutions from ACCR, working with British hedge fund manager Chris Hohns Say on Climate campaign. Those were withdrawn after both companies agreed to put their climate reporting to a vote at their annual meetings in 2022.

882,The Biggest Risk Facing Kodiak Oil & Gas  -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 08:47:00,"A closer look at the biggest risk this Bakken-focused oil and gas junior faces. ) . However, while the play has already yielded tremendous quantities of oil, operating costs are exorbitantly high. This year, the average cost to drill and complete a well was roughly $10.5 billion, though recent evidence suggests costs are gradually trending down. Still, well costs in the Bakken remain almost twice as much as costs in conventional plays, like the Mississippi Lime, for instance. In addition to new technologies and generally favorable government policies, there is one crucial factor that has helped sustain America's energy boom  high oil prices. If oil prices, which are primarily driven by global supply and demand, see a sustained collapse, it would spell trouble for energy companies that rely primarily on oil revenue. Kodiak is one such company. To explore Kodiak's vulnerability to a sharp decline in oil prices, as well as numerous other crucial factors affecting its future, I created a premium research reporton the company. Hopefully, the report should help investors get a better picture of the company's future. It includes opportunities, major risks, crucial areas to watch, and a closer look at the company's management. The following is an excerpt from the report that addresses the biggest risk Kodiak faces and measures it has taken to alleviate such a risk. It's just a sample of one section, but I hope you find it useful. Risks to Monitor A sustained decline in oil prices is by far the biggest risk Kodiak faces. Market prices for oil and other commodities are highly volatile and will continue to be volatile in the future. At oil prices above $90 a barrel, Kodiak's wells are highly economical. But if prices were to dip below $70 a barrel, they would become significantly less profitable. However, besides its active hedging program, an additional advantage that Kodiak has is its staggered rig termination schedule, which offers a great deal of flexibility in quickly reducing its rig count. While the company is currently operating eight rigs, its rig count going forward will be largely determined by oil prices and well economics. For example, if oil prices plunge due to any number of macroeconomic shocks, Kodiak should be able to reduce its operated rig count significantly in a matter of months without having to foot the bill for termination fees. Regulatory and environmental risks come part and parcel with investing in oil and gas producers. Most of these are related to rules governing hydraulic fracturing. Two specific regulatory matters from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Land Management that Kodiak addressed involve new requirements for installing new equipment in an attempt to control emissions and increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing on public lands. These regulations may lead to operational delays or higher operating costs. Interested in other opportunities and risks facing Kodiak? That was just a sample of our new premium report on Kodiak Oil & Gas. If you're debating whether the company is a buy or sell the report may prove to be a crucial resource. In addition to an analysis of Kodiak's risks, areas to watch, and management, the report comes with complementary updates and delves into upside and downside catalysts looming on the horizon.

883,This $64 Billion Oil Company Is Setting a New Course by Investing in Wind Energy -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 08:45:00,"Can an oil company really have a comparative advantage in alternative energy? NYSE:XOM ) own solar energy research in the late 1980's, when the company concluded that solar's costliness wouldn't make it competitive until around 2012 . ExxonMobil Corporation subsequently sold its solar assets, waiting for the day when alternative energies might better compare with its oil offerings. Around 25 years later, it seems the time has come for oil companies to be increasingly interested in alternative investments. While the solar energy market has independently expanded thanks to utilities and pure play solar corporations, oil corporations may still have a comparative advantage opportunity in another alternative energy: floating offshore wind. Location: Flotation? Earlier this month, Norway-based Statoil ASA ( ) received official approval to build the world's first floating wind farm off the Scottish coast . Floating wind farms aren't a new idea, but taking them to market is. For the past six years, Statoil ASA has been analyzing and tweaking a single-turbine demo project it built off the coast of Norway . The lessons Statoil learned have helped it cut costs for this latest project by around 65 %. The new $230 million five -turbine farm will be capable of generating 30 MW of electricity, enough to power around 20,000 homes . ""Our objective with the Hywind pilot park is to demonstrate the feasibility of future commercial, utility-scale floating wind farms,"" said Irene Rummelhoff, Statoil's executive vice president for New Energy Solutions, in a statement. ""This will further increase the global market potential for offshore wind energy, contributing to realising our ambition of profitable growth in renewable energy and other low-carbon solutions ."" Unlike many other renewable energy projects by oil corporations, this is more than a positive publicity stunt. Statoil and other offshore oil companies have a unique competitive advantage when it comes to offshore wind. No other industry has the experience or the infrastructure to float a 140 -ton metal structure 15 miles off a coastline in depths exceeding 100 meters. Statoil plans to prove that it can do just that when this project's production kicks off in 2017 . Complementary Competition For Statoil, this isn't an isolated initiative. In May, the corporation announced the creation of a ""New Energy Solutions"" business unit, a division devoted to exploring renewable energy opportunities that complement its oil and gas portfolio. For example, Statoil recently joined forces with ExxonMobil Corporation and other oil companies to take offshore wind compatabilty to the next level. This joint-industry project is exploring the feasibility of installing floating wind turbines next to offshore oil platforms to help power their water-injection systems . Ironic or not, this symbiotic setup is a win-win for oil companies to cut extraction costs and expand their offshore wind understanding. Statoil isn't exiting oil yetbut it's embracing its comparative advantage to explore new energy opportunities elsewhere. Projects like this one serve as smart signals to investors that diversification and progressive profit trump conservative notions that sticking with the status quo is the only way to go. Exploring offshore floating wind opportunities makes sense for Statoil and other oil companies. And if it can turn that sense into profitable projects, investors will be rewarded for their oil stocks' smart moves.

884,What Mexico's Oil Reform Means for International Energy Companies -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 08:34:00,"Mexico's energy policy is on the brink of historic and much-needed change, much to the chagrin of some in Congress. Will the reform be enough to lift the country's energy industry and broader economy out of the doldrums? Dec 19, 2013 at 9:34AM If you thought Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was outrageous when he read Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham on the Senate floor as part of his protest against Obamacare, head south of the border. In Mexico, Congressman Antonio Garcia Conejo took it to another level when he stripped down to his skivvies in opposition of the country opening its doors to private investment into energy projects. He lambasted officials who support the measure, suggesting it was shameful to allow foreign investment into a region that billionaire investor Carlos Slim calls home. Slim is known for his telecom prowess, but in recent weeks rumors surfaced that Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, Mexico's state-run oil company, was trying to persuade him to up his stake in Repsol, Spain's oil and gas giant, to 10%. Reports, which were originally published in ABC newspaper, said Pemex officials were then looking to Slim to engineer a Pemex/Repsol partnership. Those rumors were eventually squashed, and while there were talks unfolding among Mexican, Argentinian, and Spanish oil execs, Slim wasn't named among them despite the fact that he's widely expected to participate in Mexico's new competitive energy market. Something Pemex can't deny is that it has been the poster child of Mexico's failed energy policy, and with that the responsibility for a lagging economy. The Pemex monopoly has had a grip on Mexico's energy industry for almost a century, but has failed to provide adequate investment to capitalize on the country's vast energy resources. If things don't change, Mexico will go from being one of the world's greatest exporters of oil to a net importer of the commodity before the decade is done. This past weekend Pemex's grip was loosened when the majority of state legislators passed the energy reform bill to usher private investment into Mexico's economy. Paving the way Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in July called for investment of $315 billion in the 2013-2018 period into the country's infrastructure, including energy assets via public-private partnerships. Indeed it was vital for Mexico to change its constitution to support foreign investment into the energy sector for this to materialize and provide the supply to meet the rising demand in segments of Mexico's economy such as manufacturing. For the past 75 years international oil companies have been sidelined from participating in energy production, and in the meantime Mexico's economy has paid for it. It makes little sense, as Mexico's energy resources are comparable to those found in the Middle East, yet the country has been facing natural-gas shortages and importing liquefied natural gas from Africa amid an infrastructure fail. All of this has been blamed for slow economic growth in the region. To his credit President Nieto seems to have turned the tide during his first year in office. In a Platts article, however, Energia's George Baker suggested that while Mexico's energy reform makes for good headlines it misses on execution. The bold step would have been to have announced an IPO for a Pemex 2.0, a mixed capital company with open shares in the NYSE. It would be this company that would enter into [joint ventures] with foreign oil companies in Mexico and beyond. Mexico's economy has been crippled by declining direct foreign investments, which were slashed nearly in half in 2012 compared with the 10-year average, according to The Economist. Part of the decline was a consequence of Banco Santander's ( NYSE:SAN ) decision to spin off its Mexican unit in a deal that raised $4 billion. Perhaps Mexico should reconsider Baker's IPO idea. Conclusion Sen. Cruz's rendition of a Dr. Seuss classic drummed up some attention, but did little to change the outcome of the policy he was so dramatically fighting against. In Mexico's case, it appears the rhetoric surrounding the pending reform won't interfere with the much-needed private capital making its way to where it's needed, in a floundering energy industry and the broader regional economy.

885,The Price of Oil Can Be $10 or $500 -- These Energy Stocks Continue to Profit -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 08:15:00,"Investing in oil can involve a lot of volatility -- unless you invest in this part of the industry. ) Dec 20, 2014 at 9:15AM The price of oil hasn't received this much media attention since, well, the last time oil prices moved this quickly in a matter of months. Since this past summer, the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has been cut almost in half. As you can imagine, this has caused panic in the streets when it comes to energy stocks as investors have been heading to the exits faster than the rush to get a new TV on Black Friday. WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts While owning energy companies can help add needed diversity to many investors' portfolios, the simple fact that oil prices can go on these wild benders is enough to scare many people away. Luckily for those who are terrified of seeing the share price of an investment get pulled every which way by the whims of oil prices, there is a subset of the energy business that may be just for you: pipelines. Let's take a look at this set of companies. No matter what the price of oil may be on any given day, chances are that these companies' profits will remain almost untouched. It's not the price that matters, it's how much you move it The most cost-efficient and -- despite the occasional spill -- the safest means for transporting oil and gas is via pipeline, and the U.S. has built out a massive network of pipelines to move them. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Even so, the oil and gas industry cannot afford to be complacent. The risks associated with robust climate-change policy and rapidly changing technology are too great, Hittle said. The forecast notes that international oil companies and national oil companies will be severely challenged, and will face asset impairments, bankruptcy and restructurings on a scale far greater than that of 2020. Our scenario would see the end of Big Oil and the rise of Big Energy, Hittle said in her note. Financially strong integrated companies step up their investment plans to supplement dwindling upstream revenue with new cash flow from renewables, hydrogen and CCS (carbon capture storage). The oil and gas industry cannot afford to be complacent Ann-Louise Hittle, vice-president Macro Oils at Wood Mackenzie But Wood Mackenzie says that grim scenario would depend on a number of drivers to come together. The study assumes that all sectors of the economy will rapidly electrify and the power generation sector will decarbonize through more renewables being added to the grid and the switch from coal to natural gas. It also assumes a big ramp up in carbon capture and storage projects to a total global capacity of 5 billion tonnes of CO2 storage per year as well as a big increase in hydrogen production to 380 million tonnes by 2050. In the automotive sector, that means that 80 per cent of all new vehicles sold in 2050 are electric and that even ships and long-haul trucks are powered by hydrogen.

COVID-19 9 mins ago Wood Mackenzie said under its accelerated energy transition scenario, the energy market would be increasingly electrified through to 2050, squeezing out the most polluting hydrocarbons, like oil. Under this scenario, oil demand could fall 70% by 2050 from current levels, the report said. Wood Mackenzie forecast demand for oil would start to fall from 2023 under this scenario and this decline would quickly accelerate thereafter, with year-on-year falls of around 2 million barrels a day. The report said oil prices could go into ""terminal decline,"" with international benchmark Brent crudefalling to between $37 and $42 a barrel by 2030. Brent crude futures traded at $66.29 a barrel during morning deals in London, down around 0.4%.

View Comments Environmentalists from New Mexicos major oil and gas regions called on the state to strengthen oil and gas regulations amid a pause on new leases of public land for fossil fuel development instituted by President Joe Bidens administration. During a Wednesday press conference with stakeholder groups from the Permian Basin in the southeast region and Chaco Canyon area to the northwest, advocates voiced support for the temporary halt on leasing and called for increased funding for oversight of oil and gas. Multiple speakers in the meeting voiced concern that New Mexicos state leadership could seek a waiver from federal climate change actions, as Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and her cabinet recently wrote public letters to the Biden administration explaining the economic harm that could be brought on through a disruption of fossil fuel production. More: 'It doesn't feel like home anymore."" Locals fight oil and gas' impact on Carlsbad area Gene Harbaugh of Citizens Caring for the Future, a local group in Carlsbad focused on the Permian Basin, said growing oil and gas development in the area could threaten local water supplies for another major New Mexico industry: agriculture. The advent of gas and oil exploration and extraction has led to the competition for water. Many farmers and rancher have sold water to the oil companies. When the oil boom subsides, it will not be possible to remediate the damage that has been done, he said. The short term economic impacts need to be balance with effects on the land. The whole impact of the industry has played upon not only the vulnerability of the workers that come here, but also on the people who live here. More: Data: Energy and oil and gas jobs remain lucrative in New Mexico, nationwide amid COVID-19 The meeting came on the last day the U.S. Department of the Interior accepted public comments on its review of the federal oil and gas leasing program, and Carlsbad resident Kayley Shoup said federal energy policy should be reformed to protect local communities near oil and gas facilities. She said the state and nation should work to transition away from fossil fuels to better protect the environment from pollution. Its not easy to speak out in southeast New Mexico because the local economy is dependent on the oil and gas industry, Shoup said. As a young New Mexican, I dont want to have to continue have the conversation about diversifying the economy. We must stop simply talking about a green future and begin building one for the sake of our young people. More: New Mexico spent millions plugging abandoned oil and gas wells in 2020 Nathalie Eddy, a field organizer with national environmental group Earthworks said during multiple visits the Permian and Chaco Canyon areas, air-polluting emissions were witnessed as she use forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras to document releases of natural gas Eddy said could not be seen otherwise. In both corners of the state, day in and day out were finding oil and gas pollution everywhere we go. Finding this pollution and what were seeing is coming from big and small operators, Eddy said. This business as usual is going to spell climate destruction for the rest of us. She said the State lacked adequate resources for oversight of oil and gas. When it comes to enforcement in New Mexico, the state regulatory agencies are no match for the industry. They simply cant hold the industry accountable, Eddy said. While this isnt news, it is an urgent call to activism. The harm is disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities like the Permian and San Juan basins. More: Local New Mexico leaders defend oil and gas industry amid federal leasing review Julia Bernal of the Pueblo Action Alliance based northwest New Mexico said the federal Bureau of Land Management  an arm of the DOI  should amend its resource management plan for the area to prioritize Tribal issues and environmental protections over fossil fuel extraction. She said oil and gas development in the San Juan Basin caused alarming levels of air pollutants and the government should step in to repair the damage and prevent future environmental harm. The oil and gas program review is extremely long overdue as Pueblo youth have spoken out against the use and exploitation of fossil fuels because this isnt the future our young people want, Bernal said.

NEW YORK  Oil prices surged more than 4% on Wednesday, after a report from the International Energy Agency, followed by U.S. inventory data boosted optimism about returning demand for crude. Source: Reuters Brent crude futures rose $2.70, or 4.2%, to $66.37 a barrel by 11:05 a.m. EDT (1505 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up $2.78, or 4.6%, to $62.96 a barrel. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, exceeding analysts forecasts for a 2.9 million-barrel drop. East Coast crude stocks hit a record low. Gasoline supplied in latest week, indicating the U.S. consumption of the fuel, rose to 8.9 million barrels per day, the highest since August, the EIA report showed. Gasoline stocks edged higher by 309,000 barrels, less than expectations for a 786,000-barrel rise. Distillate stockpiles fell by 2.1 million barrels in the week, versus expectations for a 971,000-barrel rise. All in all, it was a very supportive report, said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. It really looks like were getting a return to some more solid demand numbers and that should keep us going. Earlier in the session, oil prices rose on a report from the International Energy Agency that predicted global oil demand and supply were set to rebalance in the second half of the year. It added that producers may then need to pump an additional 2 million bpd to meet the expected demand. That IEA report is one of the best ones weve seen them publish in awhile in terms of being optimistic about the continued rebound in demand, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Similarly, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Tuesday raised its global demand forecast by 70,000 bpd from last months forecast and now expects global demand to rise by 5.95 million bpd in 2021.

Tight gas shale is a similar phenomenon, but shale rock's tendency to spread laterally makes horizontal drilling perhaps even more critical. Also, horizontal drilling capacity means that the city of Fort Worth doesn't have to be relocated in order to get at the giant Barnett Shale gas field, in which Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) claims over 600 million BOEin proved reserves. According to Schlumberger, tight gas shales today draw the majority of land drilling in the U.S. Coal bed methane was first viewed as a nuisance that had a nasty tendency of seeping into coal mines and killing miners. It used to be vented straight into the atmosphere, but with gas prices high, this too has become an economically viable source of natural gas (which is, by the way, mostly methane). Coal seams tend to be shallow, making drilling quicker, but the reservoir pressure tends to be low, which requires advanced compression solutions.

892,"The Fastest Way to Stop Oil and Gas Drilling, Part 1 -- The Motley Fool",fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 23:00:00,"Energy tax hikes may slow drilling across a growing portion of the planet. ) Oct 3, 2011 at 12:00AM In today's sometimes desperate world, even nations blessed with ample supplies of fossil fuels often search for ways to prop up their sagging economies. In those places, the most obvious targets for funding frequently involve companies that are producing hydrocarbons from beneath the ground. You get the picture: Tax 'em, and then tax 'em some more. A prime example of this phenomenon lies with our British friends. And we'll detail in the second partof this article that in the U.S, the Obama administration isn't far behind in what's almost certain to become a major tax-centered ballyhoo. However, the head start across the pond appears to have already resulted in a substantial 52% quarterly drop in North Sea drilling activity -- a phenomenon that could foreshadow our fate should our administration's proposed ramp in energy taxes become reality. Floundering North Sea You probably know that many oil and gas fields dotting the North Sea are becoming tired and producing less than they have in the past. Nevertheless, with the British economy in desperate straits, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has laid on his citizenry a 2011 budget that -- since it includes a windfall tax on energy -- is forcing North Sea oil companies to cough up considerably more in production taxes than before. Actually, Osborne's complex gambit can be reduced to a couple of key parts. First, the government's tax withdrawal on North Sea oil and gas has been boosted by more than 50%, from 20% to 32%, a hike that --- as would be expected -- hasn't set well with the industry. Conversely, with inflation hitting the nation, British motorists are being protected -- by Osborne's boost in taxes -- from the need to ante up additional pounds at petrol and diesel tanks. When the budget was unveiled, James Smith, the chairman ofRoyal Dutch Shell's (NYSE: RDS-B) U.K. operations, essentially dismissed any notion that the companies might pass along their higher North Sea costs. As he correctly pointed out, oil trades globally. As such, isolated changes in a single producing venue -- e.g., the North Sea -- generally have minimal effect on the prices of worldwide crude. If you follow the potential chain of events from imposing higher North Sea taxes, you'll be struck by its possible damage to the British economy. For instance, the country's energy industry accounts for about 500,000 jobs and brings in approximately $30 billion a year. Furthermore, there's a real possibility that 25 or more planned developments, representing about 1 billion barrels of reserves, could be halted by Osborne's increased levies. Amazingly, it appears that North Sea offshore exploratory drilling plummeted in short order. Lest you blame that precipitous drop on blanket economic softness, you should know that activity on Norway's Continental Shelf increased by 10% during the same time and that the Netherlands maintained rates comparable to those of 2010. Big Oil bailing And here's a cynical believe-it-or-not: The industry has noticed the potential damages and is taking steps to avoid them. For instance, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and France's Total (NYSE: TOT) have figuratively hung for-sale signs on at least a portion of their assets in the affected area. And as time passes, I'm inclined to look for offerings from other operators. Indeed, just last week, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) announced that, because of the more onerous taxation, it is selling a portion of its North Sea assets to Apache (NYSE: APA) for $1.75 billion. The fields involved in the transaction produce about 19,000 barrels of oil and 58 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Norway's Statoil (NYSE: STO) also temporarily halted work on a pair of North Sea projects in an effort to avoid the tax hit -- and on the probable assumption that the heightened tax rates would revert to prior levels. According to the company, the two fields, called the Mariner and Bressay, had been intended to begin production around 2017. In any event, we Fools should continue to pay attention to added changes to Chancellor Osborne's windfall tax, additional asset sales in the North Sea, and reductions in the British government's tax receipts from the North Sea, which clearly would constitute a disaster for the country's overall economy. As for those of us in the U.S., we can only hope that the powers-that-be opt not to follow the approaches taken by the U.K. From an investment perspective, my primary inclination is to watch ExxonMobil closely -- considering its role as the first to unload North Sea assets, for its new Arctic partnership with Russia's OAO Rosneft, and its role as our nation's leading producer of natural gas.

893,The Outlook for Oil and Gas Shares: Part 2 -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 23:00:00,"David Kuo continues talking with Malcolm Graham-Wood from VSA Capital about the state of the oil sector. ) Aug 15, 2012 at 12:00AM This is the second part of a two-part transcript in which Fool.co.uk's David Kuo welcomes back Malcolm Graham-Wood from VSA Capital to chat about the state of the oil sector. They look at the outlook for oil prices and dissect the latest results from Royal Dutch Shell, BP, and BG Group. Malcolm also offers his opinion on a number of popular oil explorers that include Rockhopper Exploration (LSE: RKH.L) , Falkland Oil & Gas, Gulf Keystone Petroleum (LSE: GKP.L) , and Ophir Energy. You can read the first part of the transcript here You can listen to or download the full podcast here David: OK. I'd like to have a look at some of the companies that we talked at length about the last time you were here, and one company is Rockhopper. When you came in, the shares were 371; today they're 202. What's gone wrong with Rockhopper? Malcolm: Yes -- this is where you have me on some of the nightmare recommendations! David: No, no -- this has nothing to do with recommendations, but I mean, this is just generally what's going on. Malcolm: I would say that Rockhopper is still worth much more than 371 pence. Since then, they've carried on with the development of Sealion, which is their big discovery. Don't forget they had a proper discovery, a billion barrels of oil in Sealion, and even at 45% recoverable, at $100 a barrel, that doesn't add up to a share price of 2 pounds a share. The trouble is, it's market perceptions, it's been a difficult quarter or so for most of these companies at the best of times, and a bit like, when we're bound to come onto Gulf Keystone and whatever it happens to be, in a lot of these places, the asset is there and full of value, but the market, and dare I say it, some of the retail market is a little more short-term than others, and they don't take as long a term view. I think that someone should either take over, or even Premier should take over Rockhopper at these levels, because I think it's frightfully cheap, and I think the deal that Premier did, it was interesting that it was Premier that did it, was a good deal for both companies. I would say there was an argument at the time that Premier might have been better off just buying Rockhopper, rather than just farming into 60% of the acreage. Our valuation of Rockhopper before was 750 pence; given the valuations that they've put on it, you might take that down a little bit from here. I've seen people saying it's probably worth five or six pounds. The point is that, we're coming back to people who are prepared to buy barrels of oil. If you look, compared to what CNOOC paid for Nexen which is Canada and the North Sea and other bits and pieces, is that providing you're prepared to overlook any political problems in the Falklands, then this is a billion barrels of oil, which one day will be worth significantly more than this price, and I'm afraid it's patience -- nothing more, nothing less. David: OK, now one that has done well is Falkland Oil and Gas. That has actually gone from about 60 pence to 80 pence. We also heard some news about Falkland Oil and Gas just today, believe it or not, with Noble trying to take a stake in Falkland Oil and Gas. What do you make of this company in general? Malcolm: I like Falkland Oil and Gas. I like Tim Bushell, the guy who runs it -- he's a smart guy, he's got a very good team, and he's done two very good farm-out deals. The difference between obviously FOGL and Rockhopper is that FOGL haven't actually found anything yet. They're in all the right places, but the good thing is, and what they have found, is people to put their hands in their pockets to partner with, and to fund their exploration. And what you've got now, after yesterday's deal -- and it's very interesting that Noble, which is a really, really smart U.S. company, and the sort of company that I would really like to partner with, have come in and said they were going to put 180 million to 230 million into this, in the north and south part of the Falklands -- is that Tim Bushell is now funded for the foreseeable future. The big worry about these things is, you haven't got any oil, you haven't got any money -- well, they've now got lots of money, and they receive back funding for wells. They've got Loligo, which they spudded last Friday, which is going to be their first interesting well in the north, but they're funded for the next two wells up there, and they've got $200 million on the bank. I think that FOGL look very exciting; as I say, it's an exploration, it's ranked exploration, in different areas of the Falklands, but I think they've done a cracking deal, and I would want to be a holder of this stock. David: OK, so is there a kind of tacit approval by the U.S. government for the sovereign status of Falklands by Noble taking a stake in Falkland Oil and Gas now? Malcolm: Not particularly. I mean, Tim Bushell said yesterday that he thought that it had been made clear that Noble had spoken to the State Department before doing it, so my guess is that the State Department probably wouldn't interfere positively by saying yeah, go do it, but I suspect they would say, if there was something horribly wrong and they're about to change their policy, don't do it yet. Don't forget, we have an election in a few months' time in the States, and so everything's going to change anyway, but a Republican administration would be more pro-oil anyway, I suspect. There's been a cooling of the situation between the States. They've certainly become more friendly with the South Americans over the last few years, but I think that Noble would have been warned off, if it was something they thought they definitely shouldn't do, and they weren't warned off, so that's probably quite good news. I mean, investing in the Falklands is something not everyone can do. If you have any operations in South America, it's probably a waste of your time. BHP were in with FOGL before, but you wouldn't want to have a whole bunch of petrol stations in Venezuela, if you started to irritate the Argentineans, or vice-versa. But interestingly, we've got two or three, we've certainly got one really interesting company called President, which is operating in Argentina at the moment, and doing very well. David: OK. Let's have a look at one that hasn't done that well, and that's Borders & Southern. What's gone wrong there? Malcolm: I mean, that's just dry holes-ville. They've had two wells... David: Is that just bad luck? Malcolm: Yeah, I mean it used to be one in twenty on a wild cat exploration well, and it's better than that now with better seismic, 2-D and 3-D seismic. But it's still easy enough to drill a dry hole. Their first well in the Falklands was not too bad, but it was condensate, and everyone wanted oil, not sort of wet gas or liquids-rich gas, or anything like that. So the stock ran out, I mean the retail market, which this stock, if you remember it went from 72 pence to 140 pence in the space of three days, when people thought that well was going to come in. Now, it didn'",https://www.fool.com/investing/international/2012/08/15/the-outlook-for-oil-and-gas-shares-part-2.aspx

You should always take future estimates with a grain of salt, particularly when analyst forecasts are involved. In fact, studies show that analysts' long-term earnings-per-share estimates tend to be over-optimistic by roughly 40%, so I've reduced their estimates accordingly. But investing is all about making predictions based on imperfect knowledge of the future. So long as we're aware of the need to think critically about a company's prospects and to build a margin of safety into our stock purchases, analyst estimates can be a helpful tool for generating ideas. By running the numbers, we can round up the stocks that represent their implied best buys today.

897,Oil and Gas Buying Opportunities -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 23:00:00,"There's value in the picks-and-shovels sector of equipment and services. 2.7 Figures based on rolling 12-month forecasts. You may not get much of a dividend from these companies -- Amec's yield of 3.2% is as good as it gets -- but what you can expect is robust earnings growth relative to the P/E rating. While it's true you could have picked up shares in these companies cheaper than they are today during the market slump of May/June, they still look decent value on a PEG basis, despite some strong rebounds in their share prices. Let's have a closer look at them. Petrofac The biggest of the five companies -- ranked 60 in the elite FTSE 100 index -- oil-field services companyPetrofac was established in 1981 when it employed just 25 people. The company has grown rapidly and now has some 16,500 staff worldwide. In the last five years, Petrofac has increased its earnings threefold. This year, revenue is expected to break through the $6 billion mark for the first time, and the company is bullish on profit growth. In a trading update in June, ahead of half-year results scheduled for this coming Monday, Petrofac said it was ""on course to deliver net profit growth in 2012 of at least 15%."" For a company with Petrofac's track record, a PEG ratio of 0.8 looks pretty appealing. Estimated net cash of $700 million on the balance sheet at  June 30 adds to the attraction. Amec Another FTSE 100 company, Amec, which provides consultancy, engineering and project management services is a little more diversified than Petrofac. Amec supplies the mining, clean-energy and infrastructure markets in addition to the oil and gas industry. Amec started life as a humble U.K.-based construction firm in 1848, but today operates globally with 27,000 employees serving some of the world's biggest organizations, including BP and Shell. Amec has half-year results scheduled for Thursday. In April, the company reported it had performed in line with expectations during the first three months of the year. Amec added it was continuing to see healthy demand for its services and was ""confident that this will support double-digit underlying revenue growth in 2012."" Like Petrofac, Amec has a PEG ratio of 0.8 and a strong balance sheet. At Dec. 31, 2011, net cash stood at 521 million pounds and the directors earmarked 400 million pounds for share buybacks in 2012. Wood, Hunting and Kentz These three firms are all listed in the FTSE 250. They have somewhat more attractive PEG ratios than their FTSE 100 peers. The PEGs in the case of Wood (0.6) and Hunting (0.4) are premised on very strong forecast earnings growth of 25% and 29%, respectively. In the case of Kentz (0.7), the smallest of the companies, the PEG arises as a result of a lower P/E and relatively modest earnings growth of 14%. I particularly like Hunting. I've owned shares in the firm for several years. Hunting provides equipment and services to oil and gas operatorsin the areas of well construction, well completion and well intervention. I wrote bullishly about Hunting back in March, when the shares were trading above their current level. Today, they are on a very attractive PEG of 0.4 and I expect the company to deliver on the forecast earnings growth.

898,5 Oil and Gas Stocks That Should Bounce Back  -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 23:00:00,"Following the carnage last week, these stocks present a buying opportunity. ) Apr 18, 2012 at 12:00AM The five-day carnage on the Street starting last week saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plungea whopping 4.14%. The most obvious conclusion is that the market is undergoing a correction following a three-month rally that started at the turn of the year. Tried-and-true strategies But some believe that this might not be the case. Investors who relied on strategies that worked in the past might not be able to reap similar gains this time. While there is merit in the above conclusion, this isn't necessarily applicable to every industry. For instance, the average drop last week for nearly 200 stocks in oil exploration and production was about 5%. Now this kind of a drop, I believe, may have been overdone. With crude oil trading at $103 per barrel and no obvious signs of a shortfall in crude oil demand, exploration and production companies with strong fundamentals should inevitably recover. Here are five exploration and production stocks that, I believe, should make a strong recovery following last week's thrashing: Samson Oil & Gas (AMEX: SSN) : The stock fell more than 14% in one week. And the move by the market might be justified. This is a company whose cash outflows are currently greater than its inflows, thanks to substantial capital expenses and barely any profits. But what the market might have missed is this: Samson is developing its reserves in the Bakken, which should substantially add to production this year Once this happens, I expect much stronger cash flows. In simple terms, it's an up-and-coming exploration company and its current situation doesn't really surprise me. Add Samson Oil & Gas to your watchlist Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) : This stock fell almost 6% in one week and is currently trading near $88. However, according to S&P Capital IQ estimates, the stock is expected to pull up to $118. Now that's a real opportunity ahead. But I'm not too surprised. Occidental has been patiently exploiting the California shale plays with a single-minded focus on increasing shareholder returns.The company has an uncanny ability to allocate capital so as to achieve returns that are well above the cost of capital. Domestic production hit a record high in 2011 at 449,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day -- a figure that should go up this year. Add Occidental Petroleum to your watchlist McMoRan Exploration (NYSE: MMR) : This stock received a 12% hammering and now trades near $8.60. Analysts at S&P Capital IQ have a price target of $16. McMoRan's expectations are built around the Davy Jones wells. However, initial flow tests were hindered due to an equipment malfunction last month, which saw its shares plummet15%. That drop was followed by last week's carnage. In all, McMoRan saw its market cap shaved off by 34% in one month. However, the good news is that in its latest update this week, the company successfully completed all activities for the flow test with only commercial production remaining. 2012 could definethis company. Add McMoRan Exploration to your watchlist Penn West Petroleum (NYSE: PWE) : This stock fell 3.90% last week and now trades near $17. Analysts have a price target of $28. This Canadian exploration and production company has access to one of the world's largest reserves -- the Athabasca oil sands. The income trust turned corporation is currently developingthe prolific light-oil plays in Vikings, Spearfish, Carbonates, and Cardium. Currently, Penn West is among the largest light oil producers in Canada. I'm looking at a solid production hike this year. This dividend stock looks fundamentally sound. Add Penn West Petroleum to your watchlist Ultra Petroleum (NYSE: UPL) : I've reserved the last spot for the underdog. This natural-gas producer has been through bad times, with the stock losing 60% of its market cap in the last 12 months. Natural gas, at $2.00 per Mcf, isn't really profitable for any company. Ultra has a low cost structure, which could help it stay afloat in the current environment. Fellow Fool Dan Dzombak pointed out that while most natural-gas producers are getting crushed due to high production costs, Ultra has been a low-cost producer at $2.82 per Mcf. This is where the company has a distinct advantage over its rivals. And natural-gas prices aren't going to stay at current levels for a long time. Dan points out that demand will eventually rise Prices in the range of $5 to $6 per Mcf will be hugely profitable for Ultra Petroleum. Analysts have put a price target of $32 on this stock, which is currently trading around $18. Add Ultra Petroleum to your watchlist Foolish bottom line These companies have sound business fundamentals, which is what makes me bullish about them. Eventually, that's more important than short-term market-driven sentiments. However, if you're looking for one energy stock, we've got a stock idea that could knock your socks off.

899,Russia Combines Oil and Gas -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 23:00:00,"Gazprom and Rosneft will merge and trade freely. , or SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) than it would have been if she had to figure out how to buy shares on the Helsinki, London, or Munich stock exchanges. But on the other hand, there are the -- to put it politely -- ""inefficiencies"" of buying ADRs. The less polite way of putting it, of course, is to call it what it is: ""price gouging."" The more in demand an ADR is, and the lower its U.S. float, the more the laws of supply and demand will distort the price of an ADR from the price of the underlying securities on their home market. And there are few instances of more egregious distortions than you will find with the ADRs of Russian gas giant Gazprom (OTC BB: OGZPF). Recently, the price of an ADR in the world's largest natural gas producer has run about 60% higher than the price of plain-vanilla Gazprom shares bought in Russia. The problem, of course, was that you couldn't buy the plain-vanilla Gazprom shares, even if you knew how. Because Russian law forbade foreigners buying Gazprom shares even in Russia and also limited foreigners as a class to owning no more than 20% of the equity in Gazprom. Which is why energy sector investors should be jumping for joy today after hearing the newsthat (1) Gazprom will be acquiring the Russian government-owned oil company Rosneft and (2) as a result of the Russian state cementing its controlling stake over Gazprom through this deal, the Kremlin now feels sufficiently sure of itself to let Gazprom's shares trade freely abroad. Over in Moscow, investors are already exultant over the news. In late Tuesday trading, the price of domestic Gazprom shares jumped 15%, and Gazprom ADRs rose in value as well. But in anticipation of a closing of the gap in pricing between domestic Gazprom shares and their foreign ADRs, the ADRs rose in price only about 5% -- narrowing the disparity in value from 60% to ""just"" 45%. That's still a pretty big gap, however. Rather than being tempted to buy into the rapidly appreciating Gazprom, Foolish investors should consider sitting this oil rush out and waiting for the prices of the two equity forms to equalize.

901,"Oil & Gas Stock Roundup Headlined by Shell, BP, Phillips 66 & Valero Q1 Updates",zacks,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 22:12:19,"Shell (RDS.A), BP plc (BP), Phillips 66 (PSX) and Valero Energy (VLO) issued updates on their upcoming Q1 earnings. Meanwhile, Enerplus (ERF) agreed to buy some of Hess' (HES) Williston Basin assets for $312 million. Free Report )     Williston Basin assets for $312 million. Overall, it was a not-so-good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 3.5% to close at $59.32 per barrel and natural gas prices fell 4.3% in the week to end at $2.53 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). In particular, the oil market hit a speed bump after posting a small gain the previous week Coming back to the week ended Apr 9, oil prices posted a decline, as rising COVID-19 cases in densely populated countries like Brazil and India heightened worries about energy demand. Prices were also dragged down by the U.S. government data showing a weekly build in gasoline and distillate supplies. Natural gas finished down too on the prospect of moderate spring temperatures and dull power demand. Recap of the Weeks Most-Important Stories 1. Royal Dutch Shell recently provided an update on its first-quarter 2021 guidance. The Texas winter storm disrupted the companys operations and is estimated to bear a negative impact of up to $200 million on its adjusted earnings. The upstream production is projected between 2,400 and 2,475 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Shell had earlier predicted its first-quarter 2021 upstream volumes to be 2,400-2,600 thousand boe/d. The narrower range reflects the impact of the Texas winter storm. Taking into account the improvement in currently realized liquid prices, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company expects to recognize positive adjusted earnings from this segment. Shell estimates first-quarter oil product sales in the band of 3,700-4,700 thousand barrels per day. You can see the complete list of todays Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . The companys chemical sales volumes are predicted between 3,500 and 3,700 thousand tons with the plant utilization of 77-81% of the producing volumes. The company expects first-quarter LNG liquefaction volumes to contract to 7.8-8.4 million tons from its previous years quarterly output of 8.88 million tons. ( Shell Renews Q1 View, Foresees Lower Upstream Output ) 2. BP is expected to have reached the $35-billion net debt goal in first-quarter 2021, as announced by the company. Following the announcement, the stock jumped 3.5% as its debt burden has been a concern for investors for a long time. Reaching the debt-reduction target early will boost its financial flexibility. The company had net debt of $38.9 billion at fourth quarter-end. On the earnings call during that period, management highlighted its target of reaching $35 billion net debt by fourth-quarter 2021 or first quarter next year. A strong first-quarter performance supported by trading activities and earlier-than-expected proceeds received from disposals have enabled the company to reach the goal well ahead of schedule. In the March quarter, the company received about $4.7 billion in proceeds from disposal, which included stake sale in Omans Block 61, global petrochemical divestment to INEOS and others. As a result, the British energy giant is now expecting 2021 disposal proceeds to be at the upper limit of the $4-6 billion guided range. It expects to generate a total of $25 billion from asset sale by 2025, of which it has already received $10 billion. ( BP Reduces Debt Load Ahead of Schedule on Strong Q1 Show ) 3. Phillips 66 has provided preliminary financial information about the March quarter of this year. The diversified energy manufacturing and logistics company announced that its operations in the Central and Gulf Coast regions were significantly affected by the severe winter storms. Notably, the storm caused havoc to power and gas supply systems in U.S. central and southern states, thereby affecting the utilization of the companys assets. The storm also led to higher expenses associated with utility, maintenance and repair across the companys Midstream, Chemicals and Refining business units. With the surge in natural gas and electricity prices across several markets, following the winter storm-induced supply outages, the company witnessed an uptick in utility expenses. Phillips 66 added that dented global demand for refined petroleum products owing to the coronavirus pandemic continued to hurt its Refining and Marketing and Specialties segments in the first quarter of this year. It is to be noted that the company projects its utilization of the chemical plants at mid-70% in the March quarter, lower than its prior guidance of mid-90%. Importantly, Phillips 66 projects adjusted net loss of $550 million to $700 million for the first quarter. This is owing to the fierce winter storm that hurt the production line and bumped up costs. ( Phillips 66 Sees US Storm Impact on Q1 Bottom Line ) 4. Valero Energy recently provided an update on its March quarter. The international manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels and petrochemical products added that its refining and ethanol business segments were impacted significantly by a severe winter and ice storm, dubbed unofficially as Winter Storm Uri. Notably, the storm, which caused havoc to power systems in Texas, led the company to predict higher-than-expected incurrence of costs associated to natural gas and electricity through the first quarter of 2021 by its refining and ethanol units. The company has made the estimation of the excess energy costs in the range of $520 million to $535 million. The company added that the excess costs mostly affected its refining businesses across the U.S. Gulf Coast region and U.S. Mid-Continent region. Following the severe impact of the winter storm, Valero Energy now projects first-quarter net loss attributable to its stockholders in the band of $1.81 to $2.05 per share. ( Valero Sees Winter Storm Uri Impact on Q1 Bottom Line ) 5. Enerplus recently announced an agreement with Hess. Notably, the companies have valued the transaction at $312 million of cash considerations. Per the accord, likely to get closed in May 2021, Enerplus will be acquiring assets in the Williston Basin. The to-be acquired assets signify 78,700 largely contiguous net acres in Dunn County, North Dakota. Importantly, the core acreage has a strong inventory of premium drilling locations, brightening the production outlook. Enerplus, an independent oil and gas exploration and production company in North America, also recently made a major update to its guidance for 2021 in connection with the acquisition of the assets. The company has revised its 2021 daily production guidance from 103,500 to 108,500 barrel of oil equivalent (BoE) to 111,000 to 115,000 BoE. Enerplus has also revised its capital spending guidance for this year from $335-$385 million to $360-$400 million. The company also predicts cumulative free cashflow of $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion from 2021 to 2025 with the assumption that West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price will be between $50 per barrel and $55 per barrel.

So where is this leading to? Will the U.S. energy sector continue to underperform? Or will we witness a breakthrough in this industry? Unimpressive so far? Apparently, the unconventional oil- and gas-producing regions haven't been too impressive. Thanks to technological challenges coupled with high extraction costs, producers haven't really been able to add value or see a decent return on investment thus far. Additionally, natural gas prices remained depressed -- even below extraction costs for some producers -- over the past two years. Simply put, the general pessimism regarding the overall energy sector seems to be hanging heavy in the markets. However, that is also where discerning investors see opportunity. Unfortunately, this also comes with a rider: We are looking at a long-term perspective here.

925,3 Energy Companies That Will Do Well Despite Low Oil Prices -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 18:08:00,"With low volatility and high dividends, these three companies will surely complement your portfolio. YCharts Yet not all energy companies suffered the same fate. A particular sub-sector in the energy industry fared much better than the average producers: the midstream sector. The S&P index that tracks a consortium of midstream players, often structured as Master Limited Partnerships, fell by only 12% over the past year. What is so special about midstream companies and why are they able to withstand the volatility of the commodity? Let's take a look at the basics of a midstream company and examine three promising investment candidates. How Midstream Companies Are Different When we think of oil and gas companies, we get the impression that they drill holes and sell the fossil fuel. We call them ""upstream"" companies. It should be no surprise that their stock value is highly correlated with commodity prices. Instead of selling the commodity, though, midstream companies deal with the infrastructure needed to facilitate sale. They operate pipelines and other logistical assets that are critical to the industry. If managed properly, a midstream company's profitability is stable and much less correlated to the commodity than its upstream peers. This is because a midstream company's services are often fee-based and it applies a stable margin on products regardless of commodity prices. As prices decline, the company's costs decrease along with revenue. Hence a midstream company is able to maintain stable margins in all but the most pessimistic scenarios. Due to relatively predictable cash flow and capital expenditure needs, many can afford to pay large dividends. They are often structured as Master Limited Partnerships as well for tax efficiency purposes. Combining the above factors, midstream companies are great for income investors looking to have exposure to the energy industry without having to deal with the volatility in distributions. Let's take a look at three examples: Source: www.plainsallamerican.com 1. Plains All American Pipeline ( NYSE:PAA ) Plains All American Pipeline has been in operation since 1998 and has pipelines stretching from Alberta, Canada to Corpus Christi in the U.S. This extensive network services both ""supply push"" and ""demand pull"" activities, hence the company's pipelines will always be in demand as long as there is a need for oil. It also has a fantastic dividend history, it has never missed a single payment in the past 10 years. Over the same period of time, dividends increased from $0.325 per quarter to $0.685 per quarter today and share price more than doubled to $45. What's even more amazing is that the company never suffered a loss in 10 years and grew its income from $218 million in 2005 to $1384 million in 2014. 2. Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE: MMP) Much like Plains All American Pipeline, this company also has a great dividend history. While Magellan is mostly known for its refined products pipelines that deliver refined petroleum products like gasoline and diesel to end markets, the company is also investing heavily in crude oil pipelines as of late. Many of its refined product pipelines are in non-competitive regions and the company charges fixed rates regulated by the FERC. The company had an average 20% net income margin over the past five years. Dividends increased from $0.2488 per quarter 10 years ago to $0.7175 per quarter today. Over the same period of time, shares appreciated by 380%, from $16 to $77 today. 3. NuStar Energy L.P (NYSE: NS) While smaller than the previous two firms, NuStar Energy has the same business model that can prosper at all points in the commodity cycle. The company has pipelines in North Dakota all the way to Texas along with refined product terminals on both coasts. Its operations have generated consistent cash flow, with no missed payments since the first dividend in 2007. The company also recently created a $125 million account receivable facility. The facility will allow the company to sell its receivables which means that cash will be received earlier. This will improve liquidity which is extremely important for dividend payouts.. The dividend has climbed steadily from $0.915 per quarter in 2007 to $1.095 per quarter today. Despite its stable business, the current market pessimism is giving you the opportunity to invest at a yield of 7%. Takeaway Midstream companies are very stable businesses that can maintain distributions despite fluctuations in commodity prices. Unless a company is over-leveraged and artificially creates volatility in its cash flow, a midstream company is usually a great choice for investors looking for stable dividends over time.

Policy & Regulations Oil and Gas Investor Energy Policy: Biden Policies Bring New Risks and Uncertainty Over the past few weeks, we have seen a substantial shift in public policy in the U.S. that will have significant implications for the domestic oil and gas industry. Jack Belcher, Cornerstone Government Affairs Wed, 04/14/2021 - 12:05 PM We often hear that, in the Biden administration, all policy is being looked at through lenses of climate change and environmental justice. The experience thus far bears that out, writes Jack Belcher. (Source: Image of U.S. President Joe Biden by archna nautiyal / Shutterstock.com) [Editor's note: A version of this story appears in the April 2021 issue of Oil and Gas Investor magazine.] Over the past few weeks, we have seen a substantial shift in public policy in the U.S. that will have significant implications for the domestic oil and gas industry. The Biden administrations early issuance of executive orders and policy objectives have set a very different tone from that of the past four years, when the U.S. embraced the concept of energy dominance. While it is too early to know how far the administration will go in taking policy steps to reduce U.S. oil and gas production, we do know quite a bit already. The administration is taking a serious review of oil and gas leasing and permitting processes on federal lands. The 60-day pause in Interior Department decision-making by delegated authorities indicates a serious effort to contemplate new requirements for the issuance of leases, permits (APDs) and rights-of-way (ROW). Looking ahead, we can expect a stringent climate impact assessment to be applied to all decisions regarding oil and gas on federal lands and stricter criteria in environmental reviews. All of this will likely lead to a slower timeline in the issuance of APDs and ROWs and less acreage being offered in fewer areas with less frequency in federal oil and gas lease sales, both onshore and offshore. The degree to which these stricter standards will be applied remains unclear. Already have an account? Thanks for reading Hart Energy.

With San Patricio County home to several wind farms, which provide tax funds, Christian is eyeing the future of Texas energy as coal, oil and gas  especially through the rough year 2020 brought on the energy industries. The thing is, I have been really encouraged during all the hard things that the year brought, Christian said. The private free market industry can almost always do a better job than government regulations. Ive seen some of the biggest challenges  if not the biggest challenges  hit our industry this past year, and every single time we turn to the free market industry. They overperformed and came to the rescue much better than I think government has ever been designed to do and I think its a great Texas brag. Staples added, Well, you know, its interesting that some states and countries dont operate on the model of working together rather than working against one another. And I think thats how problems are solved. He said that just last year oil was at $24 a barrel and unsure what the future of COVID-19 would hold. Christian met with TXOGA last year and during the oil crisis who then formed the Blue Ribbon Task Force who met and strategized on how to keep the oil pumping during such a difficult time. So what happened of course was the industry saved the United States, Christian said. No doubt the oil and gas industry out here has, since the turn of the century, saved and revolutionized and made a safer, cleaner, better world. This past year specifically because we first were hit with a fight that OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and Russia got together and decided they were going to stop production and get prices going at the same time here comes China with this virus  were not supposed to call it that but Im sorry Mr. Biden  that caused a pandemic worldwide and decreased demand. He continued by saying that the past presidential administration did a great job working for the coal, oil and gas industry. He feels they had support in Washington on the congress and legislation level who were pro oil and gas and pro energy dominance all over the world and sees President Joe Bidens administration as a formidable foe due to his stopping the Keystone Pipeline and looking towards a greener, more environmentally safe future. I mean, (Bidens administration) has done everything you can think of so far to disrupt us, Christian said. It now costs three times the amount for energy for consumers with what theyve done. It puts more locomotives on the railroad tracks which are three times the cost. But Warren Buffetts company makes a lot of money from it. Then theres the Paris Accord, which were paying $78 billion for. Thats 10 trillion a year for the United States. As youre all aware that we now are living under that little darlin, and weve got to live under that for a term. Christian sites the carbon taxes along with rising fees and permitting is hurting the oil and gas energy more than most people realize. We dont need any new taxes and this carbon tax is going to be one that tries to dissuade the use of oil and gas, Christian said. So, theres a lot of challenges coming from the administration this next year so weve got to come together with some efforts to fight this. Christian continued by saying that Texas energy companies need help in their recovery while the president is putting money into renewables like wind and solar power. When the sun dont shine or the wind dont blow, we let the pilot light go out on our dependables, Christian said. Theyve spent over 7 billion in just state tax dollars to get power lines out to the windmills when we put them in, and then weve been spending about a billion to a billion and a half  thats with a B  on it a year since then, and making sure that you buy, wind energy and solar energy before you buy natural gas energy.

Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn LANSING, Mich. (WJRT) - A former employee from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy is accused of embezzling more than $850,000 from gas and oil drilling bonds. The 49-year-old former environmental qualityspecialist is charged with three counts of embezzlement over $100,000, four counts of uttering and publishing and one count of using a computer to commit a crime. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The Michigan Attorney Generals Office says the employee was in charge of paying back bonds, which anyone drilling for natural gas or oil in the state is required to provide as part of the permitting process. The owner gets the bond money back when the well changes hands.

State officials learned of the allegations in September and asked Michigan State Police to investigate.

For example, during the company's second quarter conference call David Rosenthal, head of investor relations, highlighted Exxon's efforts off of Russia's Sakhalin Island. A new platform there ""set a world record for installation of the heaviest integrated topside structure, weighing over 42,000 tons and using the world's largest ocean-going barge to carry and then set the structure."" The platform, the Berkut, ""is now the largest offshore oil and gas production platform in Russia."" This is a clear display of ExxonMobil's technological capabilities, but also an example of the lengths needed to find new oil. And then there's the recently announced drilling taking place in the Kara Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean, above Siberia. This particular effort involved Exxon being dragged on stage with Russian President Vladimir Putin and being called an ""old and reliable partner."" (Source: Apuldram, via Wikimedia Commons) Why is drilling in Russia such a big deal? First, because both of these projects are in difficult-to-drill locations. Second, because Russia is a difficult nation to do business with. It is, for example, currently facing the Western world's ire over its moves in Ukraine -- including energy industry sanctions. So not only is Exxon working in difficult waters, it's also swimming with the sharks. Mexico, a friendly neighbor That's why the opportunity for energy industry giants like Exxon and BP to lend a helping hand to Mexico is such a great opportunity. Everyone ends up a winner. Mexico gets to reverse the downward trend in its oil production -- a really big deal since revenues from Petrleos Mexicanos accounted for nearly a third of the Mexican government's revenues last year. Oil giants, meanwhile, are gaining access to valuable reserves from which they were once barred. And they get to work in a well-known region with a reliable partner that is close to good customers like the United States. Keep an eye on the oil deals that come out of Mexico. They will be big news for the country and could be even bigger news for the oil companies that sign them. Reuben Brewer has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Seadrill.

These three investments offer a safe way to earn double-digit yields on companies with great prospects for future growth. UNKNOWN:LNCO.DL ) are two sides of the same coin. Linn Energy is an MLP while Linn Co is a traditional corporation structured as a holding corporation for units of the MLP. The distributions of Linn Energy are what pay the dividends of Linn Co. The reason for this odd setup is that MLPs have inherent tax benefits but also tax preparation headaches. Both investments share the same assets and investment thesis. Linn Energy is the largest independent E&P (exploration and production) MLP in America. It achieved its immense scale through a track record of disciplined and well executed accretive acquisitions (60 since its 2006 IPO, worth a total $15 billion). The investment thesis for this partnership (and Linn Co) is composed of two parts. First, the price has recently taken a pounding due to allegations by Barron's magazine that the company has been misrepresenting its expense accounting. These allegations are being investigated by the SEC and are likely to be found false but the sharp drop in unit/share price has badly hurt the company. Its most recent (and by far largest) acquisition of Berry Petroleum was  done with Linn Co shares. The original terms of the deal were 1.25 Linn Co shares/share of Berry Petroleum. Due to the price drop (as well as price increase of Berry due to a record quarterly report), management was forced to increase the offer to 1.68 shares and the total cost rose to $4.6 billion. This threatened the accretive nature of the acquisition and created one additional problem for the partnership/company. Berry Petroleum increased Linn's production by 30% (and doubled oil production). Oil is a much less volatile commodity than natural gas and so Berry's oil-rich Permian assets were a great addition to Linn Energy's portfolio. However, to increase production further would require expensive horizontal drilling and with the cost of the acquisition already greatly increased, management was forced to cut distribution coverage guidance for 2014 to 1. The market, fearful of an insecure distribution (10.4% yield for Linn Co, 10% Linn Energy), has deeply discounted Linn Energy (now trading at a 27% discount to the value of future cash flows from its oil/gas in the ground). However, the concern over the security of the distribution is overblown for three primary reasons. First, management is guiding for 3%-4% organic growth in production while cutting capital expenditure (capex) by 11%. This will improve cash flows and strengthen distribution security. Next, management is always on the look out for accretive acquisitions (which immediately improve distributable cash flow/unit). In 2014 alone, management has screened 48 potential purchases and bid on six (worth $5.5 billion). Accretive acquisitions are likely in 2014 given the partnership's acceleration in recent acquisitions ($11 billion since 2010). Such acquisitions will further secure the distribution. Finally management is exploring options to sell/trade some of its Midland basin assets (that would require expensive drilling to bring online) for assets that are already producing oil/gas. This would be immediately accretive to DCF and lower overall production costs for 2014, further improving distribution security. Breitburn Energy Partners NASDAQOTH:BBEPQ ) is another undervalued E&P MLP. A large impairment charge in the last quarter coupled with severe weather resulted in its distribution coverage ratio declining to 0.93, making the market nervous about the security of its high yield. Once more, I believe these fears to be overblown due to two factors. First, management is guiding for 36% EBITDA growth on the back of 27.5% production increases from its most recent acquisitions. This production is aggressively hedged at very favorable rates (76% of 2014 production hedged at $93.7/barrel oil, $4.95/Mbtu gas). This ensures high and predictable cash flow from which to pay the 9.8% distribution. Second, management is guiding for $600 million in accretive acquisitions in 2014 (on top of $1.2 billion in 2013). Last year's acquisitions increased the partnership's oil exposure and future purchases are likely to be similar. The combination of surging EBITDA and accretive acquisitions means that the distribution is not only safe, but likely to grow at its historic 3%-4% CAGR (2013 growth of 4.8%). Foolish takeaway A principle of Foolish investing is to buy quality companies with promising futures during short-term hiccups in the growth story and when they are most hated by the market.

932,Is the Market Wrong About Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation?  -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 13:37:00,"Cabot Oil & Gas underperformance this year, combined with its exceptional production growth prospects and industry-leading cost structure, make it a compelling buy. May 26, 2014 at 2:37PM Cabot Oil & Gas NYSE:COG ) , the Marcellus-focused natural gas producer, was one of the best-performing energy stocks last year, with shares surging nearly 60% over the course of 2013. But the stock has fallen 5% to date in 2014, even as shares of natural gas-focused peers Southwestern Energy, EQT, and Range Resources have risen by 15%, 16%, and 8%, respectively, since the beginning of this year. Given Cabot's exceptional operational capabilities, industry-leading low-cost structure, and significant prospects for production, earnings, and cash flow growth, I think its exclusion from the rally among Marcellus-focused gas producers is unwarranted and that its shares present strong value. A Marcellus shale gas drilling site in Lycoming County, Pa. Photo credit: Flickr/ . A truly exceptional operator Cabot is essentially a pure-play natural gas producer; its primary asset is located in Pennsylvania's Marcellus shale, though it also operates oil-rich acreage in Texas' Eagle Ford shale. Over the past few years, the company has consistently delivered exceptional growth in production and reserves, while maintaining what is arguably the lowest cost structure in the industry. Cabot's first-quarter average production surged 34% year over year to 119.9 billion cubic feet equivalent, or Bcfe, while year-end 2013 reserves jumped by 42% to 5.5 trillion cubic feet equivalent, or Tcfe. Meanwhile, first-quarter total cost per unit was $2.66 per Mcfe, down 19% from $3.29 a year earlier. As a result, Cabot is now now generating pretax returns that easily exceed 100% at a wellhead gas price of just $3 per MMBtu. By comparison, Range Resources (NYSE: RRC) , another low-cost Marcellus producer, needs a gas price of $4 per MMBtu to generate returns of 96%-106%, while Chesapeake Energy ( NYSE:CHK ) earns a 117% rate of return from its northern Marcellus wells at a gas price of $4 per MMBtu. Ultra Petroleum ( NASDAQ:UPL ) was only generating a rate of return of 25%-50% in the Marcellus, which is why it shifted focus to higher rate-of-return opportunities in Wyoming's Jonah and Pinedale fields and Utah's Uinta Basin. Improving returns and strong production growth, combined with higher natural gas prices, enabled the company's adjusted net income to surge 102% to $109.7 million, or $0.26 per share, during the first quarter, while operating cash flow increased 17% year over year to $255.4 million and discretionary cash flow jumped 27% to $319.5 million. Indeed, the company is now generating free cash flow for the first time in five years and expects to do so in 2015 even with relatively conservative commodity price assumptions of $90 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate crude and $3.50 per MMBtu gas. Wide Marcellus differentials a near-term concern Despite this exceptional performance and expectations for 30%-40% production growth this year and 20%-30% in 2015, Cabot's shares are slumping. In addition to the company's seemingly lofty valuation, investors are likely concerned about wide price differentials in the Marcellus due to insufficient takeaway capacity. But this should prove solely a near-term concern. With the massive Marcellus infrastructure build-out underway, Cabot's takeaway capacity is set to improve sharply over the next few years. The company has already secured 850,000 MMBtu per day of firm capacity on Transco's Atlantic Sunrise expansion project, which is operated by Williams Partners ( NYSE:WPZ ) and is slated to go into service in 2017, and 500,000 MMBtu per day of capacity on Williams' Constitution Pipeline, which is expected to go into service in 2015. These projects, combined with expansions of the other main pipelines that Cabot uses to ship its gas -- Kinder Morgan's Tennessee Gas Pipeline 300 Line and the Millennium Gas Pipeline -- should result in lower Marcellus basis differentials and allow the company to ramp up production to as much as three Bcf per day by the end of 2016. Investor takeaway Cabot's underperformance so far this year is likely due to a combination of valuation concerns and near-term fears about Marcellus pipeline takeaway capacity. But given the company's exceptionally strong prospects for production, earnings and cash flow growth, and improving pipeline takeaway capacity from the Marcellus, I think Cabot's shares no longer look pricey at roughly 22 times forward earnings and may still have significant room to run.

933,3 Reasons to Buy Cabot Oil & Gas  -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 13:00:00,"Cabot Oil & Gas industry-leading cost structure, dominant position in the Marcellus shale, and exceptional growth prospects make it an attractive investment opportunity. Sep 19, 2013 at 2:00PM Houston-based Cabot Oil & Gas ( NYSE:COG ) , an independent oil and gas producer with a large acreage position in the Marcellus shale, recently had an exceptional quarter from both an operational and financial perspective  the best in the company's history, in fact. Well, the market has quickly caught on, sending shares of Cabot soaring to an all-time high near $40 a share on September 3. But despite the run-up in the company's stock price, Cabot may still present an attractive opportunity for growth-minded investors. Here are three reasons why. Solid growth in production and reserves Over the past few years, Cabot has been aggressively growing both reserves and production. From 2010 to 2013, its compounded annual production growth rate averaged a whopping 45%, while its reserve growth from 2009 to 2012 was a similarly impressive 23%. As of year-end 2012, the company boasted proved reserves totaling 3.8 trillion cubic feet. Looking ahead, the company is guiding for 2013 production growth in the range of 44%-54%, up from a previous guidance range of 35%-50%. Based on the midpoint of this guidance, Cabot is now looking at a three-year production CAGR of about 45%. Given that processing and takeaway capacity in the Marcellus is expected to improve dramatically over the next few years, that target doesn't look all that outlandish to me. Industry-leading low cost structure That leads me to the second reason why I like Cabot  it has an industry-leading low cost structure. Cabot's CEO, Dan Dinges, was quick to point out just how profitable the company's Marcellus operations are, despite the poor basis differentials for Marcellus gas. ""Even assuming a 10% to 15% differential at current prices, our typical Marcellus well, defined as a 14 Bcf average, provides a 120% return,"" he remarked during the company's second-quarter earnings conference call. Part of the reason why Cabot's Marcellus operations are still profitable at sub-$4 per Mcf gas is its extremely low drilling finding and development (F&D) costs. In 2012, Cabot's drilling F&D costs came in at $6.28 per BOE to a study by Howard Weil, an energy investment boutique. In fact, of all the companies Howard Weil analyzed, only four  Ultra Petroleum (",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/09/19/3-reasons-to-buy-cabot-oil-gas.aspx

On the other hand, Kodiak's wells have some of the lowest drilling timesin the Bakken -- it may simply be able to move toward a less-rushed timetable as its resource base widens, without enacting any major technological changes. Kodiak hasn't quite won the market's respect yet, as more than 10% of its shares were sold shortat the end of 2012. That number's at 12% as of this writing, which points to continued uncertainty over the company's ability to control costs as it grows.

938,Peace in the South China Sea Is Vital for the Oil and Gas Industry -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 11:59:00,"A third of all seaborne oil travels through the South China Sea, as well as more than half of global liquefied natural gas. ) Apr 14, 2013 at 12:59PM Regional geopolitical disputes are increasingly becoming international economic issues thanks to our global economy. At first glance, rising tensions in the South China Sea would appear to be no more than a fishing dispute. However, some see this situation as one surrounding supposed gas and oil reserves under the sea. That, however, is in conflict with some reports that state that there are negligible reserves to be found in the disputed areas. Even if the potential energy reserves are what's behind the current squabble, it probably won't be something that's solved anytime soon. That could mean future flare-ups that affect the energy industry beyond the resources that may or may not be under the sea. So as China, Vietnam, and others debate the territorial rights of two certain islands in the region, let's look at how future incidents might have the potential to affect the global energy trade. According to the Energy Information Administration, 15 million barrels of oil per day, or a third of all seaborne oil, traveled through this region in 2011. That puts it nearly on par with the higher-profile Strait of Hormuz, which is responsible for more than 17 million barrels per day. If this situation here were to boil over, it could have a significant impact on the flow of oil through the sea, given China's military might. As important as the region is for the oil trade, it's also responsible for more than half of the global liquefied natural gas, or LNG, trade. With growing demand for natural gas in Asia, this dispute could become a big problem for LNG exports from places such as Africa and Australia, while putting exports from North America at a competitive advantage. Take a look at the following map, and I'll explain what I mean. Source: Energy Information Administration. In 2011, Africa shipped 0.3 trillion cubic feet, or Tcf, per day, while while Australia shipped 0.9 Tcf. However, those numbers are probably headed much higher in the future. Energy companies are spending billions to develop new LNG export facilities designed to tap these highly profitable Asian markets. For example, Anadarko Petroleum NYSE:ACP ) recently joined forces with Eni on a major LNG export facility in Mozambique. The project is designed to support Anadarko's major natural gas find off the coast. The partners expect the project to begin exporting gas by 2018. While that's a long way off, geopolitical disputes tend to be recurring themes. Moving over to Australia, ConocoPhillips ( NYSE:COP ) is moving forward on a major LNG export facility. The company expects to begin exporting in mid-2015.

Dec 14, 2013 at 12:00PM This article was written by Oilprice.com , the leading provider of energy news in the world. One oil and gas worker is killed on average every three days, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, which shows a spike in industry fatalities coinciding with the shale ""revolution"", while non-fatal accidents have reached a five-year high. Oil and gas workers' deaths have reached an all-time high, according to the Bureau, with the industry registering fatality rates up to seven times higher than for private employees across other industry sectors, while the deadliest occupations remain agriculture, fishing and forestry. ""Job gains in oil and gas and construction have come with more fatalities, and that is unacceptable,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez in August. According to a report from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , 40% of oil and gas industry fatalities are the result of transportation accidents, largely due to the fact that oil and gas truck drivers are pressured to work longer hours than in other industries. Loopholes in highway safety rules allow oil and gas truck drivers to drive more than 20 hours in one shift, often transporting dangerous materials, according to the , which also published a 2011 document from the National Transportation Safety Board rejecting the idea of special rules for the oil and gas industry. Also chiming in on the issue is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has noted that the fatality rate in the industry has increased in tandem with growing numbers of inexperienced workers, longer working hours and truck fleets that are aging. During a recent webinar followed by the Pittsburg Post-Gazette, Ryan Hill, program manager for the Western States Office of NIOSH (The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health), noted that half the oil and gas workers involved in traffic accidents were not wearing seat belts. ""Operating a vehicle in the oil and gas industry presents a unique hazard,"" Hill was quoted as saying. Driving often takes workers into rural, isolated areas, where gravel roads ""lack many of the safety features on highways."" Hill also noted a rise in fatalities due to falls, fires and explosions. Last year, the report notes, nonfatal accidents jumped as well, from a five-year low of 1,400 in 2011 to a five-year high of 2,600. The Bureau has been keeping track of these statistics since 1992, and the estimate of one oil and gas industry death every three days is for 2010, 2011 and 2012. The statistics, however, exclude fatalities in the state of Pennsylvania for 2012, while the state registered four related deaths in 2011.

947,How This Oil and Gas-Focused Company Plans to Aggressively Grow Earnings -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 09:32:00,"This industrial company looks set to increase revenue and margins in the coming year. Here's what you need to know before buying its stock. YCharts. Will Dover Corp make the numbers? That said, the question is whether management will achieve its targets in the coming years. The following chart breaks out segment operating profit from 2016 and then uses projections based on management's guidance for segment operating profit in 2019. Data source: Dover Corp presentations, analysis and chart by author. In thousands of U.S. dollars. Simply put, Dover needs oil and gas capital spending to stay in growth mode, and that obviously depends on energy prices. As you can see in the chart above, the big jump in earnings is expected to come from the energy segment. In addition, around 29% of fluids segment revenue is expected to come from pumps in 2017 -- a large part of which comes from the petrochemicals industry. Moreover, Dover's energy segment exposure by end market in 2017 is heavily weighted (67% of the total) toward drilling and production (which is largely dependent on a growing rig count), with the product mix split between 65% coming from core products and only 35% coming from recurring and replacement products. In other words, buying Dover based on its future earnings projections means buying a stock on the expectation that oil prices will at least stabilize. Dover's oil-and-gas-based earnings are highly cyclical. What rivals are saying While Dover's management feels confident in its projection, it's worth considering what its competitors like General Electric Company ( NYSE:GE ) are saying. (For reference, Dover competes with GE/Baker Hughes and others for around 78% of its forecast 2017 energy revenue.) In one of his last presentations as CEO, Jeff Immelt sounded a note of caution concerning GE's oil and gas outlook. ""We see orders improving, but it's off a low base. So I still think we have to underwrite caution in that space."" His comments served as a reminder that GE's oil-and-gas-based revenue continually failed to meet expectations in 2016. The bottom line All told, Dover's investor presentation contained a lot of promise for investors, but based on GE's commentary and Dover's heavy exposure to the cyclicality of oil and gas capital spending, it's far from a given that Dover will meet its numbers by 2019. In short, the stock is attractive if you like the outlook for oil prices and want some exposure to energy, but worth avoiding if you aren't confident in the future of energy prices. has no position in any stocks mentioned.

948,3 Small-Cap Oil and Gas Stocks You Should Be Watching -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 09:31:00,"Resolute Energy, TransGlobe Energy, and Contango Oil & Gas are three small-cap oil and gas producers that look undervalued based on their reserves. . But where to look? When trying to identify potential E&P plays, I like to use two main valuation methods. First, the enterprise value to reserves figure, or EV/reserves, which gives an indication of what value the market is placing on each barrel of the company's reserves. Generally, this figure can be compared to the rest of the industry or the company's close peers to get an indication of whether or not the company is undervalued. Second, I like to use the PV-10 ratio. This figure helps us understand how much the company's oil reserves will be worth over the life of the project, minus 10% as a discount rate to account for items such as inflation and taxation. PV-10 attempts to show us the future value of all of the reserves held by the company, net of extraction expenses. So, let's take a look at some seemingly undervalued oil minnows and try to establish their worth. North America I came to the conclusion in a previous article that domestic E&P companies now look relatively overvalued in comparison to their international peers, as the domestic oil boom has sent valuations skyrocketing. However, Resolute Energy seems to have bucked the trend. As of December 2012, Resolute's reserves totaled 78.8 million barrels of oil equivalent. Using the present value method, the company's engineers estimate that the pre-tax value of these reserves was $1.1 billion at year-end 2012. In comparison, Resolute's enterprise value currently stands at $1.3 billion. As you can see here major oil and gas companies tend to trade at a significant premium to the value of their reserves. If we divide Resolute's enterprise value of $1.3 billion by its reserve figure, we get an EV/reserve figure of $16.50. In comparison, U.S. oil market leader EOG Resources is trading at an EV/reserve figure of $28, and Pioneer Natural resources has an enterprise value of $26 billion while the PV-10 value of its reserves is only $8.3 billion, based on the most recent data . The Middle East TransGlobe Energy is another small fish that appears cheap at face value. However, the majority of the company's operations are in Egypt, which is a highly unstable region at present. That said, Egypt's instability started back during 2011 and as of yet, TransGlobe's operations have not been affected. Still, it seems as if TransGlobe is trading at a significant discount to the value of its reserves. This leads me to believe that this discount could mitigate some of the risks that investors would be taking on due to TransGlobe's geographical location. Indeed, at the end of fiscal 2013, TransGlobe had 45 million barrels of gross proved plus probable oil reserves. The company's engineers reckon that these reserves have a PV-10 value of $615 million, 42% more than the company's current enterprise value of $608 million . Although, if we compute the EV/Reserves figure, we see that TransGlobe is trading at a value of $13.5 per barrel of reserves, which is lower than the figure we got for Resolute but still less than the figures for EOG and Pioneer. Having said all of that, TransGlobe is sitting on a net cash position, so the company does look financially stable from that point of view, and extra financial stability does deserve a premium. Cheapest of all Contango Oil & Gas currently has a enterprise value of $550 million, and it its pre-tax net present value of reserves, discounted at 10%, is approximately $550 million. It does get a bit complicated here as Contango is not strictly an oil company and produces more gas than anything else. Of course, this means that the company's reserves are worth less than those of its peers (gas is cheaper than oil). Contango has proved reserves of 236 billion cubic feet of natural gas, 8.7 million barrels of oil, and 8.3 million barrels of natural gas liquid. All in all, this works out to 338 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent. Translated, and put into simple terms, this implies that Contango's reserves are currently being valued at $1.63 per million British thermal units -- with natural gas currently priced around $5 per million British thermal units, you can see the valuation discrepancy here. Foolish summary All in all, small-cap oil companies can be risky and highly speculative. Nevertheless, if you know where to look and do your research, you can minimize the risk. All three companies above, TransGlobe, Resolute, and Contango, are trading at a value that is below the estimated value of their reserves, making the companies look undervalued with potential for capital gains as the companies monetize their assets. This low valuation also opens up the possibility for takeovers as oil majors buy up smaller peers in an attempt to drive production higher. Rupert Hargreaves has no position in any stocks mentioned.

View Comments One of New Mexicos biggest-employing industries in oil and gas could also be one of the most lucrative sectors to work in, per a recent national study. The report from the Energy Futures Initiative (EFI) and the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) showed the median hourly wage for energy workers across the U.S was about $25.60, about a third higher than the national average of $19.14. In New Mexico, the COVID-19 pandemic threatened up to 134,000 jobs in the oil and gas industry, per a report from the New Mexico Oil and Gas Industry (NMOGA), which represented $7.6 billion in wages.

During the pandemic, energy employment in the U.S. dropped by 12 percent, the report read, compared with a 20 percent dip nationwide. But between June and December 2020, the energy industry added 323,880 jobs from lost of about 1.08 million jobs between March and May of last year when COVID-19 first began in surge in the U.S. More: Local New Mexico leaders defend oil and gas industry amid federal leasing review Wages, Benefits, and Change sheds new light on the role of energy jobs in the U.S. economy, said Ernest Moniz, former U.S. Secretary of Energy and founder of EFI. Overall, the energy jobs sector grows faster, pays higher wages and benefits, and has been more resilient in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest data from the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions published on April 2 showed such national trends were consistent in the Land of Enchantment. Records show that as of February, fossil fuel extraction and construction lost 10,900 jobs in the past year compared with 25,600 in leisure and hospitality.

As the U.S. continues its transition to a low carbon economy, this report together with the rest of the growing portfolio of the U.S. Energy and Employment Reports can inform policies to ensure a just transition for all workers, Moniz said.

The national report follows a study from NMOGA that showed oil and gas accounted for about 14 percent of income generated in the state while adding $16.6 billion to the states economy.

950,Should You Be Worried about Kodiak's Debt Levels? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 09:10:00,"The market has been cagey about the fast-growing companys spending plans. Should you be worried? Aug 21, 2013 at 10:10AM Lately, Kodiak Oil & Gas ( UNKNOWN:KOG.DL ) has been drawing flak due to its capital expenditure program. Management had revised the original spending plan for 2013 from $775 million to $1 billion. Moreover, the independent upstream company has shored up its balance sheet debt levels to meet funding. The market has been wary of this fast-growing company despite strong quarterly results. Should investors be worried? I don't think so. But before delving deeper, let's take a look at what the company's growth plans are for the rest of the year. According to the latest guidance from management, Kodiak aims to complete 100 net wells this year and pull up average daily production to somewhere between 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 34,000 boepd for 2013. Source: Kodiak Oil & Gas Ambitious indeed With average daily sales volumes of 22,500 barrels of oil equivalent for the first six months, production for the second half of the year will have to be somewhere in the range of 37,500-45,000 boepd in order to meet that target. That means production volumes will have to be ramped up 66% to 100% for the second half of the year. Now that's definitely ambitious. To fund its growth plans, Kodiak has issued debt financing. But with debt to equity currently at 130%, the market hasn't so far been enthusiastic about the company's spending program. However, I feel the market is likely missing out on something. Efficiency drives growth More than growth, management's focus seems to be on efficiency. Kodiak has been working on two pilot projects in the Polar and Smokey operating areas. In each project, the company has been drilling 12 test wells within a 1,280-acre drilling spacing unit. The idea is to increase the number of wells drilled within a unit area of spacing. To achieve this, management has been utilizing the highly efficient method of pad drilling. In these projects, a four-well drill pad is being used. This means, each drill pad is capable of drilling four wells simultaneously without rigging up or rigging down after every single well has been drilled. The obvious result is that well costs are gradually falling. Additionally, drilling times have also fallen drastically. Each new well is now expected to cost somewhere in the vicinity of $9.2 million. Compare that to the cost range between $9.7 million and $10.2 million per well in the fourth quarter of 2012. With about 100 net wells to be drilled for the whole of 2013, this translates to at least $75 million in cost savings. Now this might not look too big, but on a per-barrel basis, you can't ignore it. The following chart should give a fair idea how this looks going all the way back to the first quarter of 2011. Kodiak seems to have been doing a fantastic job: Source: Company filings, author's calculations The blue line traces the average price per barrel of oil equivalent that Kodiak has been receiving, while the green line traces the operating cost per barrel of oil equivalent. This is exactly the trend that an investor should be looking for. While prices received per barrel have shown a gradual increase, the very opposite is happening with operating costs per barrel. I calculated the difference between the two values for each quarter: Source: Author's calculations If we look from the second quarter of 2012, margins have been increasing. It's true that these margins were pretty high in 2011. However, from an investor perspective, I would ignore the margins of that year for two reasons: Firstly, crude oil prices skyrocketed in 2011 due to the Libyan crisis. Second, Kodiak was still relatively a new operator in the Bakken at that time. So given these high margins, what's the next step that any reasonable management would want to do? Obviously, it would want to increase production. The pad-drilled wells have so far yielded excellent results. Not only have production costs come down, but the initial production rates have been promising. Am I worried about the debt levels? Not exactly.The best thing management could do right now is increase capital spending and ramp up volumes. Also at the moment, I would prefer debt financing over raising additional equity. Diluting the stock now may send a wrong signal to investors. A fair comparison with Chesapeake Energy? Natural gas producer Chesapeake Energy ( NYSE:CHK ) had been notorious for reaching alarming debt levels, and the story is all too well documented. However, as fellow Fool Tyler Crowe points out investors should be aware that Kodiak's debt financing has been funding direct operations, unlike Chesapeake, which was more interested in grabbing acreage without any immediate development involved. In contrast, Kodiak's management has so far acted within rational limits. With oil-heavy assets in the premier Bakken Shale play under its belt, Kodiak's strategy has so far looked good. Given the fast-growing company's performance so far, I won't be too surprised if this upstream company is acquired soon. With crude oil above $100 per barrel, investors should keep a close watch on Kodiak. Fool contributor Isac Simonhas no position in any stocks mentioned.

951,Perhaps Oil and Gas Producers Aren't Worth the Risk -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 08:45:00,"When it comes to investing in the U.S. oil and natural gas boom, you can go direct to the drillers or you can look at companies that will benefit as a result of the industry's expansion. and El Paso Pipeline Partners ( ) . Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is one of the largest midstream players and has reliably paid distributions to unit holders for years. However, it has been the subject of critical review in the financial press, pushing its shares lower and, consequently, yield higher. That could present a good entry point for income investors. Pipelines and all of the other infrastructure to handle oil and gas, from the well to the electric utility, need to be built before a company like Kinder can use it. For that, firms like Primoris Services ( NASDAQ:PRIM ) are needed. Primoris does everything from building bridges to repairing underground piping. Core to its business, however, are the energy and utility sectors. Both are seeing drastic changes because of the oil and natural gas boom. At the end of September last year, the company's backlog was around $2 billion. The company's revenues were around $500 million in the third quarter, so it's got around a year's worth of work lined up. Meanwhile, it posted record third quarter results. Although construction is cyclical, CEO Brian Pratt noted in the third quarter release that, ""We are in a gratifying stage of the construction cycle."" It might be a good time to take a look. Picks and Shovels There's more than one way to play the U.S. energy resurgence. If buying a driller that is reliant on commodity prices is too risky for your taste, consider switching gears to the companies supporting the industry. That includes companies like Hi-Crush, CARBO, Kinder Morgan, and Primoris, all of which should continue to benefit as the United States moves closer and closer to energy independence.

952,Can These Hedge Fund Oil and Gas Favorites Deliver on Expected Gains? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 08:39:00,"Activist hedge funds have been hard at work on SandRidge Energy, WPX Energy, and Chesapeake Energy, and other well known investors have taken notice. Can these oil and gas companies deliver the returns that the NYSE:CHK ) have all been activist fund targets with other big name financiers also taking positions. Can these energy producers deliver the meaningful share price gains that these influential investors expect? Focusing onshore to boost shareholder value A big believer in SandRidge Energy is billionaire investor Leon Cooperman, the founder of hedge fund Omega Advisors. He feels the company is greatly undervalued. Another hedge fund, TPG-Axon Capital Management, has a similar view and took aggressive steps to try to get the higher value recognized. TPG-Axon's activist pressure gained it a presence on the board and a change in top management. As the executive suite shifted so did the company's direction. The recently announced sale of SandRidge's Gulf of Mexico operations is a major move. The oil explorer is now totally committed to its onshore U.S. fields, where the roughly $1 billion in proceeds from the Gulf properties sale will be reinvested. SandRidge hopes to grow this year's onshore production by about 35% with the funds. That growth will be needed. The company's operating cash flow was down around 16% in the latest quarter compared to a year ago, and oil and gas revenues fell 6%, mainly due to a 13% decrease in total oil and gas production after prior asset divestitures. SandRidge will be relying on its core Mississippian oil and gas properties to make up the lost output. This region, lying across parts of Oklahoma and Kansas, saw recent quarterly production increase about 59% year over year, now delivering nearly 80% of the company's total yield. The stock market appears unsure about the Mississippian's potential, however. Trading at an enterprise value (market value plus debt) of around 8 times expected operating cash flows, the company is valued noticeably lower than ""hot"" shale oil firms like Pioneer Natural Resources at around 14 times or Concho Resources at around 11 times cash flow. This suggests SandRidge could see a higher share price on any good news coming out of its onshore fields. New venues to deliver growth WPX Energy has caught the attention of David Einhorn. The noted investor, maybe best know for his prescient short position in Lehman Brothers before its collapse, has an approximate 2.5% position in the natural gas producer. Hedge fund Taconic Capital Advisors also views the company positively. After announcing its 6.39% stake, the activist firm conferred with WPX management on ways to increase shareholder value. Apparently, Taconic got its point across. In December, WPX announced its CEO would step down and that the hedge fund could fill a newly created board seat. The company's most recent quarter didn't provide management with much defense -- it posted a loss of $114 million, compared to a $66 million loss a year earlier. Stagnating production and weak natural gas pricing were the main reasons for the poor performance. WPX does have some good prospects, however. Discoveries in the Niobrara shale are expected to stem gas production declines. Initial finds have been promising, and the Unconventional Oil & Gas Center ranks the firm's first two producing wells as the best in Niobrara. WPX also has an opportunity to grow in oil. Oil revenues advanced 55% quarter over quarter in the most recent period, and production reached an all-time high. The gains are coming from fields in the Bakken shale, which saw deliveries up 46% year over year. Finds in New Mexico could further boost sales. The company's first nine wells in the San Juan Gallup play showed decent initial flow rates, and the reserve is estimated to have a potential 66 million barrels of oil equivalent. WPX investors appear skeptical. With an enterprise value of around 8 times operating cash flow, the company appears to be trading at a significant discount to leading natural gas producers like Cabot Oil and Gas, whose enterprise value is closer to 17 times cash flow. A higher multiple might be expected once WPX proves its new locations can provide growth. Expecting better returns from reduced costs Chesapeake Energy appears to be a favorite of famed investor Carl Icahn. Initiating a 7.56% stake in mid-2012, since raised to 9.98%, Icahn went to work on unlocking shareholder value by gaining representation on the company's board. Changes began occurring at Chesapeake not long after. Its founder-CEO and six other top executives left during 2013. The company's business tone has also changed. After spending exorbitant amounts on shale properties, Chesapeake has recently turned more cost conscious. The transformation looks to have helped results. Recent quarterly adjusted net income came in at $282 million, a jump from $35 million a year earlier. The focus on reducing costs looks likely to continue. The natural gas producer expects a 20% drop in capital spending and a 25% cut in per-production administrative expense for 2014. It appears the market isn't giving Chesapeake much credit for its new financial prudence. At an enterprise value to operating cash flow multiple of around 6.5 times, the company looks modestly priced. A more generous valuation may be forthcoming as investors get comfortable with the ""new"" Chesapeake Energy. Bottom line Hedge funds have been shaking up the oil and gas sector. Investing in undervalued and under-performing firms, these financiers expect better results, and many will take active steps to make sure it occurs. While an energy producer's success will ultimately depend on its operational performance, hedge fund-influenced companies like SandRidge, WPX, or Chesapeake may now be positioned for meaningful share price gains as long as production growth targets are met.

954,4 Reasons This Gulf Oil and Gas Producer Might Be a Good Buy -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 08:10:00,"Energy XXI shares plummeted recently after its acquisition of EPL Oil & Gas was announced. But the stock drop may have been overdone. Here are four reasons why Energy XXI might be a good buying opportunity. plummeted after its purchase of EPL Oil & Gas ( UNKNOWN:EPL.DL ) was announced, the selling might have been overdone. Factors related to the merger and a compelling valuation when compared to Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold's ( NYSE:FCX ) recently acquired oil-exploration unit suggest the stock price retreat might be an excellent buying opportunity. Here are four reasons why. Making a good acquisition Energy XXI's buyout of EPL Oil & Gas looks like an acquisition that could provide many benefits. For around $2.3 billion, including the assumption of debt, Energy XXI acquires an additional 7.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of annualized production. That production is located mainly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the company already has most of its properties. The centralized location of these oil and gas fields should deliver meaningful cost savings. Overall operating costs can be pruned as duplicate expenses are eliminated. Developmental expenditures will also be more effective, producing more oil per dollar spent via a focus on developing only the best of the combined fields. The transaction also brings more than cost savings. EPL's seismic data and field study abilities should fit nicely with Energy XXI's production expertise. EPL recently committed to $45 million worth of new 3D seismic mapping projects, a critical tool for finding oil and gas under the sea floor. The resulting data should assist in determining the amount of reserves available and which are the most advantageous to develop. While paying a reasonable price The fact that Energy XXI didn't overpay for these benefits enhances the deal significantly. At an estimated enterprise value, or stock market worth plus total debt, cost of around $2.3 billion, the purchase came to roughly $315 per BOE of EPL production based on the latest quarterly figures annualized. On an annualized sales basis, the transaction was worth about 4 times revenue. These valuations aren't a bargain but seem fair. They are very close to what Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold paid for Plains Exploration & Production and McMoRan Exploration in 2013. Freeport, trying to diversify away from its core mining business, obtained an entire oil and gas division with the buys, receiving substantial oil and gas assets in regions such as the Eagle Ford shale in Texas, onshore and offshore California, and the Gulf of Mexico. Paying about $6.6 billion for Plains and $3.1 billion for McMoRan, with the assumption of around $11.2 billion in total debt, Freeport's total cost came to near $316 per BOE of annualized production; that's approximately 4.3 times yearly revenue on an enterprise value basis. Good prospects in the Gulf of Mexico Besides undertaking a good merger at a decent price, Energy XXI's exploration prospects are encouraging. One area of focus is Gulf of Mexico salt domes. Salt domes are large, thick mineral beds that can hold oil and gas reservoirs. Though discovering these reserves can be difficult, they have been known to contain world-class resource amounts. In partnership with Freeport-McMoRan's oil and gas operations, Energy XXI is involved in two promising salt-related plays. The first is called the Davy Jones field, where two wells have already been drilled. The Davy Jones No. 1, drilled to a depth of more than 28,000 feet, logged 200 net feet of pay. That's a hopeful sign since pay is the thickness of a potentially viable reserve base. The Davy Jones No. 2, located 2.5 miles away from the first well, seemed to confirm the field's potential when it found 120 net feet of potential pay in one area and 192 net feet of pay in another section. The Blackbeard East ultra-deep field is another discovery. An exploration well drilled to a depth of more than 33,000 feet indicated the presence of hydrocarbons below the find's salt weld. Still in early days, further testing in the field's upper area is planned for 2014, and actual development of the shallowest zones could happen later this year. The EPL purchase might add another potentially lucrative find. Investigation into EPL's Ship Shoal 208 field began in late 2013 with an exploratory well making a possible oil sand discovery. A currently running test well is expected to provide additional information by mid-2014, and further developmental steps are anticipated once new seismic data has been received. Trading at an attractive valuation Energy XXI's attractive valuation may be the company's most appealing feature, however. On a combined pro forma, or post-merger, basis, the company currently trades at an enterprise value of around 3.3 times its $1.7 billion in expected revenue. On an oil-deliveries comparison, Energy XXI is valued at around $243 per BOE from an anticipated 23.7 million BOE in annualized production. Pricing is noticeably lower than Freeport-McMoRan's 4.3 times revenue and $316 per BOE acquisitions price tag from last year. While some discount may be justified, the current cut appears excessive. Given potential merger benefits, plus meaningful oil and gas discovery possibilities, Energy XXI looks like it could deliver considerable share price appreciation on any sort of unexpected good news. Bottom line The recent sell-off in Energy XXI shares may have been overdone. The company's acquisition of EPL Oil & Gas looks a good one, and its market valuation seems significantly discounted when compared to Freeport-McMoRan's recently acquired energy business. Of course, an energy company's worth will ultimately depend on how much oil and gas it can find. If Energy XXI can deliver -- even slightly -- on its exploration potential, the stock price may react with a substantial rise. Bob Chandler owns shares of Energy XXI Ltd..

Thankfully management teams like those below exist. Many of the most successful tend to have one thing in common: a management team that is transparent about its thoughts behind the reasons for past success and future expectations. This point was driven home last week when I traveled to Houston with fellow Foolish analyst Joel South and our energy sector editor, Robert Coleman The purpose of our trip was to interview some of the top minds in the oil and natural gas space, but what we came away with was far more meaningful than a few quotable phrases or investing tips for you, our valued readers. Far too often, the media vilifies the oil and gas sector and its executives based on a few rotten apples or poorly contrived rumor-mongering regarding the way the industry operates. It's an unfortunate reality, but that's why we want to shed light on those who are truly changing the game for the benefit of us all. This series will give you access to our thoughts on Morningstar's ""2012 CEO of the Year"", one of the most well respected ""wildcatters"" in the space, and a CEO whose company has been revolutionizing the way we understand wells for decades. And let's not skip over a COO with his finger on the pulse of our nation's energy infrastructure, and a CEO transforming an offshore driller into a true growth engine. Over the course of the next few weeks, Joel and I will be publishing content that we assessed as valuable from an investing standpoint, as well as our general thoughts on what has made these companies such standout performers. One thing is for certain: It isn't solely at the top of these organizations. Friendly and intelligent folks could be found around every corner within these companies.

957,3 Technologies at Risk From Oil and Gas' Earthquake Problem -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 07:00:00,"Chesapeake Energy, SandRidge Energy, and the oil and gas industry as a whole are failing to manage the significant emerging risk of induced seismicity. ) Dec 21, 2013 at 8:00AM This week, ranking Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce and Natural Resources Committees sent a letter to the committees' Republican chairs, asking them to hold a hearing on the deep injection of drilling waste and its connection to man-made earthquakes. This request came in response to several recent studies from credible sources that find an increase in seismic activity in certain U.S. regions, and identify the oil and gas industry's injection operations as likely causes. Just a little pinprick ... There are several reasons why the industry injects various materials deep into the earth. Three particular technologies are especially relevant. 1. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, creates a significant amount of wastewater. It's fairly standard practice for fracking companies to dispose of this wastewater by injecting it deep underground. 2. Enhanced Oil Recovery, or EOR, is the process by which carbon dioxide is injected into an existing oil well to force otherwise trapped pockets of oil out of their crevices. It essentially enhances the efficiency and yield of oil drilling. 3. Carbon Capture and Sequestration, or CCS, is an early-stage technology that captures carbon at its point of generation, removes it, and typically stores it underground. CCS is broadly considered to be a critical tool in constraining climate change. All three technologies offer the potential to curb some of the world's most prolific carbon outputs, and all three would be at risk if they were responsible for earthquakes.

958,Warren Buffett's Portfolio: 3 Oil Stocks the Oracle of Omaha Should Love -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 07:00:00,"Energy companies have been a pretty big part of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio for many years, and here's why Magellan Midstream Partners, Core Laboratories, and Helmerich & Payne deserve a spot in the family as well. ) . Magellan Midstream Partners: Is there anything that seems right up Warren Buffett's alley more than a company that generates over 85% of its revenue from fixed-fee contracts, and a large portion of that revenue is also regulated because it has a near-monopoly on the service it provides? That is a pretty accurate description of Magellan Midstream's business. Its network of refined petroleum products pipelines is the nation's largest, and in some places it is the only provider of gasoline and diesel around. This makes Magellan's pipeline system a cash-generating machine that management has used shrewdly to pursue acquisitions to expand into other critical infrastructure projects such as oil and gas terminals and crude oil pipelines, or to find organic growth from its existing network in both petroleum products and crude. What really puts Magellan over the top as an oil stock for Berkshire Hathaway is the company's conservative capital allocation over the past several years. Magellan management has maintained a modest debt-to-EBITDA ratio for a master limited partnership, along with an investment-grade credit rating, all while throwing off tons of cash to investors with a distribution that has grown 12% annually since 2001. With a simple corporate structure that lacks a general partner, unlike other master limited partnerships, the question isn't whether Berkshire Hathaway should buy this company but why it has not already done so. Core Laboratories: Buffett has largely eschewed companies that rely on technology for their competitive advantage, but Core has proven for years on end that it can sustain that advantage in the oil and gas space while generating loads of free cash flow and an unparalleled return on capital. In fact, the company's return on capital employed is more than double the second-best company in the oil services sector and is up there with the best companies in almost any industry. Source: Core Labs Investor Presentation. Over the past dozen years or so, Core Labs management has returned almost all of that free cash flow to shareholders. Not only does the company pay a decent dividend that yields 1.68% today, but management has reduced its total share count by close to one-third since 2003 through stock repurchases. The company is a little smaller than most of the other companies in the Berkshire portfolio and might not move the needle as much for a conglomerate of that size, but it certainly has the credentials. Helmerich & Payne: With horizontal drilling playing an increasing role in the U.S. energy landscape, producers are demanding rigs that have the horsepower to drill longer and longer laterals and the ability to quickly move to the next well. Of all the companies that own and lease rigs, Helmerich & Payne has been one of the best at updating its fleet with rigs that are capable of pad drilling -- drilling multiple horizontal wells from a single location. Even more astounding, the company accomplished a massive turnover of its fleet without taking on high levels of debt. Now Helmerich & Payne has the largest fleets of pad-capable rigs and a squeaky-clean balance sheet that allows the company to generate some of the best returns on capital invested in the oil services space. This means the company can throw off a generous 3.5% dividend yield and still have cash left over that will help it maintain its lead over the competition with a modern, well-maintained fleet. With an $8 billion market capitalization, this isn't exactly a company for which Berkshire would need to swing for the fences, but it could be another strong cash generator to fund that precious float. What a Fool believes Aside from the employees at Berkshire Hathaway, nobody knows if these companies are on Warren Buffett's radar -- although considering the number of annual reports he reads I'm sure he has at least looked at them once or twice. With strong competitive advantages in their respective fields, clean balance sheets, and a solid history of generating cash flow that is returned to shareholders, though, these companies are right in the Berkshire Hathaway wheelhouse and are worthy of consideration for investors' own portfolios as well.",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/05/17/warren-buffetts-portfolio-3-oil-stocks-the-oracle.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004
959,"Bidens Promising, Problematic Plan to Plug Orphaned Oil and Gas Wells",prospect,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 05:20:00,"The proposed infrastructure package devotes $16 billion to cleaning up abandoned fossil fuel development, but it may serve as a bailout for irresponsible oil companies. investigation by Grist and The Texas Observer showed just how stark the situation is, and just how bad things could get. Texas and New Mexico have already identified about 7,000 abandoned wells that were once operated by over 1,000 companies  However, a healthy chunk of roughly 100,000 idled wells in those states could also eventually end up abandoned  The uncertain outlook means that independent estimates of the cleanup costs of Texas wells alone have ranged from a conservative $168 million to a mind-boggling $117 billion . Currently, there are over 109,000 unplugged wells in Texas alone that have not produced any oil or gas in more than two years, an ominous sign of just how many more wells may become orphans and how drastic an undercount current figures are. The financial risk to states and the federal government is much greater in places like Texas and New Mexico, where much of oil and gas drilling, especially fracking, takes place on state or federal land. If producers put up paltry bond amounts and walk away, the financial obligation for cleanup easily becomes the publics responsibility when operators weigh financially unfavorable market conditions and desert their rigs. The average well costs $30,000 to plug and clean up, according to Rystad, a leading energy research firm, with fracking wells costing even more. According to the Government Accountability Office, plugging wells on federal lands can per well. None of those cleanup costs should be assumed by the states, given that they were never partners in the profits. If theres a concern with Bidens proposal, its that throwing $16 billion at the problem, without imposing strict regulations on states for bonding in exchange for taking that money, would create a moral hazard situation not unlike the 2008 financial crisis. Thus, the yet-to-be-articulated stipulations put in place to prevent this program from looking like a blank-check bailout for the oil industry are going to be crucial. SUPPORT THE PROSPECT Oil producers are now in a position where they cannot bail themselves out, said Robert Schuwerk, executive director of Carbon Tracker North America. The question now is does the government give them money to bail them out or does it put other restrictions in place to keep it from happening again? Indeed, there are multiple proposals under consideration, in both the Senate and the House Natural Resources Committee, that would establish some standards, to ensure that companies are financially responsible for their own cleanup and have the incentive to actually plug their idled operations rather than just walking away. But even those are light: One such proposal would stipulate a $150,000 bond per individual well, or a $500,000 blanket bond for all wells in the state. For large operators, the latter would allow them to put up considerably less than the cost of plugging their entire fleet of wells. It remains to be seen what exact stipulations will be in the final Biden proposal. Blanket bonds, in fact, are behind much of the current systems inadequacy. Both Texas and New Mexico have thema flat rate to cover remediation costs for all of a producers wells statewidebut they often fall drastically short of the total bill. In Texas, for example, producers with more than 100 wells must post a bond of $250,000. But the 1,500 oil companies with the highest number of orphaned wells in the state have 63 idled wells on average, which comes out to just a couple thousand dollars per well. That creates a clear financial incentive to orphan them, rather than plug them. Thats part of the reason the U.S. oil industry currently plugs just one of every three wells drilled. Newly orphaned wells, which are more likely to be fracking wells than their predecessors, represent a particularly complex and expensive challenge. Where wells have already been orphaned to the state, it makes sense for the federal government to put local workers back to work plugging orphaned wells, said Schuwerk. But it shouldnt plug wells that are industrys responsibility today, and it should prioritize funds for states that are helping themselves by requiring full-cost, single-well bonds. Without those conditions, industry may perceive this as a reason to not plug its wells. The $16 billion commitment from Joe Biden is both a solid start and an admission of whats a severe and accelerating problem. Its an admission, too, of the failures of the energy policy of his Democratic predecessor. Barack Obama championed American oil production, which was expanded overwhelmingly via fracking, and oversaw the repeal of the American oil export ban. American oil production doubled, which he then after he left office. Many of the wells currently orphaned in the United States predate that policy, but the Biden administrations policy is clear-eyed about what decarbonization will entail, far beyond his former boss. Even as oil prices have returned to pre-COVID levels, the overall trend line is clear. Doing nothing is not an option, but merely raining money on a moribund sector thats actively polluting American land and water while continuing to funnel money to shareholders is also inadequate. Getting off oil is going to be a dirty and pricey business. That $16 billion is likely just the start.",https://prospect.org/environment/bidens-promising-problematic-plan-plug-orphaned-oil-gas-wells/

FRANKFURT  Europe could devote 40,000 km (24,800 miles) of natural gas pipelines to hydrogen by 2040 once production and imports of the alternative fuel take off, transmission systems operators (TSOs) said on Tuesday. Source: Reuters The hypothetical European hydrogen backbone scenario envisages how elements of 2020 green hydrogen strategies at European Union and national level will fit together, said speakers during an industry webcast involving 23 grid operators from 21 countries. On the road to decarbonisation, European policymakers aim for the region to produce, transport and market green hydrogen from renewable energy via electrolysis to replace grey hydrogen from gas, and to substitute oil products across manufacturing industries and in heating and transport. We have found that it is technically possible and economically feasible to use the existing gas infrastructure to create this hydrogen backbone, chief coordinator Daniel Muthmann said during the webcast. It helps to integrate large amounts of renewable energy and it creates the basis for a liquid, cross-border market for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen, said Muthmann, who is head of corporate development, strategy, policy and communication at Open Grid Europe (OGE), a leading grid operator. The TSOs estimate related costs at between 43 billion euros ($51.30 billion) and 81 billion euros. Some 69% of the proposed hydrogen network could consist of repurposed natural gas pipelines, they said. The remaining 31% would be needed to connect future hydrogen consumers in countries with currently few gas grids, but foreseeable high hydrogen demand and production. The TSO report said transportation costs could be 0.11-0.21 euros per kg of hydrogen, which it estimated at a future production cost of 1-2 euros per kg. Sceptics of the hydrogen drive argue that natural gas is not emissions-free and green hydrogen still uncompetitive.

CALGARY, Alberta  Canadas TC Energy on Monday requested information from around 100 renewable development companies to identify wind energy investment opportunities that would generate 620 megawatts of electricity for its U.S. pipeline business. Source: Reuters The capital investment could total about $1 billion, analysts at BMO Capital Markets said in a note. Calgary-based TC Energy owns North Americas largest natural gas pipeline network and operates the Keystone oil pipeline. The company also has a Canadian power business with a 4,200-megawatt capacity, and cited opportunities to grow in that business. The request for projects in the central United States and Texas is open for four weeks from April 10. TC Energy will invite a shortlist of companies to submit requests for proposal. Ultimately, our goal is to leverage our existing asset base to add more renewable generation into our portfolio and the broader market, resulting in a net reduction of emissions across our North American footprint, said Corey Hessen, TC Energys president of power and storage. TC Energy is also looking at ways to invest directly in renewable projects, he added. BMO Capital Markets analyst Ben Pham said TC Energys intent to procure wind energy to electrify part of its U.S. pipeline business supports its long-term growth targets, and would reduce energy costs.

Investors in Santos STO.AX overwhelmingly opposed a resolution that would have pushed the company to spell out moves to wind down its oil and gas operations to help curb global warming,  according to proxy votes shown at the annual meeting. Shareholders in rival Woodside Petroleum WPL.AX will vote on the same resolution, proposed by activist group Market Forces, later on Thursday. ""Santos does not intend to close down its oil and gas operations as doing so would be against the interests of shareholders and would not be consistent with global climate and human development goals,"" Santos Chairman Keith Spence said at the annual meeting, held online. More than 86% of the proxy votes cast ahead of Santos' annual meeting were against the resolution, with 13.28% in favour. Market Forces, nevertheless, took heart from the votes in favour of its resolution. ""With today's vote almost doubling the previous record set for a fossil fuel wind up resolution, all coal, oil and gas producers must take note: investors are increasingly willing to demand drastic action to align with global climate goals,"" Market Forces campaigner Will van de Pol said. Although the votes were disclosed, its resolution was not put to a vote as it required shareholders to approve a move to amend the company's constitution first. Proxy votes were 94.4% against amending the constitution. Santos and Woodside initially also faced climate resolutions from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), working with British hedge fund manager Chris Hohn's Say on Climate campaign. ACCR withdrew its resolutions after both companies agreed to put their climate reporting to a vote at their annual meetings in 2022. In contrast to Europe's oil majors, Santos and Woodside are not chasing renewable energy, but instead are looking to develop hydrogen production and plan to offset their carbon emissions through tree planting or carbon capture and storage (CCS). ""Hydrogen with CCS will ultimately eliminate our emissions, and that's our plan,"" Spence told shareholders.

Forum on galamsey a complete waste of resources  Steve Manteaw Listen to article Chair of the Civil Society Platform on Oil and Gas, Dr Steve Manteaw has expressed disappointment in the government for organizing yet another national consultative dialogue on illegal small scale mining (galamsey). Dr Manteaw explained that several consultative fora had been organized in the past yet nothing concrete came out of those engagements. He told TV3 after Day One of the Consultative Forum on galamsey in Accra on Wednesday April 14 that I am disappointed because of the money we have wasted on holding consultative forums such as this. We have spent a lot of money organizing public consultations in Tarkwa on a programme that was dubbed MIIP. We didnt see much come out of that consultative forum then it transitioned to the ASM formalization programme. Again, we havent seen much of the ASM formalization programme and then we introduce a new consultative dialogue into the framework. It gets a bit confusing. It creates the impression that we are really not committed in dealing with the problem. Dr Manteaw further asked President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to punish persons in his government and party who are neck-deep in illegal small scale mining activities (galamsey) in the country. Until that is done, he said, the country will not make strides in ending the galamsey menace. He said Almost everybody who had a role to play in stemming illegalities in the mining sector were themselves players in the sector, they were themselves people who actually were involved in the illegalities. As a result of that it was difficult to hold people to account. I consider that the president is the person with the ultimate power and authority in this country and until he demonstrates that he has the political will to deal with highly placed people in his government and his party who gets involved in illegal mining we wont go anywhere. Meanwhile, President Akufo-Addo has said that he is resolute in enforcing the laws on galamsey in the country. He said this while delivering a speech at the National Dialogue on Small Scale Mining Wednesday April 14. I am determined to enforce the laws on illegal mining no matter the subject, high or low. I will, however, not act on hearsay or mere allegations without more. I will not hesitate to act though where the evidence is hard before the police. And I will do so irrespective of the standing of the person or persons involved. That is the true meaning of equality before the law, he stressed. There are aspects of our national life which are of first subject matters of partisan politics . We must however come to the understanding that small scale mining with the requirement to do away with the illegalities in that sector should be beyond partisan politics . Some subjects simply cannot be part of our everyday politicking and I use this forum to insist that illegal small-scale mining and matters relating to it should be one of such issues requiring national efforts, he said. ---3news.com",https://www.modernghana.com/news/1074913/forum-on-galamsey-a-complete-waste-of-resources.html

Rockin' the Bakken It was of course the Bakken boom that ignited North Dakota's economy and sent its unemployment rate to the lowest level of any state (Texas is 17th on the list at 6.4% unemployment). It also happens to be one of the few states with a budget surplus. An oil and gas boom in California would go a long way to shoring up its chronic fiscal problems and pension woes, let alone leading the U.S. in surpassing Saudi Arabia as the top oil producerin the world. The court decision, however, effectively bars any drilling on the contested 2,500 acres leased for oil and gas development until the fracking question is resolved. A fractured future In the fracking process, water, chemicals, and fluids are pumped into wells under high pressure to fracture rock formations. Proppants are injected to prop open the fissures and allow the oil and gas to flow more freely.

Considering California's history with quakes, its nervousness is perhaps understandable.

""The Exploration Advisory Tool, developed in partnership with IBM, uses the latest cognitive search technology to give Wintershall Deas explorationists quick and easy access to relevant subsurface information,"" Wintershall Dea said. Understanding the earths subsurface is a complex but critical task when competing for new exploration areas, the company says. ""The artificial-intelligence-powered Exploration Advisory Tool improves and speeds-up knowledge discovery by extracting information from unstructured data like reports or presentations.

In doing so, it saves Wintershall Deas explorationists significant time spent manually searching for data,"" Wintershall Dea explains. In the gas and oil industry, time is an important value driver, the German firm says, adding that it can take up to 10 years from the acquisition of new licenses to first production. ""Artificial intelligence can help us make better decisions about expected gas and oil volumes in the early stages of the value chain,"" says Hugo Dijkgraaf, Chief Technology Officer at Wintershall Dea. Digital transformation at Wintershall Dea is about enhancing competitiveness and reducing risk.

969,Did This Proposed EPA Regulation Put Oil and Gas Stocks on Notice? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 07:40:00,"Looking to make progress toward its climate change goals, the EPA announced its intentions to slash methane emissions from the oil and gas sector up to 45% from recent levels by 2025. One-third of total American consumption Source: Company disclosures. Both companies have also discussed the potential need to install additional methane leak detection systems to their pipelines under pending legislation from the Pipeline Safety Act of 2012, so investors can't say they weren't warned. Kinder Morgan shareholders even attempted to get ahead of the issue by holding a vote to require the company to file a report on methane leaks from its assets, but the proposalonly garnered 18% approval. Unfortunately, even if shareholders knew the extent of pipeline leaks, it's too soon to determine what it would cost to install leak detection systems across each company's holdings. Newer pipelines are constructed with added safety and monitoring technology, while older pipelines could be lacking leak detection systems. Investors will likely be hearing a lot more on the subject from management in 2015 as the rules are finalized. Even without hard numbers, you're probably wondering, ""Is it really worth the extra cost? How much natural gas can be saved from reducing methane leaks?"" Actually, a lot. The EPA believes the rules can save up to 180 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year by 2025. That's equivalent to 4% of all natural gas used in American homes in 2013, or equivalent to the annual capacity of the anticipated Constitution Pipeline being built by Williams Partners LP to move natural gas from the Marcellus Shale. In other words, investors should cheer the new rules. What does it mean for investors? Unlike the Clean Power Plan, the newly proposed set of regulations aimed at reducing methane emissions up to 45% by 2025 compared to 2012 levels is not an attempt by the EPA to squeeze natural gas players. While retrofitting existing pipelines with remote monitoring sensors will represent an additional cost for the industry in the near term, reducing methane emissions will be a large net positive for oil and gas stocks in the long run. Fewer methane emissions will lead to more profitable natural gas production and distribution. There's no reason to worry, although investors will want to keep an eye on the proposals officially released by the EPA later this year.

U.S. oil producer Continental Resources suffered an oil and gas first-quarter production hit of about 6,000 barrels per day, it said on Tuesday, citing Februarys savage winter storm. Source: Reuters A deep freeze in U.S. central and southern states disrupted power and gas supply and affected oil production, refineries and chemical plants for several weeks. Companies including Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 have all warned of hits to profit from production shut-ins and related costs. Continental expects oil production to average about 152,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and natural gas output to average about 935 million cubic feet per day (mmcfpd). Second-quarter production is expected to be 160,000-165,000 bopd and natural gas output is seen at 920-940 mmcfpd, the company said.

'We have revamped the traditional corrosion coupon and created a smart version that tells us more than just the corrosion rate, sa Gulf Times)  Q atar Foundation Research, Development, and Innovation (QF RDI) along with several partners, has developed a smart version of corrosion coupon to understand more than just the corrosion rate of oil and gas pipelines. 'We have revamped the traditional corrosion coupon and created a smart version that tells us more than just the corrosion rate,"" said Dr Abitha Ramesh, corrosion researcher at Qatar Shell Research and Technology Centre (QSRTC), an anchor partner company of Qatar Science  &  Technology Park, part of QF RDI. The newly developed coupon incorporates three of the most commonly found deposits in sour gas pipelines and can also include an embedded sensor to monitor conditions beneath those deposits, she explained. A corrosion coupon is a small piece of metal, made of the same material type and grade as the pipeline. These coupons are retrieved from the pipeline at specific time intervals, cleaned and weighed. The difference in weight is used to calculate the average corrosion rate which in turn can be used to determine the integrity of the pipeline. These new corrosion coupons are manufactured in Qatar. The cost of manufacturing the first unit was equivalent to that of conventionally used coupons from the US. However, the cost is expected to go down considerably if they are mass-produced in Qatar. A conventional coupon cannot help in the complex scenario where UDC (under-deposit corrosion) occurs. In an effort to tackle one of the most prominent corrosion challenges in the oil and gas industry, a team of academic and industrial experts from QSRTC, Qatar University, Imperial College London teamed up to develop this innovative corrosion monitoring device through the financial support of QF's Qatar National Research Fund. The purpose of having these deposits on the newly developed coupon is to measure the local chemistry (chloride ions, potential drop and pH) under these deposits and to pick up early warning signs that UDC may be occurring. The role of the sensor is to identify potential problems even earlier by detecting local changes in chemistry that are a precursor to corrosion. 'These coupons are retracted every two months for detailed analysis, thereby allowing us to very closely follow changes associated with UDC and its most dangerous manifestation called pitting  a rapid and localised form of corrosion in which cavities or ""holes"" are produced in the material, explained, Dr Ramesh. The smart-coupons developed in this project are expected to make an immense contribution towards the early detection of UDC and pitting. In addition, the sensor in the coupon will be able to relay information in real-time as it detects changes in the local chemistry. Having an online sensor that can communicate this crucial information in real-time will contribute significantly towards maintaining safe operations. Dr Ramesh noted, 'Such early detection of pitting is very beneficial because when pitting starts the rate of pit propagation can be very fast and can have significant impact on the pipeline. The smart-coupons are currently being tested in the field. We deployed the coupons at Pearl GTL - a joint development by Qatar Petroleum and Shell in January this year; if things go as per plan, there is a real potential for these modified corrosion coupons to replace conventional coupons in the near future. 'Internal corrosion in pipelines, if not detected early, can affect the economics of production and processing, threaten lives and cause long-lasting environmental damage in case of failure. We can say with certainty that this novel UDC online sensor will play a significant role in ensuring the structural integrity of oil and gas pipelines not just in Qatar but also worldwide in locations with sour service pipelines, Dr Ramesh added.

Fears of another recession caused crude prices to plunge, taking these stocks along with them. Still, this is not entirely surprising with investor emotion running pretty high for the last two weeks. But this is where Fools should capitalize. Should we worry? Yet, is there anything fundamentally wrong with these companies? I don't think so. In fact, while oil prices have seen a drop, production has been increasing steadily. And why is that? Because the companies know for sure that they will sell whatever they drill. The perfect example here is Anadarko Petroleum, which fell 8%. Record production levels have seen the company register substantial growthin the last quarter. In other words, it's simple economics here. Demand for oil and gas has been growing by the day and it will keep growing.

Show more Credit: Polytechnic University of Saint Petersburg, Peter the Great Underground pipelines that transport oil and gas are very important for engineering communications around the world. Some of these underground communications are built and operated in earthquake-prone areas. The study of seismic safety or the seismic stability of underground pipelines has been an extensive study since the 1950s. Since then, a number of methodologies have been proposed to calculate the stress that an underground pipeline receives during an earthquake. The purpose of these methodologies was to make an accurate prediction about the structural stress that the pipeline receives during an earthquake, and thus will allow the determination of the pipelines elasticity in the first place. It is important to find a correct balance between pipeline cost and structural flexibility. Turns out we were wrong. New research was conducted by scientists from the Institute of Mechanics and Seismic Stability of Installations Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan and Peter the Great Saint Petersburg University of Applied Arts (SPbPU) in Russia. The research showed that the current methods used to calculate the stress received by underground pipelines during an earthquake are incorrect. Current methods do not take into account seismic pressure, that is, the natural pressure at the outside of the pipeline caused by propagation of a seismic wave into the soil. This leads to an incorrect determination of the pipeline pressure; longitudinal stress calculations lead to errors of 100% or more, he said Nikolai Vatin, Professor at the Institute of Civil Engineering, SPbPU. Ignoring linear pressure means that all underground oil and gas pipelines are more vulnerable to earthquakes than initially expected. Researchers have developed a new theory for the propagation of seismic waves in an underground pipeline and surrounding soil to address this problem. The related theoretical material explaining all the mathematical calculations of the new theory and its benefits compared to the previous methodology can be found in the article Wave theory of seismic resistance of underground pipelines. It is really impressive that science is moving forward, we get better theories and find our mistakes. However, the sinister worry is that all of our existing pipelines are at risk will remain for some time until they are replaced and modernized, said Karim Sultanov of the Institute of Mechanics and Seismic Stability.

SINGAPORE -BHP Group Ltd said on Thursday it completed its first refuelling of a ship with biofuel this month in a trial run that is part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Source: Reuters It was also the first time that a ship has been refuelled with biofuel in Singapore, the worlds largest bunkering hub. A biofuel blend derived from certified sustainable feedstock sources such as cooking oil, crude tall oil and sewage sludge was used on April 4 to refuel the 81,000 deadweight tonne dry bulk carrier Kira Oldendorff which was on its way from Australia to Europe. The blend required no significant modifications to the engine or other components, a BHP spokesman said. The mining giant is exploring the use of bunker fuels such as liquefied natural gas and biofuels to replace fuel oil, aiming to reduce carbon emissions by 40% when shipping its products as part of the companys climate change goals for 2030. The biofuel blend used is said to reduce well-to-exhaust CO2 emissions by 80% to 90% compared with conventional residual fuel oils, BHP said in a statement. The spokesman said enough was loaded to trial the biofuel over a number of days, a significant portion of the vessels voyage. He declined to comment on the price of the biofuel, citing a confidentiality agreement. The shipping industry is examining a range of technologies as it looks to meet an International Maritime Organization target of a 50% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 levels by 2050. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie says global demand for oil-based marine fuels is set to fall in the next three decades as stricter carbon emissions rules for the shipping industry kick in and alternative fuel use climbs. The biofuel was supplied by Netherlands-based GoodFuels in partnership with German shipping group Oldendorff Carriers and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. This trial marks the start of a process for GoodFuels of facilitating more structural supply of sustainable marine biofuels in Singapore, in a commercial, operational and technically feasible manner, Isabel Welten, chief commercial officer at GoodFuels, said in the statement.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/bhp-completes-its-first-refuelling-of-a-ship-with-biofuel/

In 2017, President Trump issued an executive order to reverse President Obamas protection of those waters from oil and gas development, a decision Obama was authorized to make under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). Trumps order was struck down in 2019 by a federal judge in Alaska, after the League of Conservation Voters challenged the order in court. The Trump administration appealed that decision. The appeal would have examined the legality under the OCSLA of a president terminating a predecessors withdrawal of specified federal offshore areas from oil and gas development. The OCSLA is not explicit on this possibility. The appeals court confirmed that Bidens executive order on this topic  issued on the presidents first day in office, on January 20, 2021  meant there were no grounds for an appeal; the new executive order revoking President Trumps order removed the basis of the legal controversy, leaving President Obamas restrictions in place.

1006,Two Western Kentucky Men Plead Guilty To Oil And Gas Fraud,fbi,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 16:43:00,"Stacy Scott Phelps and James Michael Harper pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud in connection to a oil and gas drilling business. Thursday, April 15, 2021 Two Western Kentucky Men Plead Guilty To Oil And Gas Fraud BOWLING GREEN, KY.  Two western Kentucky men, Stacy Scott Phelps and James Michael Harper, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud in connection with their operation of Phoenix Development Drilling Corporation, an oil and gas drilling business, announced Acting United States Attorney Michael A. Bennett. According to plea agreements in the case, from approximately January 2015 to June 2016 Phelps and Harper operated Phoenix Development Drilling Corporation.  Through their efforts, the company acquired drilling permits and leases for property in Hart County and Monroe County, Kentucky.  Phelps and Harper put together two drilling programs for Phoenix known as Phoenix Three Select and Phoenix Three Preferred.  They then, directly and through Phoenixs unlicensed agents, solicited potential investors, to invest in the programs, which were unregistered securities.  To induce investors into the programs, Phelps, Harper, and others prepared brochures describing the programs and their offerings.  The brochures included a joint venture and a joint operating agreement representing that Phoenix would use invested funds to drill for oil. Phoenix also offered another investment opportunity, which allowed investors to purchase an Overriding Royalty Interest (ORI) in all of Phoenix drilling operations and guaranteed at least a 6% return on investment in the first year. The ORI agreement stated that the monies invested would be used to further the growth of Phoenix. As part of their fraud conspiracy in the case, Phelps and Harper made numerous false statements to investors.  For example, in the Phoenix Three Select offering materials, which defendants began distributing at least as of September 8, 2015, they described that the main focus of the program was to develop out the proven Lee Miles lease in Hart Co. Kentucky.  However, no wells had been drilled on that lease before Phoenix drilled a single, non-producing well on September 17, 2015.  The defendants also demanded payments from investors for completion costs for the Lee Miles well before they had drilled the well.  In so doing, they falsely represented to at least one investor at least three months before they had actually drilled that well that they had drilled the well, let it sit overnight, and when they opened it up [i]t blew nice quality oil for over 4 minutes. Phelps and Harper further made misrepresentations in connection with the ORI investment opportunity.  The defendants made payments to three investors and represented that that they were ORI payments, leading the investors to believe that the payments were oil production revenue from Phoenixs wells. In fact, they made these ORI payments before Phoenix had even drilled the first well and Phoenix never drilled a viable well or made any revenue from oil production. Finally, Phelps and Harper also represented that monies invested in both the Phoenix Three Preferred and Phoenix Three Select programs would be used for Phoenixs oil drilling operations, when in fact only approximately 10% of the money raised from investors was spent on legitimate business purposes. The remainder of the money raised was moved through Phoenixs bank account and diverted for the use of the defendants and other co-conspirators, which were used by some for personal expenses, including for vacations, golf, jewelry, dating and adult websites, auto parts, gas, groceries, clothing, and online gambling, among other non-business expenditures. During the course of their fraud conspiracy, Phelps and Harper and other co-conspirators sold shares of the two Phoenix programs to ten investors, most of whom resided outside of Kentucky, and sold the additional ORI investment to three of those investors, collecting $556,056.25 in investors money, while paying out only $15,574 in purported ORI payments to the three investors. Phelps is scheduled for sentencing on July 7 th at 9:00 am CDT in Bowling Green before Chief United States District Court Judge Stivers.  Harper is scheduled for sentencing on July 7 th at 9:30 am CDT in Bowling Green before Chief United States District Court Judge Stivers. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Nicole Elver and Stephanie Zimdahl.  The case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The U.S. Attorneys Office also appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ###",https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/louisville/news/press-releases/two-western-kentucky-men-plead-guilty-to-oil-and-gas-fraud

1011,More Options Awarded to the Directors of Falkland Oil & Gas -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 12:39:00,"Falkland Oil & Gas issues options at 28 pence. Jan 2, 2013 at 1:39PM LONDON -- The shares of Falkland Oil & Gas ( LSE:FOGL ) kept steady at 28.5 pence during London trading today after the popular AIM-quoted company revealed its latest director share awards. Falkland, which is exploring for oil and gas to the south and east of the Falkland Islands, said the awards would have a three-year performance period and a 10-year term. Falkland confirmed the ""restricted"" shares it had awarded would vest following the ""achievement of strategic objectives and operating milestones"" during 2013, 2014, and 2015. The firm also said the ""market value"" options it had granted would vest according to the share-price growth recorded during the same three years, with any payout starting at 33% and calculated from 28 pence. Falkland's chief executive, Tim Bushell, today collected 371,429 restricted shares and 742,857 options, while operations director Colin More received 334,286 restricted shares and 668,571 options. Falkland's directors will no doubt hope they will be able to exercise their options in the future. Last year, a bad run of drilling news saw Falkland's shares plunge from as high as 99 pence to 28 pence -- an all-time low. That price plunge currently means the board's options have questionable value. According to Falkland's 2011 annual report, up to 4 million staff options may be ""underwater,"" with a further 1.8 million restricted shares unlikely to have much value due their vesting being linked to the company's share performance. Still, today's option grants may prove valuable one day to Falkland's directors. At 28 pence, the exercise price is well below the group's last reported net cash position of about 43 pence per share , equivalent to roughly 138 million. On the face of it, losing money on 28 pence shares that are backed entirely by cash could be hard to achieve. But whether investors can make any money -- and whether Falkland's directors eventually profit from today's option grant -- is a different story. Ultimately, whether the 43 pence per share cash hoard makes Falkland a buy at 28 pence remains your decision. That said, you can always consult this free Motley Fool report , which explains the factors you need to consider when evaluating smaller oil and gas explorers. The sector has always provided its fair share of multibaggers and falling knives that can persuade even the most cautious of investors to take a wild punt.

1012,Will Kodiak Oil & Gas Beat Out Continental Resources and Statoil in the Bakken? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 12:16:00,"Kodiak Oil & Gas is a major player in the Bakken shale play, but can it stay on top of rivals Statoil and Continental Resources? Earnings Beats in Past 4 Quarters 2 Source: Yahoo! Finance. Will Kodiak earnings make investors happy this quarter? In recent months, analysts have boosted their views on Kodiak earnings, raising third-quarter estimates by $0.03 per share and full-year 2014 projections by a dime per share. The stock has kept moving higher, rising more than 40% since late July. Kodiak has already given investors an idea of what they can expect from its third-quarter results. Last week, it gave preliminary figures that indicated a jump in production of 54%, with expectations that it will end the year at a level almost 19% higher than that. Over the past three years, the company's production has risen almost 30-fold. Equally importantly, Kodiak has learned how to keep its costs down, and improved access to outside marketshas helped it boost the price it gets for the oil it extracts from the region. But like all oil plays, the Bakken has a finite lifespan and some investors worry that the play might run its course sooner than others expect. With the natural rate of decline on shale oil plays being faster than that of shale gas, the current emphasis on liquids could lead to Bakken depletion on an accelerated basis. That has led Continental, Statoil, and Whiting Petroleum ( NYSE:WLL ) not to concentrate all their efforts on the Bakken, and eventually, it could force Kodiak to follow suit if it wants to survive after the region gets tapped out. One huge advantage for Kodiak has come from its use of ceramic proppants over sand. Despite higher up-front costs, ceramics help it get more production from its hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, part of the reason its acquisition of Liberty Resources earlier this year made as much sense as it did is that Liberty had used ceramics in its original fracking operations. Kodiak has also joined Continental in moving to multi-well pad drilling, and the results have allowed Kodiak to boost its completed-well counts while reducing the number of drilling days to complete them. Smart efficiency plays like this will become increasingly vital when production levels in the Bakken start to plateau and eventually fall. In the Kodiak earnings report, watch to see whether the company gives any surprises after its early guidance. For longtime Bakken investors, Kodiak is still firmly on the upswing, and it'll be interesting to see if Kodiak keeps its pure-play status or starts to follow Continential, Statoil, and other players by building up a more diversified portfolio of assets. to add Kodiak Oil & Gas to My Watchlist, which can find all of our Foolish analysis on it and all your other stocks.

1015,Kodiak Oil & Gas Is Getting Ready for the Next Level -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 11:00:00,"After spending billions of dollars on growth, Kodiak is about ready to start delivering returns. Sep 19, 2013 at 12:00PM Kodiak Oil & Gas UNKNOWN:KOG.DL ) has spent billions to build out a premier position in the Bakken Shale. A good portion of that spending has been fueled by debt as the company has significantly outspent its cash flow. To date the company has racked up $1.55 billion in senior notes to go with another $600 million drawn on its revolver. That leaves the $5 billion company with just about $500 million in liquidity. Some read that and might think that Kodiak is in a precarious position. However, that is simply not the case as Kodiak's cash flow is actually now starting to catch up to its spending. If everything goes according to plan, 2014 could be the year that Kodiak runs at a break-even pace. Once that happens, Kodiak has the potential to really fuel some compelling future returns. Kodiak has often been criticized for spending more money on its wells than some of its peers. With capital so precious, cheaper wells enable a company to drill more wells for less money. However, over the long term what's even more important is a company's ability to produce more oil out of existing wells. Kodiak chose to take the long-term approach when it decided to use ceramic proppants instead of less expensive raw frac sand. It's a move that as time goes on should really serve it well. The main selling point of ceramic proppants like those produced by CARBO Ceramics ( NYSE:CRR ) is the higher estimated ultimate recoveries. According to CARBO, ceramics could lead to a 30% improvement in estimated ultimate recoveries. That's a significant increase in the amount of oil recovered, which will also increase the return on investment for the producer. For example, in comparing returns of Bakken producers we'll take a look at top dog Continental Resources ( NYSE:CLR ) . It spends about $8 million per well, which is estimated to ultimately produce about 603,000 barrels of oil equivalent. At $100 oil, that's more than a 60% rate of return. It's solid returns like those that have fueled Continental's rise to the top. Kodiak on the other hand has well-documented well costs that are well above that, currently in the $9.5 million range. However, thanks to ceramics and its location in the basin, Kodiak is estimated to ultimately produce anywhere from 650,000 to 850,000 barrels of oil per well. At $95 oil that yields internal rates of return in a range of 54% to 84%. Those increased recoveries make Kodiak's wells very valuable, especially in a day where $100 oil is likely here to stay. It's easy to take a quick glance at the numbers and consider Kodiak a sub-par Bakken player with its higher well costs and limited liquidity. However, that would mean missing out on the fact that Kodiak chose to pay up to build a premium position, which should prove to be more valuable over the longer-term. Combine that with the possibility that the company could be run at cash flow break even next year, while still growing at a decent clip and Kodiak is a pretty compelling oil growth story. It's a company that could surprise a lot of investors over the coming year. Three more stocks for $100 Oil Fool contributor Matt DiLallohas no position in any stocks mentioned.

1017,The Big Opportunity for Kodiak Oil & Gas -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 10:20:00,"A look at the opportunity ahead for this up-and-coming oil and gas junior. ) , Kodiak faces a host of unique challenges. But there are advantages to its smaller size and unwavering focus on one basin, as well. To explore these advantages, as well as numerous other crucial factors affecting the company, I created a premium research reporton this oil and gas junior. Hopefully, the report should help investors get a better picture of the company's future. It includes opportunities, major risks, crucial areas to watch, and a closer look at the company's management. The following is an excerpt from the report that briefly lays out Kodiak's opportunities and addresses the pros and cons of focusing solely on the Bakken. It's just a sample of one section, but I hope you find it useful. The Opportunity Kodiak's story is quite simple. As the company itself admits, it's highly leveraged to the Williston basin, which encompasses the famous Bakken formation. Kodiak's CEO Lynn Peterson has stated: ""Kodiak is a one basin show at this point. Nearly all of our assets are in the Williston basin, primarily in North Dakota."" Rapid growth in production and reserves Kodiak's growth has accelerated tremendously in recent years, in terms of both production and reserves. The company has been increasing its acreage in the Williston gradually over time. It has nearly tripled its acreage since August of 2010, when it had around 55,000 acres, to 155,000 acres currently. Kodiak's production mix remains heavily weighted toward oil, with 86% of its reserves consisting of crude oil. The PV-10 value of Kodiak's reserves has also improved significantly over year-end estimates from 2011. This commonly used metric represents the present value of estimated future revenues from the production of a company's proved reserves, net of estimated production, and future development costs. Kodiak's PV-10 value has increased nearly 65% over the $850 million PV-10 value as of the end of 2011. And growth in production has been nothing short of remarkable. In 2010, the company was cranking out an average of just 1,290 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Last year, that number rose to 3,920 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And since then, average production has more than tripled, with an estimated 2012 exit rate of 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Benefits versus risks of focusing exclusively on the Bakken Right off the bat, this unwavering focus on one play poses some major risks, yet also offers some crucial benefits. First, let's look at the benefits. The Bakken is one of the most prolific onshore oil plays ever discovered. Since the play's potential was unlocked through advances in drilling technologies, output has soared and continues to rise. In addition, according to a 2008 study by the U.S. Geological Survey, the Bakken may contain reserves totaling 3.6 billion barrels of recoverable oil. While that's a massive number already, some say these figures are far too conservative. A director at the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources recently placed estimates between 10 billion and 14 billion barrels of oil. The expansive play spans portions of North Dakota and Montana, and straddles the border with Canadian provinces Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The Bakken's allure is that it's primarily an oil play, though substantial reserves of natural gas underlie some portions of it. The Bakken sports one of the most favorable gas/oil ratios of any North American play, routinely yielding more than 90% oil. But of course, there's a flip side to the coin. Along with its tremendous rates of production, the play comes with extremely high operating costs. Well completion and drilling costs routinely average more than $10 million, as compared to conventional plays like the Mississippian where they're only around $5 million.

1018,Debt Could Sink This Offshore Oil and Gas Driller -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 09:31:00,"Seadrill's rapid growth during the past few years has been debt funded. However, there are signs that the company's growth could be about to slow. Dec 10, 2013 at 10:31AM Seadrill NYSE:SDRL ) could have a problem on its hands as demand for the company's drilling units could be starting to slow. Unfortunately, if this is the case, Seadrill could be in trouble. Seadrill has been aggressively building up the size of its drilling fleet during the past year or so, buying new, high-spec ultra-deepwater, or UDW, drilling units faster than any of its peers All of these orders have been funded with debt as a major financing component, with the belief that strong demand for drilling units will ensure utilization remains near 100% and the company can service its rapidly growing debt pile. A cold wind However, there could be trouble brewing as Seadrill's peer, Transocean ( NYSE:RIG ) , revealed at the end of November that it had 14 deepwater drilling units coming off contract during 2014, and 39 units were coming off contract industrywide. According to industry analysts, this is an unusually high number of units to come off contract in a single year. Contracts usually run for five years or more within the industry, so it's odd for a whole bunch of units to come off contract at once. Seadrill has five rigs coming off contract during 2014, and Ensco ( ) has eight rigs coming available. Furthermore, according to Terry Bonno, Transocean's senior vice president for rig marketing, the rig business is cyclical and customers often strategically wait for over-supplied markets before pressing ahead with drilling, helping to secure long-term contracts at low rates. Bonno also cited a customer who said recently that there was a cold wind blowing in the rig market, presumably this means that demand for drilling units is slowing. This cold wind could leave Seadrill credit freeze. Specifically, Seadrill's aggressive, debt-funded growth has left it exposed to high interest repayments, as well as the prospect of higher interest rates when rates finally start to move up. Addicted to debt Nonetheless, Seadrill seems to be addicted to acquisitions, the most recent of which is speculated to be Saipem's offshore drilling business. Saipem is a Norwegian oil services company, which counts Italy's Eni as its top shareholder. Analysts estimate that Sapiem's drilling division is worth around $5.3 billion, half of Saipem's market capitalization. However, one thing Seadrill can't be faulted for is its growth rate over the past few years, which has been impressive to say the least. Seadrill has actually managed to grind out sector-leading earnings-per-share growth over the past five years. Still, investors need to start asking the question of whether or not Seadrill can sustain this level of growth without additional borrowing. Seadrill could eventually run out of headroom on its credit facilities, and creditors might soon start asking if the company can sustain its current level of borrowing. Detective work To find out if Seadrill's growth during the past few years is sustainable, without additional borrowing, I want to take a look at Seadrill's return on capital invested. This enables us to compare what kind of return Seadrill is able to achieve based on the company's assets value inclusive of debt, essentially all the money invested in the business. Now it does get a bit complicated here, luckily Marketwatch.com has already put the figures together for us. According to Marketwatch Seadrill's return on invested capital is a tad over 7.4%. In comparison, Transocean's return on invested capital is reported to be 3% and Ensco's is booked at 7.5%. Interestingly, these numbers reveal to us that Ensco is better than Seadrill at generating revenue from its assets; although only just.  On that basis, it is reasonable to assume that without its aggressive borrowing and acquisitions, Seadrill would not be able to grow that much faster than its peers. Foolish summary So overall, it would appear that Seadrill could have a problem on its hands if the market for oil and gas drilling units slows significantly. What's more, it would appear that Seadrill has been able to achieve its rapid rate of growth during the past five years only because it was borrowing heavily. When the company reaches its credit limit, it is likely that Seadrill's growth will slow and the company will have to work very hard to repay debt.

1019,Oil Stocks: Whiting Petroleum Corp Takes Steps to Prepare for an Uncertain 2015 -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 08:30:00,"Whiting Petroleum Corp is looking to improve its liquidity after swallowing Kodiak Oil and Gas. Dec 28, 2014 at 9:30AM Whiting Petroleum Corp NYSE:WLL ) told investors this week that it was delaying the announcement of its 2015 capital spending in light of the volatility within oil prices. That said, the company did announce an update to its proved reserves as well as its liquidity. Meanwhile, it also noted that its taking steps to further improve its liquidity as it prepares for what looks like a very uncertain operating environment as we head into 2015. Let's take a look at what all of this means for the company's investors. Where things stand right now With its deal to acquire Kodiak Oil and Gas closing earlier this month, Whiting Petroleum is heading into 2015 filled with uncertainty. While the company didn't pay much of a premium to acquire Kodiak it did buy the company at what now appears to be the top of the oil market Because of that, the company paid a heavy price as its stock has been decimated by the sell-off in oil prices as well as the uncertainty over what Kodiak brings to the table in this new environment. WLL data by YCharts One of the reasons its stock has been beaten down so badly is because Kodiak brought a lot of debt with it, and that debt could prove to be a big risk down the roadif oil prices don't improve. The deal added $2.2 billion in debt to Whiting's balance sheet, which is a lot considering that the much larger Whiting only had $2.7 billion in debt before the deal closed. We can see the difference in size by looking at the slide below. Source: Whiting Petroleum Corporation Investor Presentation. From those numbers, we can deduce that 36% of Kodiak's $6 billion enterprise value at the time of the deal was debt while just 23% of Whiting's enterprise value was debt. Given the dramatic fall in Whiting's stock price, its debt ratio as a percentage of enterprise value has only worsened since the deal closed. That being said, the company still has plenty of liquidity. The announcement this past week updating the markets on its reserves showed a 29% increase in the combined reserves of the company. These reserves enabled the company to have its credit commitments increased to $4.5 billion, which after factoring out the $1.4 billion drawn on its credit facility leaves the company with $3.1 billion in liquidity. Further, the company's credit rating was actually just increased by a rating agency to Ba1 from Ba2, which is just one notch below investment grade. So, while its debt picture hasn't improved, its liquidity is still really strong. What's next on the agenda? Still, while Whiting has plenty of liquidity at the moment, it's not taking any chances given the current uncertainty in the oil market. The company is reviewing its spending plans for 2015 and says it has a lot of flexibility with its plan so it can maintain its strong liquidity. While this means spending is likely heading lower, the company still plans to deliver moderate production growth next year, so it's not going to cut back too deeply. In addition to reeling in spending, the company is planning to take additional steps to boost its liquidity just to be safe. It's looking to sell assets so it can cut its debt and create another $1 billion in liquidity. These asset sales are likely to be non-core assets, which could come from the 2% of the company's production that isn't from its three core assets, which are noted in the slide below. Source: Whiting Petroleum Corp Investor Presentation. Alternatively, the company does have a very large enhanced oil recovery project in the Permian Basin that it could sell. This asset does provide steady production, but it doesn't offer the same growth potential as the company's shale plays in the Williston Basin or Redtail plays. However, because of that steady production, it's likely to be a valuable asset that could be cashed in if it needed the additional liquidity. Investor takeaway Whiting Petroleum might be entering 2015 with a lot of uncertainty, but the company does have a lot of liquidity to see it through the year no matter where oil prices go. Further, it's taking steps to boost its liquidity by monetizing assets. These steps should ensure that the company survives the downturn in oil prices while also putting it in a better position to thrive whenever oil prices do recover.

1020,1 Oil & Gas CEO Has a Harsh Warning for the Rest of the Industry -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 06:05:00,"Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard thinks the industry is headed for tough times if current trends continue. ) Aug 12, 2017 at 7:05AM Any investor with a financial stake in the oil & gas market is doing themselves a disservice if they don't listen to Schlumberger's ( NYSE:SLB ) management call every quarter. As the world's largest oil services company -- with clients ranging from micro-cap producers to Saudi Aramco -- it can take the pulse of the industry better than any other company out there. This past quarter, CEO Paal Kibsgaard's comments on the direction of the oil market were like an Aaron Sorkin inspired soliloquy. Not only did he lay out a slightly worrisome trend that no one seems to be paying attention to, but he also took Wall Street to task for its support of what he sees is the irrational support of the U.S. shale industry. Image source: Getty Images. If you get a chance, go read the whole thing. If you are pressed for time, though, here are some of the firebombs Kibsgaard threw at the industry and what it could mean for the future of the oil markets. Is U.S. shale production irrational? U.S. oil & gas production has been nothing short of a miracle over the past decade and a half. Think back to 2005-2007. Oil production had slipped to 5 million barrels per day, we were importing more than two-thirds of our total demand, prices were at $100 a barrel and climbing every day, and gas production was on the decline such that we thought we would need LNG terminals to import the stuff. By developing the technology to make shale a commercially viable production source -- thanks, horizontal drilling -- we now have an oil reservoir competing for the largest in the world a natural gas supply that could last a century, and we can produce it at a reasonably cheap price. As great as this all sounds, Kibsgaard wants to throw a little cold water on U.S. shale. He believes that the rapid decline in breakeven prices for shale has led to a wave of irrational exuberance from equity investors that has led to unsustainable growth. The production level from the U.S. land E&P companies which currently represent around 8% of global oil supply is largely driven by the U.S. equity investors who are encouraging, enabling and rewarding short term production growth in spite of marginal project economics. The fast barrels from U.S. land are facilitated by a factory approach to both drilling and production and supported by a rapidly scalable supplier industry with a low barrier to entry. In this market the pursuit of equity appreciation outweighs the lack of free cash flow, net income and return on capital employed for both E&P companies and the service industry. And although the fast barrels from U.S. land have already cooled the oil price sentiments as well as the evaluation of the equity investments themselves, this has yet to limit the investment appetite for additional production growth. Kibsgaard has a point here. It wasn't that long ago -- 2014 to be precise -- when independent U.S. oil & gas producers were taking on mountains of debt to fuel double digit production growth each quarter. The common phrase we heard was ""we'll grow into our debt load."" That ultimately proved disastrous as the price of oil fell from $110 a barrel to just $26 a barrel in January of 2016. We all know how that went over. Since then, producers have become much better at drilling for shale, and many can generate operating cash returns at $50 a barrel. That doesn't change the fact that many are still spending more to grow than what is coming in the door in any given quarter. As it stands, it's an unsustainable and irrational trend to follow. Then again, Allan Greenspan coined the term irrational exuberance in 1996, and it took another four years for the dot-com bubble to pop. So there is no telling how long this irrational behavior can continue. The biggest losers of the ""shale vs. OPEC war"" Nothing sells newspapers or gets clicks more than pitting the U.S. against OPEC. Between the oil crises of the 1970s, the Persian Gulf War, or peak oil back in the 2000s; OPEC and its dominance of the global oil market is an easy target for vitriol. So when America's oil production started taking off thanks to shale, every journalist and their cousin lined up to write a piece on how shale production would impact OPEC and other American rivals such as Russia. Everything was a piece on draining Saudi Arabia's cash reserves or potential instability in the Middle East and how U.S. shale was causing it all. What all of that jingoistic journalism overlooked, though, was more than half of the global oil supply. These sources are the ones have really suffered since oil prices started to crash. Unlike shale producers, the market held these companies to standards related to free cash flow and returns on invested capital. As a result, Kibbsgaard said these companies have drastically cut back on their exploration and development spending. The last book of producers making up the rest of the world today represents over 50% of global oil production and covers a broad and diverse group of IOCs [integrated oil companies], NOCs [national oil companies], and independent operators. In aggregate, this group is for the third successive year highly focussed on meeting the cash return expectations of their shareholders whether these are equity investors or governance. The operators meet these requirements by striving to keep production flat by producing their existing outlets past their normal and by limiting investments to what provides short term contributions to production at the expense of increasing deplection rates. These producers have also benefited from a production tailwind of 500,000 barrels to 700,000 barrels per day in each of the past three years coming from new projects where the majority of the investments were made in previous years. We haven't noticed the impact on these oil producers because their production rates haven't declined much, their longer-term investment projects have become operational, and U.S. shale has stepped in to pick up some of the slack in the market. What we don't see in those numbers is depletion rates. These are the rates at which a producer depletes any given reservoir. Many companies have looked to maintain production and juice returns by getting more out of existing sources. In doing so, they have shortened the window those reservoirs will produce, and future production will decline at a much faster rate. What does this mean for the big picture? I'll just leave it to Kibsgaard to lay it out. [W]ith a low rate of new projects being sanctioned since 2014 this tailwind will taper off in the coming years. This harvesting approach is not uncommon for conventional oilfields that are in their last years of life prior to being shut in. However, this investment in stewardship model is unsustainable for a vast resource space that is both expected and required to provide a substantial part of global oil production for decades to come. Needless to say, the longer the current under investment carries on, the more severe the cliff like decline trend will likely be",https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/08/12/1-oil-gas-ceo-has-a-harsh-warning-for-the-rest-of.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001

CAIRO -The cargo vessel that blocked global shipping in the Suez Canal and is caught in a legal dispute in Egypt is fit to sail once approval is given, its technical manager said on Wednesday. Source: Reuters The Ever Given was declared suitable for onward passage from the Great Bitter Lake to Port Said, where she would be assessed again before departing for Rotterdam, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM) said in a statement. The ship has been in the lake, which sits between two sections of the canal, since being dislodged on March 29. The 400-metre (430 yard) vessel was stuck in the canal for six days, blocking traffic. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said on Wednesday that negotiations aimed at reaching an agreement may take some time. It has made a $916 million compensation claim against the ships Japanese owner Shoei Kisen, UK Club, one of its insurers, said. The SCA has also obtained a court order to detain the ship as discussions over compensation continue. The SCAs decision to arrest the vessel is extremely disappointing. From the outset, BSM and the crew on board have cooperated fully with all authorities, BSM chief executive Ian Beveridge said in the statement. BSMs primary goal is a swift resolution to this matter that will allow the vessel and crew to depart the Suez Canal.

1026,3 Oil and Gas Shares That Soared This Week  -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 23:00:00,"Mediterranean Oil & Gas, Lansdowne Oil & Gas, and Faroe Petroleum all made substantial gains. ) Jul 27, 2012 at 12:00AM LONDON -- Oil prices fell during the first part of this week before regaining lost ground following European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's comments that the ECB would do whatever was necessary to support the euro. Shortly after U.S. markets opened on Friday, the United States Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) was up by 1.5% while the United States Natural Gas Fund (NYSE: UNG) was down by just 0.2% on the week. Despite a broadly stable oil and gas market, some junior oil and gas shares managed to outperform the prices of oil and gas by a wide margin. Here are three of this week's top climbers: Mediterranean Oil & Gas Mediterranean Oil & Gas topped this week's risers, gaining 28% to 12.7 pence. The main driver behind the gains is the news that the decree lifting the ban on offshore drilling in Italian waters has been ratified by the Italian parliament. As a result, Mediterranean is hoping to be able to start production from its Ombrina Mare oil and gas field in the Adriatic -- its operations in Italian waters have been suspended since the ban on offshore drilling started in 2009. Lansdowne Oil & Gas Lansdowne Oil & Gas rose 6.6% this week to 64.8 pence, following an upgrade of the P50 mean oil-in-place estimates for Barryroe, a field in the Irish Sea, from 373 million barrels to 1,043 million barrels. Barryroe operator Providence Resources is now expected to begin looking for a farm-in partner to help fund development of the field and will provide an updated competent person's report for Barryroe by the end of the year. Faroe Petroleum Faroe Petroleum (LSE: FPM.L) climbed 6.5% to 148 pence this week following a positive update from its Cooper well and news that it has doubled its bank lending facility from $125 million to $250 million. Faroe is now performing a drill stem test on the Cooper well, which should provide investors with more definite information about the likely productivity of the well.

1027,What's in Store for Northern Oil and Gas? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 23:00:00,"This non-operated Bakken producer is ramping up oil production in the coming years. 0% Source: S&P Capital IQ. The first thing that's immediately clear is that despite being a small-cap oil and gas producer, Northern has a clean balance sheet. By developing its oil-rich Williston Basin acreage and relying on the occasional equity raise, Northern has avoided debt financing. That can be good or bad, depending on how one looks at it, but one good thing is that the company will not be facing any onerous debt maturities anytime soon. In the third quarter, Northern's average production was about 5,700 barrels per day, a 32% increase over second-quarter production and a 100% year-over-year increase. The company expects a further increase of 25% to 35% in the fourth quarter. That production comes from 525 gross wells (43 net) to the company. However, with 200 gross wells (22.8 net) in the drilling or completion stage, the company expects to increase production significantly as they come online. As a non-operator, Northern has worked with many of the major players in the Williston Basin. Its largest partners as measured by gross wells are privately-owned Slawson Exploration, EOG, Continental, Hess, and Marathon. In other words, many of its partners are quite well-established operators. Northern's drilling success rate has been 100% over 725 gross wells, so the strategy has worked well thus far. Looking forward In 2012, Northern expects to spud about 44 net wells and spend about $325 million in drilling capex. That should add significant production to the 43 net producing wells and the 22.8 net wells currently being drilled or completed. As far as production goes, the company expects to continue ramping up. In 2012, Northern expects to produce double the number of barrels it produced in 2011. In 2013, the company expects a further 50% increase over the number of barrels produced in 2012. As far as its acreage goes, Northern has no material expirations in 2012. Those don't come until 2013, by which time the company expects to have almost 100% of its acreage held by production. At that point, the company hopes to experiment with downspacing, which should maximize the recovery of oil on a per-acre basis. Foolish bottom line With its high drilling success rate in the Williston Basin, Northern should be poised for big increases in oil production in the coming years. As long as the price of oil stays at a reasonable level, the company should be greatly increasing its cash flow in the years to come.

1028,Can Another Tiny E&P Turn a Profit? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 23:00:00,"Abraxas Petroleum is in the black! ) May 10, 2012 at 12:00AM The first quarter of 2012 held good news for many small oil and gas outfits Kodiak Oil & Gas (NYSE: KOG) put its 2011 first quarter net income loss behind it with earnings of $1.7 million. Northern Oil & Gas (AMEX: NOG) accomplished the same feat, coming into the black with earnings of $8.8 million, after a 2011 first quarter loss of $7.1 million. Joining its peers, Abraxas Petroleum (Nasdaq: AXAS) showed up in the black for the first quarter of this year. Last year, the San Antonio-based exploration and production company recorded a net loss of $10 million, or $0.12 per share, but this year things are on the up and up. Earnings Net profit rose to $817,000 on total revenue of $16.39 million, good for $0.01 per share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.69 million, or $0.02 per share. Analysts expected EPS of $0.03 to $0.06, however, so while there is plenty to like with this news, someone, somewhere is disappointed. Production mix in the first quarter was 52% oil and natural gas liquids, and both segments increased over the first quarter of last year. Overall production came in at 3,815 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 3,670 BOE/D last year. Looking ahead Abraxas plans to shore up its balance sheet by divesting assets in two hot regions right now. The company is in the middle of divesting its Eagle Ford interests and has initiated the process of selling leaseholds in Alberta, Canada. Though the divestiture of these assets will hit production numbers, the company did have 10 gross wells come on line in the Bakken during the first quarter, with five additional gross wells being drilled or awaiting completion. It also brought another well on line in Wyoming that is performing well. Perhaps the most interesting part of the Abraxas story is the company-owned rig. It was refurbished and put to work in the first quarter and is currently drilling on a multi-pad well site in McKenzie County in North Dakota. The thinking here is that a company-owned rig run by a company crew provides greater flexibility and cost savings than contracting those services out.

1033,Groups take aim at New Mexico drilling plan amid US review,therepublic,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 20:54:30,"Environmentalists and Native American activists say the Biden administrations review of the federal oil and gas leasing program should result in more protections for an area of northwestern New Mexico that's considered sacred Tweet on Twitter ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.  Environmentalists and Native American activists on Wednesday renewed their demands for more meaningful talks with Indigenous leaders and other communities on the front lines of fossil fuel development as the Biden administration reviews the nations oil and gas leasing program in response to climate change. Several groups shared their frustrations over development on federal land thats considered sacred surrounding Chaco Culture National Historical Park in northwestern New Mexico. The virtual gathering was meant to send a message to the administration as the comment period closes on the nationwide leasing review. The activists said U.S. officials need to do more than just check boxes and instead engage in meaningful consultation with tribes and other groups given that increased oil and gas development has the potential to destroy parts of the landscape outside the park that could provide a better understanding of the ancient civilization that once inhabited the region. They also cited concerns about air pollution from venting and flaring at natural gas collection and processing sites, wastewater leaks and unchecked development in southeastern New Mexico. The culture of checking the box is fundamentally selling out communities, and I think the biggest institutional reform that weve been hearing a need for and a call for is meaningful engagement, said Rebecca Sobel with the environmental group WildEarth Guardian. Communities need to have a seat at the table. We need to be restoring the balance and being a part of the decision-making with a full understanding of the impacts of the industries that are being permitted. The fight over drilling in northwestern New Mexico has been simmering for decades and has spanned both Democratic and Republican presidencies. During the Obama administration, the Bureau of Indian Affairs for the first time joined federal land managers in planning how to manage resources. And following a visit by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt during the Trump administration, oil and gas leasing within a certain distance of the park was put on hold. Legislation pending in Congress would formalize the buffer zone around the park, but even some tribes have disagreed over how big it should be. Much of the land surrounding the park belongs to the Navajo Nation or is owned by individual Navajos. While the legislation would not affect tribal lands, some are concerned they would be landlocked and lose out on leasing revenue and royalties. Meanwhile, leaders with New Mexicos pueblo communities say the region provides a spiritual connection to their ancestors. They have been pushing for a drilling moratorium and have expressed more optimism in recent weeks with Deb Haaland  a member of Laguna Pueblo  becoming the first Native American to lead the U.S. Interior Department. There has been no indication of whether the agency intends to reconsider previous recommendations regarding the areas management plan or if Haaland would consider other actions related to the buffer zone around the park. Julia Bernal, director of the Pueblo Action Alliance, said the tribal perspective should be included in the planning process because the Indigenous nations in New Mexico have a large stake in how our water and land is managed. Members of the coalition also called out New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grishams administration and the Democratic-led Legislature, saying elected leaders across the state have benefited from campaign donations made by the oil and gas industry. They also criticized Lujan Grisham for seeking to offset any economic losses from Bidens directives Lujan Grishams administration has been working on new rules aimed at curbing methane and other pollution from the industry. The  Oil Conservation Commission adopted its rulesjust weeks ago, and separate regulations are being drafted by the Environment Department. Producers also say they have been using technology to address pollution concerns. However, Nathalie Eddy with the environmental group Earthworks said finding pollution in the oil fields is too easy, with special cameras revealing hundreds of instances of operations emitting contaminants. She said the problems span both large and small operators and new and old sites. When it comes to enforcement in New Mexico, the state regulatory agencies are simply no match for the incredible volume of growth in the industry, she said. Were talking about over 58,000 oil and gas facilities in New Mexico and only a dozen inspectors. They simply cant hold the industry accountable.

1034,1 Trend and 1 Opportunity in Oil and Gas You Should Be Watching -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 19:00:00,"An attractive investment opportunity in oil. 1.4% Source: Yahoo! Finance; TTM= Trailing Twelve Months All of these companies have a healthy international services portfolio. From a valuation standpoint, Halliburton looks the cheapest. However, National Oilwell Varco is another solid company which is pretty close behind. Why Halliburton still looks attractive From an operational standpoint, Halliburton's international exposure is just awesome. However, the company has a significant exposure to North American drilling which has slowed down in the last six months due to poor natural gas prices. But I'm not too worried about that. Natural gas prices have started recovering, thanks to increased drilling for liquids. Either way, Halliburton isn't losing out big time. It's too early to turn naysayer. Investors must also keep in mind that third-quarter revenue in 2012 grew a solid 24% from Middle East and Asia year over year, while Latin American revenue grew 18%. North American revenue grew 2%. Now this is impressive, and I feel this is just a precursor to greater growth. In 2011, I was betting that Halliburton would ride big on international projectsdespite being dragged into the Macondo blowout controversy. I still see no reason to change that view.

While digitization and connectivity technology is responsible for great strides in operational excellence and productivity, the merging of IT networks with operational technology (OT) industrial control system networks has also introduced cyberattacks that are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. The SMART approach translates to information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and timely. Responding to this cyber crisis, the National Petroleum Council (NPC) has published ""Dynamic Delivery: America's evolving oil and natural gas transportation infrastructure."" This collaboration among multiple oil and natural gas companies, OT system vendors, U.S. government representatives, and private sector cyber-defense companies and consortiums offers eight significant findings and supporting recommendations to help the industry better respond to cyberattacks. Al Lindseth, senior vice president of technology, process and risk management for Plains All American Pipeline, was a member of ""Dynamic Delivery's"" technology advancement and deployment task group. Lindseth said the group's discussion first oriented around business IT and cyber networks. ""But that's more of a focus on the probability of attack,"" Lindseth said at the online OpEx Cyber Security in Oil and Gas conference in a panel discussion titled ""IT/ OT Convergence in Oil and Gas: The New Cybersecurity Risks."" Lindseth noted attacks on financial institutions' IT networks as an example. ""They're moving trillions of dollars each day across business-to-business networks, across banks and across customer accounts. Their strategies and goals are oriented to their customers' [ability to] manage their own accounts, with all of this happening in a stream-like fashion regardless of what device they're using and where they are,"" he said.

""However, the threat to OT networks is really more a matter of the magnitude,"" Lindseth explained. ""If there's a successful attack on an OT network, it could result in massive economic impact for that company, including environmental, health and safety consequences. ""Ultimately, any program is going to have at its core [the realization] that it's going to be breached. It's only a matter of time. It's when, not if.""

""We serve as an extension to all of our members' security teams, and we take a 'SMART' approach to information sharing, both in the IT and OT world,"" Haun said. The SMART approach translates to information that is ""specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and timely."" Haun stressed the importance of anonymity in information sharing. ""We can develop trust in relationships, and we can share more fully with others because they are protected from being called out as a victim or having an issue,"" she said.

1038,Why Adding Oil and Gas Matters to Freeport-McMoRans Investors -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 13:00:00,"With its massive oil and gas deals now closed, here's why it matters. Jun 24, 2013 at 2:00PM Nineteen billion dollars. That's the cost to transform Freeport-McMoRan ( NYSE:FCX ) from a copper and gold miner into a diversified resources company. It's a move that put it in the same league as Anglo-Australian resource giant BHP Billiton ( NYSE:BHP ) . Unfortunately, we can only speculate right now as to whether this was the right move to fuel returns for the company. What we do know is why Freeport decided to diversify into oil and gas and how the company plans to use it to fuel returns. In adding oil and gas to its portfolio, Freeport picked up a diverse base of assets located in the United States (see the following map). It added both onshore and offshore oil from California and the Eagle Ford and in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as picking up gas assets in the Haynesville, Rockies, and the Gulf. Right now these assets are driven by oil and liquids, which equates to about 90% of the revenue. Natural gas offers long-term upside, but it's not much of a needle-mover today. Source: Freeport McMoRan Investor Presentation One of the keys for Freeport is that its oil and gas business offers visible growth. Although Freeport has a plan to grow its annual copper production to more than 5 billion pounds by 2015, it was struggling to find ways to grow the business beyond that target. Large-scale, world-class copper projects are really tough to come by these days. So when the company saw low interest rates, but no real appealing projects to grow copper production, it saw value in adding oil and gas to the portfolio. One reason is that over the next five years, Freeport believes it can double its oil and gas production. The best part of this growth is its completely self-funded. That meant that Freeport could tap the debt markets for cheap debt to scoop up these assets, without needing additional external capital to grow the businesses once acquired. Freeport could simply reinvest the operating cash flow from oil and gas production to double production and then use the copious cash generation of its copper business to pay off the debt. As long as oil stays above $100 and gas is over $4.50, the oil and gas business should be throwing off excess cash by 2015. Further, depending on how copper does over that time, Freeport could be debt-free and even in a net cash position by 2016: Source: Freeport-McMoRan Investor Presentation Still, a lot has to go right for that to happen. For example, one of its assumptions is that gold prices stay above $1,500. That will be pretty tough, as gold prices dropped by another $100 just last week and now sit at less than $1,300 an ounce. This has crushed gold stocks over the past year, with shares of Yamana Gold ( ) , for example, down more than 40% over in the past year. Freeport is down 18% over the same time; however, this does show where its diversified commodity profile really shines, as it adds some cushion when commodities fall. One of the reasons the decline in gold price has hit Yamana so bad is that about 90% of its production is gold, as the only other commodity the company produces is just a tiny sliver of silver each year. Diversity is important for Freeport, because each $50-per-ounce movement in the price of gold affects its operating cash flow by $45 million, whereas a $0.10-per-pound movement in copper affects operating cash flow by $275 million. A similar move in gold would have a more distinct effect on Yamana's profits. Adding oil and gas takes away even more of the sting of commodity price volatility. That's because it will drop mining's effect on earnings to just 75% of its profits going forward. It's really tough to envision a future where oil prices drop much below $100 per barrel, as the cost of production alone would keep prices that high. Meanwhile, natural gas prices should at least be stable, if not provide upside, as we use more gas and begin to export our excess. Not only that, but Freeport's production is pretty well hedged into the future, with oil about 85% hedged this year and next, while about a third of its natural gas production is also hedged for the next year and a half. The bottom line for Freeport investors is that the worst-case scenario for the oil and gas business is it simply becomes a cash-flow business post-2015 if natural gas prices remain in neutral. The downside risk is pretty limited thanks to production hedges and the business' ability to be self-funding. What will be interesting to see is where Freeport goes next as it could continue to build its oil and gas business or take another page out of BHP Billiton's playbook and further diversify its revenue into areas such as coal or iron ore.

The property includes Bakken and Three Forks properties. Kodiak entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with privately held Liberty Resources to acquire approximately 42,000 net acres in McKenzie and southern Williams Counties, N.D., bringing Kodiak's pro forma total lease holdings in the Williston Basin to almost 196,000 net acres. It will also assume Denver-based Liberty's contract for one drilling rig, which has 14 months remaining on its term. Kodiak Chairman and CEO Lynn Peterson said: ""The increase to our inventory of future drilling locations provides the company with a longer runway of sustainable growth. As we continue our down-spacing work in our Koala and Smokey areas, we would expect the number of locations to increase significantly.  We also benefit from the addition of the production and its cash flow, as well as proved reserves included in the deal."" According to the company, the southern Williams County lands, approximating 14,000 net acres, are adjacent to Kodiak's core Polar area.  An additional 25,000 net acres are in McKenzie County, west of its Koala and Smokey areas. Net oil and gas production from the property in the pending acquisition is currently approximately 5,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, the average net production for May. ""Production is expected to increase before closing as completion operations are currently under way,"" said the company in its press release. Kodiak expects to fund the acquisition through borrowing under a revolving credit facility. Based on the additional capital expenditures for the acquisition net of cash flow from those assets, Kodiak anticipates investment and projected cash flow to be ""more or less equal for the remaining periods of 2013.""

1042,How These 3 Oil and Gas Companies Are Banking on Bakken Oil -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 09:38:00,"Oil production from the Bakken field in North Dakota and Montana is on the upswing, and EOG Resources, Kodiak Oil & Gas, and ConocoPhillips are reaping the benefits. are staking their claims in the Bakken field. Bakken production full steam ahead EOG Resources depends on the United States, which very much includes Bakken oil. Approximately, 94% of EOG's 2.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent reserves are located in the United States. Crude oil is a huge component of EOG's portfolio, and its crude oil production soared 40% last year. Going forward, management expects this superb growth to continue, as the company projects 27% crude oil production growth this year, because it's going to drill as many as 80 new wells in 2014. The vast majority of Kodiak's operations are focused on the Bakken field, more specifically in the Williston Basin in Western North Dakota and Eastern Montana. Most of its $775 million in 2013 capital expenditure plans were allocated to its Williston Basin oil and gas operations. This paid off, since Kodiak's oil and gas sales more than doubled last year to $904 million. Sales volumes clocked in at 10.6 million barrels of oil equivalents, and oil represented 95% of the company's revenue last year. One more oil major getting in on the Bakken action It's not just smaller players that are getting rich from Bakken Oil. ConocoPhillips, which is the biggest independent exploration and production in the United States, saw strong growth in its Lower 48 operating segment last year. This was due in no small part to Bakken oil. In all, Conoco increased oil and gas production by 7% in its Lower 48 portfolio last year. This looks fairly modest on the surface, but when you look deeper, its oil production was impressive. Conoco's oil production rose 24% last year, and production in the Bakken field itself soared 60%. More specifically, production hit 30,000 barrels per day in the Bakken in 2013. Going forward, Conoco plans to keep growth going. Management believes there's potential to take production up to 50,000 to 60,000 barrels per day over the next few years. In addition, the company continues to add reserve replacement in the Bakken, which will only strengthen its portfolio down the road. Banking on the Bakken Oil majors large and small are cashing in on all the Bakken field has to offer. Discovered decades ago, Bakken oil is only now hitting the scene since production was nearly impossible for so many years. Thanks to new drilling techniques, oil companies such as EOG Resources, Kodiak Oil & Gas, and ConocoPhillips are finally able to reach the ocean of gas sitting under the ground in North Dakota and Montana. Each company has devoted huge amounts of financial resources to acquiring acreage in the region and drilling new wells. It's already paying off in the form of soaring production and rising revenue, which is set to continue, thanks to the tantalizing production growth over the next several years.

1043,"Larimer County extends moratorium on oil and gas, 1041 permits",coloradoan,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 09:34:00,"Larimer County commissioners unanimously voted to extend the temporarymoratorium on permits for oil and gas and ""1041"" land use applications. View Comments Larimer County commissioners unanimously voted on Tuesday to extend the county's temporary moratorium on permits for oil and gas and ""1041"" land use applications. The temporary halt on new oil and gas applications was extended through September 15, and the moratorium on 1041 land use applications was extended through December 15. It was initially passed by the board last month and was set to expire Thursday. Commissioners John Kefalas, Kristin Stephens and Jody Shadduck-McNally approved the extension of the temporary moratoriums on permitting with a 3-0 vote. Their decision came after a more than three-hour public meeting Tuesday where dozens of community members spoke for and against the moratorium extensions. ""I've taken all of this input seriously and into full consideration, but I believe I also have the responsibility to thoughtfully protect the health, safety and welfare of our Larimer residents and future generations,"" Shadduck-McNally said. Shadduck-McNally said extending the moratorium would allow staff to focus on reviewing and amending the county's current regulations and give the public more time to provide input. County regulations: Stephens agreed that giving the community time to focus on this process without also dealing with incoming permit applications would provide more clarity on the process and allow staff to focus on ""finishing this important work."" ""It's important for us to get this right,"" Stephens said. Kefalas said it ""makes logical sense"" to extend the moratorium and give staff and the community space to focus on the ""complicated process."" County Director of Community Development Lesli Ellis told commissioners that county staff expects to have new draft regulations completed by fall 2021. The timeline for the oil and gas regulations review process includes multiple opportunities for public participation before then, Ellis said. 1041 permits are typically issued for projects that include multiple properties in the county and are of state interest, Ellis said. The county typically gets about two or three 1041 permit applications per year. The county's 1041 permitting process most recently caught public attention when commissioners in 2019 denied the city of Thornton's plan to build a water pipeline through the county, leading to a lawsuit. A Colorado judge has since upheld that decision, stating that Thornton failed in its application to meet three of 12 criteria for the project. Earlier: Court upholds Larimer County commissioners' denial of Thornton pipeline Supporters of the moratorium extension who spoke during Tuesday's meeting said the moratorium allows county staff to continue reviewing and amending the current oil and gas regulations with no unnecessary pressure of applications continuing to come in. ""I believe the moratoriums grant certainty to all the industries impacted by setting a clear timeline and allowing for regulations to be well-crafted without pressure to process permits while regulations are in flux,"" said Andrew Forkes-Gudmundsen, deputy director of LOGIC, the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans. Doug Henderson or Larimer Alliance told commissioners extending the moratoriums would provide clarity on the county's regulations and continue to protect the county's public health and environment during the review process. Opponents of the extension argued that the county has had plenty of time to review the regulations and it is possible to continue reviewing them while allowing the oil and gas industry to continue to operate. ""Moratorium through the extended process we heard from the planning director would take us through prime drilling season and would effectively result in a delay of a year or more in legitimate and responsible projects that meet all acknowledged environmental and safety standards after a yearlong catastrophic near-shutdown of the industry,"" Howard Boigon told commissioners on behalf of Wellington Operating Co. The county has worked for months on its rules for oil and gas permitting after the Democrat-controlled Colorado legislature gave municipal and county governments more control over future development during its 2019 session. County leaders adopted their first ever regulations on oil and gas facilities in April 2020, but citizen groups have asked for increased public health and safety measures. Earlier: Larimer County adopts first ever regulations on oil and gas facilities ""The boards decision today to unilaterally halt new permitting comes less than a year after the county rewrote its regulatory framework, which was developed carefully and in close coordination with stakeholders,"" Executive Director of American Petroleum Institute Lynn Granger said Tuesday in an email statement. Kefalas said the board's review of 1041 and oil and gas permitting regulations is part of a larger review of the county's land use codes they have to complete to comply with new state regulations passed late last year. We have a responsibility based on what was passed (by the state) in 2020 to look at what the statewide standards are and update our regulations to at least align with those standards,"" Kefalas said.

1044,How Will ExxonMobil Boost Its Oil and Gas Production? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 09:04:00,"Despite a wave of new projects slated to start up over the next few years, boosting oil and gas production remains a major challenge for ExxonMobil. Feb 1, 2014 at 10:04AM ExxonMobil's NYSE:XOM ) fourth-quarter financial results highlighted the oil giant's continued struggle with boosting oil and gas production, which fell 1.8% from the year-earlier quarter. Though the company has a number of major projects slated to start up over the next few years, will they be enough to deliver the 2%-3% annual production growth the company is targeting? Why Exxon's production fell Despite spending a record $42.5 billion on exploration and other capital projects last year, Exxon's fourth-quarter upstream earnings declined by 13%, or $976 million, to $6.8 billion, while companywide earnings fell 16% year over year to $8.4 billion, or $1.91 a share, down from $10 billion, or $2.20 a share, a year earlier. The company cited lower-than-expected output from its operations in Canada and Kazakhstan as two of the main factors behind the decline in its oil and gas production. Equipment issues prevented the company's Kearl oil sands project in Canada from reaching its full capacity of 110,000 barrels per day, while operations in Kazakhstan were delayed by a pipeline leak. These issues highlight how even a company like Exxon -- known for its superior capital allocation, peer-leading capital efficiency, and expert project management capabilities -- isn't immune from project delays. And given that the company plans to continue spending on riskier, technically complex projects around the world over the next five years, delays and other unexpected interruptions could continue weighing on production. Can Exxon boost production? Still, Exxon is confident that it can boost its oil and gas output and is targeting 2%-3% annual production growth over the next few years. In its fourth-quarter earnings conference call management touted the Kearl oil sands project, whose expansion is now more than 70% complete, and a liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, which will start up shortly, as key drivers of output growth. Operations in the U.S., where the company plans to add more rigs in Texas' Permian basin and continue developing fields in North Dakota and Oklahoma, as well as unconventional opportunities in Argentina, Russia, and Tanzania are also expected to contribute to production growth. But despite Exxon's optimism, there are a few reasons to be skeptical. Firstly, the company will lose a meaningful amount of production in the United Arab Emirates, estimated at approximately 150,000 barrels per day annually, after its joint venture contract to drill in Abu Dhabi's onshore oilfields ends this month.

1045,Can the Boom Continue for Kodiak Oil & Gas? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 08:03:00,"The Bakken player has seen huge growth, but is the end coming? Earnings Beats in Past 4 Quarters 2 Source: Yahoo! Finance. Will Kodiak Oil & Gas strike it rich this quarter? In recent months, analysts have largely held their ground on Kodiak's earnings prospects, holding their first-quarter estimates unchanged but boosting their full-year 2013 consensus by a penny per share. The stock, though, has reflected far less optimism among investors, falling more than 12% since late January. We've already gotten a strong idea of what Kodiak's first-quarter numbers will look like from its preliminary sales update. The company said that it more than doubled productionfrom last year's first quarter to 21,700 barrels per day. That leaves Kodiak well behind regional leader Continental Resources ( NYSE:CLR ) and its levels of roughly triple Kodiak's output, but with 18 net wells completed and expectations for 75 net wells for the year, Kodiak expects another 35%-45% of production growth by the end of the year. Kodiak's operational characteristics give investors a good idea of both its strengths and its weaknesses. It drills wells very quickly but without the same regard for cost that Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum ( NYSE:WLL ) have. If Kodiak could cut its costs by 20%to get into the same $8 million per well league as Continental and Whiting, it could cut $150 million of its capital expenditures for drilling activity in 2013 alone. One smart move that Kodiak has pursued is making improvements to its wastewater treatment infrastructure, especially by adding saltwater disposal injection wells of its own. Heckmann ( NASDAQOTH:NESC ) and other outside providers have had great success providing water services to drilling companies, but by moving more of those services in-house, Kodiak has the potential to produce substantial savings In Kodiak's report, pay close attention to any hints the company gives about potential merger and acquisition activity.

1047,United Airlines unveils plan to fund more sustainable jet fuel made from trash,oilandgas360,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 03:30:01,"The latest oil and gas news, dedicated to all things oil and gas: people, technologies, transactions, trends, and macro-economic analysis that impact commodity prices. United Airlines said on Tuesday it has partnered with global firms including Nike Inc and Siemens AG in an Eco-Skies Alliance to finance use this year of about 3.4 million gallons of low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuel derived from trash. Source: Reuters Though tiny compared with the 4.3 billion gallons of jet fuel that United consumed in 2019 prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount triples the roughly 1 million gallons of sustainable fuel it has used each year since 2016. Airlines have used sustainable fuel since 2008 as part of efforts to reduce outright emissions, but so far this represents barely 1% of the fuel used worldwide, industry groups say. Chicago-based United named 11 of more than a dozen global partners for the plan but did not disclose the cost, or how much each would contribute. Air transport accounts for 2%-3% of greenhouse gas emissions, the French aerospace association said on Tuesday. Environmental groups argue the sectors overall contribution is higher. Partners include companies with corporate or cargo deals with United, like Nike, Siemens, Palantir and Japans Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. United said the project gives customers a way to help reduce the environmental impact of flying beyond buying carbon offsets and could help create more of a market for sustainable aviation fuels. Well see how it develops, Chief Executive Scott Kirby told reporters. I think theres a huge appetite for it. The airline industry has focused more broadly on the purchase of carbon offsets to reduce the environmental impact of flying, pending the arrival of new technology to meet the sectors goal of halving net emissions by 2050 versus 2005. Environmental critics say offsets do not directly address climate goals and mask the problem of ongoing jet emissions. United, which along with some other carriers has said it wants to cut net emissions more aggressively by 100% by 2050, has criticized offsets and announced a recent investment in carbon-capture technology. It has invested in a sustainable aviation fuel producer called Fulcrum BioEnergy. While we know that aircraft are never going to be completely decarbonized, we are not going to use offsets as the way to get to 100% green, Kirby said. Airline association IATA says life cycle greenhouse emissions from sustainable fuel can be at least 80% lower than normal fuel and are the only medium-term option for curbing emissions growth, since airlines cannot yet switch to electric planes. Delta Air Lines has said it plans to replace 10% of its jet fuel, currently refined from fossil fuel, with sustainable aviation fuel by the end of 2030. While using waste avoids taking land from food production, environmental groups like Transport & Environment say such supplies are limited and face competition from other sectors.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/united-airlines-unveils-plan-to-fund-more-sustainable-jet-fuel-made-from-trash/

By Austin Fleskes| afleskes@prairiemountainmedia.com| April 13, 2021 at 8:38 p.m. As Larimer County continues to rework the countys land use code including oil and gas and 1041 permitting, county commissioners unanimously decided to extend the moratoriums for permits, in a ruling just two days before they would have expired, April 15. All three commissioners voted to extend the moratoriums, extending the oil and gas permit moratorium to Sept. 15, and extending the 1041 permit application moratorium to Dec. 15. The county commissioners placed the moratoriums on the two types of permits on March 16 and at the time Lesli Ellis, community development director, said the moratoriums would prevent potential applicants from rushing to apply before the new, and possibly stricter, rules are implemented. The county is currently in phase II of updating the Larimer County Land Use Code, with completion expected in September. During a land use hearing Tuesday afternoon, the commissioners heard from Ellis about the permits as well as from community members on their thoughts about whether the moratoriums should be extended. Many who called in to approve of the continuation of the moratoriums said the extra time will not only provide the commissioners more time to finish regulation changes, but will also have an impact on the environment as a whole. Andrew Forkes-Gudmundson, deputy director of the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans thanked commissioners for placing the moratoriums in the first place and said continuing them will provide more time to better change regulations. Nothing breeds uncertainty like applications being considered while the rules that govern that consideration are in flux, he said. Alida Villatoro said the dangers caused by oil and gas work should be  considered with the moratoriums and general oil and gas work in the county. Instead of trying to preserve outdated jobs, we need to move forward into the future with green technologies that will preserve our precious water and air, Villatoro said. Cory Carroll, a physician in Fort Collins, said that while many callers said they were concerned about jobs and businesses impacted by the moratoriums, he is more concerned about his patients and what the work of oil and gas can do to citizens. I look at cleaning up Colorado, cleaning up our air, turning our beautiful Front Range back to where it needs to be as a great economic decision, he said. For many people who called in to oppose the continuation of the moratoriums, the hold on permits was detrimental to jobs and businesses and is more of a political concern than a legitimate one. The professionals in this industry, many your constituents, are tired of being a political issue and just want to get to work so they can continue to focus on safety and the technological innovations that we have driven here in Colorado, said Rich Coolidge, director of regulatory affairs for the Colorado Oil and Gas Association. Janet Juell, a long-time resident of the county, said the oil and gas industry is an important part of Larimer Countys diverse and strong economy. Thousands of residents rely on oil and gas for employment, she said during the meeting. With this moratorium, how long can they sustain and stay in our community? These are people who will be forced to move and find other opportunities for employment. Lynn Granger, executive director of Colorados branch of the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to the Reporter-Herald after the meeting ended that the decision by commissioners is a troubling outlier in the intersection of politics and policy for the oil and gas industry. There is no substantive basis for a moratorium of any duration to be levied, and we are concerned that the boards decision today could yield significant economic hardship without providing any tangible benefits to public health, safety, welfare, the environment or wildlife, she wrote. The successful development and implementation of complex natural gas and oil regulations requires good faith, both from regulators and stakeholders, and a moratorium is a dramatic step away from that approach. Before commissioners voted on the matter, District II commissioner Kristin Stephens said it was important to note that while she was voting yes for an extension, she was not in favor of an indefinite moratorium. It is not about holding up the economy or business, Stephens said. It is really giving us this time to focus on these regulations that affect multiple properties. This is something that can affect whole neighborhoods and even bigger swathes of our county, so it is important for us to do this right. Jody Shadduck-McNally, commissioner for District III, said she was thankful for everyone who called and wrote in to weigh in on the matter and feels it is appropriate to extend the moratorium while regulations are updated. I believe I have the full responsibility to thoughtfully protect the health, safety and welfare of all the Larimer residents residing here in Larimer County as well as future generations, she said during the hearing.

1049,Higher Natural Gas Prices Could Pump up Oil Services Demand -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 10:15:00,"Domestic oil service firms Baker Hughes, Weatherford, and C&J Energy Service look primed for strong gains in 2014 with natural gas prices surging. , and C&J Energy Services ( ) to name a few that are intriguing. A major reason for recent weakness in the stocks has been less-than-robust capital expenditure plans by exploration firms to end the year. The general guidance for the fourth quarter wasn't overly robust, but the recent cold weather and reduction of natural gas inventories has pushed levels below prior years. The latest weekly report from EIA showed inventory levels 3% below the 5-year average levels. Also, the inventory number is already a substantial 7.2% below the levels of last year. It is still too early to tell if a new trend is forming, but investors need to remember that abundant supplies in the ground don't ensure abundant reasons to spend the capital in order to get the resource out of the ground. These three stocks should benefit once spending does pick up, and higher natural gas prices will ensure this eventually occurs. Domestic focus Of all the major oil service firms, Baker Hughes provides solid upside potential from a greater focus on domestic natural gas services. In the third quarter, Eastern Hemisphere revenue surged 20% compared to last year, mainly from growth in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. However, North American revenue only gained slightly over the last year, but for the first nine months revenue is actually down for the year. The company would be hitting on all cylinders if North American revenue, which accounts for nearly 50% of all revenue, were contributing decent growth. The percentage has dropped nearly 200 basis points in the last year. More importantly, North America accounts for nearly three times the revenue of the next largest region, Middle East and Asia Pacific. Turnaround major Weatherford trails considerably behind Baker Hughes with half the market valuation. Weatherford, though, has a business closer in size than the valuation would suggest. The company hopes to wrap up a tax issue that has hampered management's focus on operating efficiencies for more than a year. While Weatherford is much more focused on international operations with 60% of revenue from outside North America, the stock is nonetheless situated to benefit from a rebound in domestic demand. As with Baker Hughes, North America is by far the largest region at over 40% of total revenue. The impact of slower domestic business can be clearly seen in the $128 million year-over-year decline in North American revenue while the company as a whole had a slight gain. Again, the growth in the Eastern Hemisphere was strong all around. Domestic focused start-up C&J Energy Services has always had impressive margins, but the domestic hydraulic fracturing services company went public right at the peak of the market. Considering the company obtains 100% of its revenues from the U.S., the results have been in a continual decline over the last two years. In fact, earnings declined from $3.46 in 2012 to lowly expectations of only $1.34 this year. The one intriguing part about C&J Energy is that management has been aggressively expanding during the lean times of the last year. The company bought the wireline business of Casedhole in 2012 to provide geographic expansion into the Bakken and services expansion into the wireline business. Amazingly, the company is even adding a small amount of horsepower into the fracking business at the start of 2014. Other plans call for growing units in the other service lines of coiled tubing and wireline. At the recent energy conference, the CFO suggested that C&J Energy could add units into an oversupplied market due to the demand for its higher quality of work. Bottom line The fundamental backup for oil services demand in North America is picking up with natural gas inventories declining below 5-year averages and extremely cold weather in the U.S. The combination is beneficial to Baker Hughes, Weatherford, and C&J Energy Services that have been hurt by weak demand in the U.S. Combined with already strong international demand, 2014 could be a strong year for the domestic oil service stocks.

1050,What Oil Stock Investors Can Learn from the Energy Crises of the 1970s -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 13:07:00,"Demand for oil isn't totally price inelastic, and after the oil price shocks of the 1970s significant adjustments were made which had far reaching consequences for fuel economy and electricity generation. YCharts Incidentally, there is a perfectly logical reason why oil services companies, like Schlumberger and Halliburton, should be more affected by spot oil price movements than oil exploration and production (E & P) companies (ExxonMobile and Chevron). Specifically, earnings at services companies are more dictated by near-term oil prices, which affect demand for oil field services, while E & P companies are better valued with their long-term oil reserves in the ground in mind, along with their exploration potential. The evidence that oil demand isn't price inelastic The oil price shocks referenced above were dramatic by any measure. After adjusting for inflation, the Arab oil embargo crisis of 1973 saw oil prices jump from $20 to around $50 in no time -- an increase of 150% -- while the Iranian revolution led to an increase from around $55 to near $120 -- a near 120% increase. There are two arguments to suggest that the impact of these events had significant effects on demand. First, let's look at US motor vehicle fuel efficiency, a very important determinant of global oil demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates world oil demand in 2016 was 96.6 million barrels per day (mbpd), with the U.S. responsible for around 21%, and U.S. motor gasoline demand (9.3 mbpd) responsible for 9.6% of total world demand. The chart below shows how the crises spurred increases in fuel efficiency, with an inflexion in 1973 and a huge jump in 1979 -- evidence that higher oil prices will change thinking about fuel economy and reduce oil demand. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration. Logarithmic scale. Electricity The second chart shows energy inputs into electricity plants in the U.S. As you can see below, in 1971 oil products were the third largest contributor, but following the oil crises of the 1970s actions were taken to wean electricity production away from oil and toward coal, nuclear, and natural gas. Again, it's a demonstration of the fact that oil demand can readjust to higher prices -- oil products are pretty much irrelevant to U.S. electricity production now. Data source: International Energy Agency Headline Data. ktoe is kilotonne of oil equivalent What this means for oil stock investors The evidence from the actions taken following the energy crises suggests that oil demand isn't as price inelastic as many oil bulls may assume it to be -- a key concern if you are pricing in significant oil price increases in future. Moreover, given the importance of U.S. gasoline demand, and the fact that 70% of petroleum in the U.S. has been used for transportation in recent years, what happens to global oil demand if the U.S. embarks on a wide-scale shift to energy-efficient electric vehicles? Even if you are bullish on oil in the long-term -- and there is a case for emerging markets to propel demand -- it might make sense to balance risk by investing in stocks that benefit from trends like electrification of vehicles and the use of natural gas. has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Oil rose 2.1 percent last week. ) Oct 15, 2012 at 1:04PM NEW YORK (AP) -- The price of oil is falling Monday and giving back about half of last week's gains. In midday trading, benchmark crude oil was down 99 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $90.87. Oil rose 2.1 percent last week. Traders are brushing off some positive U.S. economic news. The Commerce Department says retail sales rose 1.1 percent last month. That follows a 1.2 percent increase in August. They were the largest gains in two years, driven by auto sales and the release of the iPhone 5. The focus instead is on weaker oil demand. On Friday, the International Energy Agency issued a new report predicting slower growth in demand for oil over the next five years. The agency also forecast that supplies will increase as the global economy struggles to grow. Oil finished down 21 cents on Friday. Prices at the pump fell more than 2 cents over the weekend to $3.787 per gallon. A month ago, gas averaged $3.867. Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service, said some markets around the U.S. are seeing the lowest wholesale or spot prices for gasoline since mid-July. If that trend holds, Kloza said, it could spell relief from stubbornly high gas prices for some Rust Belt cities as well as a few places in the South. Wholesale gasoline futures traded in New York gave up 2 cents to $2.87 a gallon. Brent crude, used to price international varieties of oil, fell 8 cents to $113.52. Other futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange: Natural gas fell 10 cents to $3.51 per 1,000 cubic feet. Heating oil fell 3 cents to $3.19 a gallon.

1052,Profit From $60 Oil -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 23:00:00,"Gas prices are near record highs, but Big Oil doesn't have to be the only group making money. 19% Dollar figures in millions. Data provided by Capital IQ. These riches are the result of increasing global demand for oil and disruptions caused by hurricanes and war. And prices aren't coming down. Demand in the United States, and in growing economies such as China and India, is going nowhere but up. Exxon estimates that the world's energy needs will be 50% greater in 2030. The partisan standstill in Washington simply doesn't stand a chance of reducing prices. So we're stuck, right? Wrong. Big Oil needs you Sustained high oil prices make it extremely rewarding for oil companies to get the most out of their wells and reserves. Moreover, high prices make it economically feasible for oil companies to invest in new technologies that can better map reserves and find new places for exploration. These technologies include onshore and offshore seismic data acquisition services, reservoir monitoring, and thermal imaging. Big players in this industry include Halliburton and Schlumberger. But they don't always have the best technology. That's where you come in. Small wonders As Clay Christensen noted in The Innovator's Dilemma, small companies are much better than large companies at developing new process technologies. That's because it's easier for them to justify investment in small markets early on -- when investment is most critical. Investors in these small companies -- if or when the innovation bears fruit -- are then treated to incredible gains, since the giants need to either hire or acquire the small firm in order to remain on top. For an example, just remember how well early investors in PayPal did when eBay snapped up the company and its transaction technology back in 2002. The same phenomenon is occurring in the oil industry today. Several tiny companies are signing big contracts to help Big Oil increase production from existing wells and identify promising new reserves. After all, one of the most costly blunders an oil company can make is to drill a dry well.

1053,"Oil Falls 2%, Gas Prices to Keep Dropping -- The Motley Fool",fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 14:53:00,"Weak U.S. economic reports Friday followed on the heels of reduced forecasts for oil demand. Oil dropped 2 percent. ) Apr 12, 2013 at 3:53PM NEW YORK (AP) -- Signs that the global economy isn't strong enough to quickly burn through the world's ample supplies of oil and gasoline sank crude oil prices for a second straight day. Weak U.S. economic reports Friday followed on the heels of reduced forecasts for oil demand. Oil dropped 2 percent. The falling prices will help extend a long, slow slide in retail gasoline prices, forecasters say. The average price of a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. fell a penny overnight to $3.56 per gallon. That's 23 cents lower than the high for the year, set on Feb. 27. And gas is now 36 cents cheaper than a year ago at this time. Drivers in some states, such as Wyoming, Montana, Missouri, and South Carolina, may even see a few stations selling gas for under $3.00 per gallon this weekend, says Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at Gasbuddy.com. ""We're looking at (futures and wholesale) prices that will propel this drop into the spring,"" Kloza said. Gasoline prices appear to be on a similar curve to last year, but on an earlier timetable. The springtime highs instead came in late winter, and a seasonal low could come in June this year instead of July. ""It's the same roller-coaster ride, but the top of the ride came sooner,"" Kloza said. U.S. oil futures fell $2.22, or 2.4 percent, to $91.29 in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil used by many U.S. refiners to make gasoline, fell $1.34 to $103.04, the lowest level since mid-July. Supplies of both oil and gasoline are plentiful, and demand appears to be weak. ""It's the usual culprits,"" says Judith Dwarkin, Chief Economist at ITG Investment Research. ""Supply growth is outpacing demand growth."" In each of the last two years the global oil market faced falling supplies because of production disruptions in the North Sea, East Africa, and Iran, which was facing tighter sanctions. This year, production has proceeded mostly as expected. U.S. output is booming, but Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations have cut back somewhat in response. In the U.S., refining capacity is at an all-time high and refiners have gotten a head start on making gasoline for the summer driving season. With supplies above normal for this time of year, refineries might pull back on oil purchases in the coming months. That will slow the drawing down of oil supplies, and keep prices lower. At the same time, the global economy still shows signs of weakness, suggesting that oil consumption will grow less than expected. When economic growth slows, drivers, shippers and travelers use less gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The U.S. Commerce Department said Friday that sales at U.S. retailers fell 0.4 percent last month, indicating that higher taxes and weak hiring likely made some consumers more cautious about spending. The Commerce Department also reported that companies restocked their shelves at a much slower pace in February than in the month before, a sign that companies expect consumers and businesses to pull back on spending. OPEC, the U.S. Energy Department and the International Energy Agency, which represents a group of oil-consuming nations, all lowered their outlook for global oil demand this week. The IEA on Thursday dropped its forecast for demand this year by 45,000 barrels to 90.6 million barrels a day. In other energy futures trading on the Nymex: Gasoline fell 3 cents to $2.80 per gallon. Natural gas rose 8 cents to $4.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. Heating oil fell 3 cents to $2.87 per gallon.

The storage reserve will hold approximately 1 million barrels of gasoline, and DOE estimates it will cost $215 million to build. The decision to build gasoline storage infrastructure is part of the government's response to the widespread damage caused by 2012's Hurricane Sandy. In the super storm's aftermath, people in New Jersey and New York suffered through periods of blackouts and gasoline shortages. Some gas stations had no supplies for 30 days and others experienced long lines. The new reserve, to be built in the New York Harbor area, will be tapped if another disaster disrupts regular supplies. The Obama administration said they see it as the first of several oil reserves that will be constructed around the country in order to plan for future extreme weather events, believed to caused by climate change. ""In addition to our mitigation and international efforts, the president's Climate Action Plan calls on us to take measures today in order to better prepare for the effects of climate change we already see occurring here at home,"" Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz said in a statement. DOE's action was prompted in part by pressure from New York's U.S. senator, Chuck Schumer (D), who urged DOE to find ways to avoid another scenario in which an extreme weather event causes fuel outages. The U.S. has managed a national strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) since the late 1970s, after the 1973 oil embargo by Arab countries. The SPR holds around 700 million barrels of oil in salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana. Fuel from the SPR has been deployed only three times by presidents in the past  during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and during the Arab Spring in 2011.

Are Foreign Oil Companies Taking Over North America? A record amount of foreign investment has come into American energy. Tyler Crowe and Aimee Duffy ( ) Apr 13, 2013 at 9:30AM For the past couple years, more and more foreign energy companies are investing in the U.S. In  2012, $138 billion was invested in unconventional shale plays in the U.S., $26 billion of which came from foreign companies. A majority of this investment has come in the forms of joint ventures with U.S. exploration and production companies. On the surface, these deals don't seem to be worth the investment for these foreign companies. But by being a part of shale drilling operations gives them something that they don't have: expertise. Thanks to the favorable regulatory framework in the U.S., many companies are given a little more freedom to experiment with drilling techniques. This has been a critical factor in U.S. companies pulling ahead as the premiere shale gas extractors. With so much practice here, these foreign companies want to learn how to do it right, so they too can tap their own shale reserves.

The putative class-action lawsuit that Certified Roses Inc, a producer and wholesaler of garden roses, filed on Thursday alleges that Houston-based Symmetry breached its contracts with its customers nationwide when it jacked up the price of gas during the coast-to-coast storm, including by charging Certified Roses some 2,000% more in February than for the same month the previous year.

1059,Why Sempra Energy's Gas Exports Won't Help Ukraine -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16 09:21:00,"The decision to approve the Cameron LNG project is good news for Sempra Energy and construction contractor Chicago Bridge & Iron, but the natural gas won't reach the Ukraine market anytime soon, if at all. ) Jun 24, 2014 at 10:21AM The recent announcement that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the Cameron LNG export project is big news for Sempra Energy ( NYSE:SRE ) , but investors shouldn't get too excited just yet. The project is the second such LNG export facility to get approved, and the media suggeststhat the approval process was recently expedited to ship natural gas to Europe, and specifically Ukraine. The gas may never reach that country, though. In addition, the energy department recently changed the approval processto expedite decision-making procedures on LNG exports. The Cameron LNG project is 50.2% owned by Sempra Energy with the remaining positions split between French and Japanese energy companies. The project involves the development of a three-train liquefaction facility in Hackberry, LA, that will provide export capability of 12 million tons per annum of LNG, or approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd). The project is similar to the Sabine Pass LNG export project by Cheniere Energy ( NYSEMKT:LNG ) , which is significantly farther along in the construction process and has helped push that company's stock to new highs. Project timeline While the project may have gotten approval recently due to the issues with Russia supplying gas to the rest of Europe and especially Ukraine, the project timeline makes it impossible to solve the current crisis. The FERC approval allows Cameron LNG to go forward with construction of the $9 billion to $10 billion project that will take up to five years to reach full production. Chicago Bridge & Iron Company ( NYSE:CBI ) is leading the nearly $6 billion construction project via a joint venture with Chiyoda International. The joint venture has experience with the construction of 43 LNG trains worldwide that amount to over 40% of world LNG liquefaction capacity. For those hoping for a quick resolution to the Ukraine gas supply issue, the Cameron project or any LNG export project isn't the short-term solution. The estimate is that the project won't even start initial production until early 2018, with full-scale production by 2019. The good news for Sempra is that the existing facility originally designed for LNG imports has plenty of land available to expand the project. Source: Sempra Energy Locked-in customers The economics of the contracts also make it unlikely that a large portion of the gas ends up in Ukraine. The contracts signed by Sempra require its 16.6% partners in the Cameron LNG project (Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and GDF SUEZ) to sign binding 20-year tolling agreements for the gas. Mitsubishi and Mitsui customers already include Tepco and Toho Gas in Asia. It's possible that the GDF SUEZ supply will end up in Europe and possibly Ukraine. In a similar manner, Cheniere Energy contracted the majority of its LNG export capability in long-term take-or-pay deals to mostly Asian buyers, including GAIL in India and Korean Gas. Bottom line The energy market is very fluid. Opening up the domestic natural gas production to export markets will provide at least an indirect benefit to Ukraine and Europe, even if the gas heads directly to Asian markets willing to sign 20-year contracts. In addition, more supply on the market helps to reduce the leverage that Russia has on the political landscape in Europe, as the governments there are currently reliant on energy supplies from that country. Ultimately, Sempra Energy benefits from a forecasted share of income it estimates at $400 million annually. Chicago Bridge & Iron, meanwhile, can move forward with work on the large-scale project.

1062,The Best Energy Stocks of 2012: Cheniere Energy -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 15:00:00,"Gas prices, political wrangling, and big funding ... oh, my.  Cheniere had a serendipitous run this year. Can the company keep it up? , which is up 107%. How it's done in comparison with its peers It's difficult to compare Cheniere with its peers, because the company really has no peers. Cheniere is the only company to receive an unrestricted license to export liquefied natural gas from the United States. There are three other licensed LNG export facilities in the U.S., but they're allowed to export only to countries with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement The year that was Cheniere 2012: Things fall together Remember when Cheniere built all of those facilities to import natural gas? Well, so much for that idea. With American companies producing gas hand over fist, we have more of the stuff than we know what to do with. Luckily for Cheniere, the facilities that it built for imports can be converted to export as well, and Cheniere is betting the farm on that very idea. Thanks to widening spot prices for natural gas around the globe, it's now commercially possible to liquefy, ship, and regasify natural gas. Japan Liquefied Natural Gas Import Price data by YCharts While these price differentials are rather extreme, keep in mind that there are heavy costs associated with turning the gas to liquid and back to gas. The opportunity to profit is there, but don't expect a $14 profit per million BTUs of gas going from the U.S. to Japan. To make these projects happen, the company will need a lot of capital, and that's where Blackstone Group ( NYSE:BX ) comes into play. Back in August, Cheniere raised $2 billion in funding from issuing shares in its LP Cheniere Energy Partners ( ) to the Blackstone Group. Also, thanks to a political kerfuffle, U.S. department of energy says it will not issue any other LNG licenses until it has reviewed a complaint regarding the Cheniere license. So, barring any major changes in the recent future, Cheniere will have the sole rights to export beyond U.S. free trade agreements. With all of these elements falling into place for the company, the orders from overseas have been pouring in. Cheniere has contracts at capacity for the facility three years before the first liquefaction treatment train goes online. Since November of last year, Cheniere has signed five 20-year deals with the U.K.'s BG Group, Spain's GasNatural Fenosa, India's GAIL, South Korea's KOGAS, and, most recently, French giant Total ( ) , respectively. These contracts equate to approximately 2.2 bcf per day leaving Cheniere's Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana. And to throw a cherry on top of a good year year, there is a chance that Cheniere will start paying a dividend Is this sustainable? If this political stalemate stands for some time, then Cheniere essentially has a government-mandated monopoly on LNG in the United States. With a viable outlet for the glut of U.S. supply, several shale gas plays will ramp up production to meet a global demand for what was previously considered a regional product. Keep in mind, though, that Cheniere doesn't expect its Sabine Pass facility to come online before 2015. By then, it is possible that another one of the six LNG ports in the U.S. could receive an unrestricted license. While this may not hurt operations at Sabine Pass, it could have implications for the development of its second facility in Corpus Christi, Texas. Another wild card in this story is Canada. Back in October of last year, Canada's National Energy Board granted the Kitimat LNG terminal in British Columbia a 20-year export license.

1064,Energy Transfer Partners (ETP): Will Oil Price Collapse Sink the Payout? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 15, 2021",2021-04-15 11:10:00,"With oil prices declining almost 40% off recent highs, many energy investors are worried about the safety of their dividends. Find out if you should be, too. $136 Sources: Reuters, Bloomberg, Marketwatch. A large proportion of today's oil production is currently occurring in nations who depend on far higher prices to balance their budgets. Similarly, while the average production cost in North Dakota's Bakken shale is just $38 per barrel, nationwide U.S. shale production costs are higher, with an average cost of $70 to $77 per barrel, according to Reuters. This means that at current oil prices, production growth in the US may soon grind to a halt. For example, according to analyst firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. at $70 per barrel, U.S. oil production growth will halt , and below it, production will begin to shrink. Simply put, budgetary necessities faced by many petro-states as well as the economic reality that one third of U.S. shale production is uneconomical below $80 per barrel, mean things will likely have to change sooner rather than later. Over the coming months, it's probable that someone, OPEC, Russia, or U.S. producers, will be forced to cut production, which could cause oil prices to stabilize and rise to more favorable levels. Bottom line: Distribution is likely safe While the recent collapse of oil prices and subsequent decline in energy stocks may be frightening, the fact is, most midstream distributions are likely safe. In the short term, long-term fixed fee contracts will probably insulate cash flow sufficiently for MLPs like Energy Transfer Partners, with its strong coverage ratio, to continue paying and growing its payout long enough for oil prices to recover. However, current and potential investors in Energy Transfer Partners should be aware of its heavy debt burden and potentially higher cost of capital that could affect the MLP's future distribution growth.

1065,Noble Prize for Oil Drilling -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 23:00:00,"More operating days, better utilization, and higher rates per day spell profit for Noble Energy. ) Jul 19, 2005 at 12:00AM It looks like a perfect storm for offshore energy drillers these days, though management at Noble (NYSE:NE) would probably prefer that I not tempt fate by mentioning any sort of storm. Second-quarter results for Noble were, well, noble. Revenue rose 36%, operating margins improved notably, operating income grew 97%, and net income more than doubled. Dayrates (an industry term for rates per day) are the hot topic du jour in drilling, and Noble saw considerably higher dayrates for the period. While average international dayrates climbed nearly 10%, domestic dayrates jumped about 25% from the year-ago quarter. That's nice, but it's not the whole story. Noble saw much higher utilization (97% vs. 84%) rates as more rigs were in action. Even more important, though, the number of operating days increased by 20%. Dayrates are all well and good, but if your rigs aren't operating, you don't get those dayrates, so that increase in operating days is definitely a positive that shouldn't be ignored or overlooked. Looking around the oil patch, there's really not much reason to believe that dayrates or demand are about to fall off soon. Customers such as Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) continue to sign lucrative multiyear deals, and competitors such as Transocean (NYSE:RIG) (NYSE:GSF) are reporting ongoing dayrate and utilization increases, as well. Of course, it's not all perfect. The labor market is tight, shipyard costs are increasing, and Noble management does expect operating costs to increase. That said, it doesn't seem like costs are going to get out of control or get too far out of balance vis-a-vis revenue growth. Management also offered a fairly frank discussion of its plans for the use of cash. While acknowledging the need to continue to spend on capital projects, management is looking at further share buybacks and/or enhanced dividend payments as a means of sharing that cash with owners. Interestingly, management is apparently considering a variable dividend that would be tied to certain financial metrics. I applaud them for considering the idea, though it's tough to predict how the market might accept a variable dividend. I could probably go on for a few hundred more words on the virtues of Noble and drilling in general. I like this company and I like this management team.

1068,Energy Stocks Jump Despite Oil's Plunge -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 14:37:00,"Oil is down again today, but that hasn't hurt big oil or Transocean, the S&P's new entrant. ) are up 0.7% and 1%, respectively. While oil has fallen from around $103 per barrel last Wednesday to less than $98 per barrel today, Chevron and ExxonMobil are both up just less than 1%. The reason oil isn't pulling them down is that falling oil prices aren't all bad for business. While exploration profits may suffer from lower oil prices, profits will go up on the refining side of the business. Refineries make a profit on the difference between the price of gasoline and the price of oil, and that has actually widened in the past week. While oil is down about 5% over the past week, gasoline has only dropped about $0.02 to $3.35 per gallon, according to GasBuddy. That's a drop of about 0.6%, which differs from the drop in oil prices and leaves more profit for Chevron and ExxonMobil's refineries. It's like taking profit out of one pocket and putting it in another. Another energy member in the S&P 500 The other energy stock making noise today is Transocean ( NYSE:RIG ) , the offshore drilling-rig owner, which will be added to the S&P 500 on Oct. 28. The stock is up 5.5% on the news, primarily because S&P 500 index funds will soon be forced to buy the stock. A pop like this doesn't often last long, because buyers today are buying for more technical reasons than fundamental ones. With that said, Transocean is well-positioned in an expanding ultra-deepwater drilling market, so it will profit from some of the long-term price pressures facing companies like Chevron and ExxonMobil in the oil industry.

1069,5 Companies Primed to Profit From This $3.3 Trillion Energy Prize -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 14:18:00,"Oil prices might be half what they were, but these shale drillers hold prime positions in Americas super basin, ) Sep 30, 2017 at 3:18PM The Permian Basinthat sits underneath western Texas and southeast New Mexico has produced a remarkable 29 billion barrels of oil since its discovery nearly a century ago. However, according to a recent report by IHS Markit, drillers have only just scratched the surface since there could be as much as 60 billion to 70 billion barrels of recoverable oil still saturating those rocks. It's a massive prize IHS Markit pegs as being worth a stunning $3.3 trillion at current oil prices. While hundreds of oil companies are vying for positions to tap into this bounty, a handful built up top-tier acreage holdings in some of the Permian's best spots. As a result, these companies are forecasting prodigious growth in production and cash flow, which could fuel big-time returns for investors if oil doesn't budge and with even greater potential if prices rise. Image source: Getty Images. The leader in the east Pioneer Natural Resources NYSE:PXD ) controls the largest acreage position in the Midland Basin side of the Permian. The company currently estimates that it can drill more than 20,000 future wells across its land holdings, which could unlock as much as 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources. What's most important to note about that drillable inventory is that the company can earn exceptionally high returns at current oil prices, with its 2017 average expected to be between 40% to 75%. Because of those returns, Pioneer believes that it can increase its oil output by 15% annually over the next several years, with cash flow growing at a 20% compound annual rate. In fact, it believes it can boost production up from the 259,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) it averaged last quarter up to 1 million BOE/d by 2026. That growth could enable Pioneer to produce tech stock-like returns in the decade ahead. A pure play on all sides While Pioneer's focus is in the Midland Basin to the east, Concho Resources ( NYSE:CXO ) is taking a basinwide approach since it controls acreage in the Midland as well as both the Northern and Southern Delaware Basin and the New Mexico Shelf. That diversification across the Basin gives the company more room to expand. With more than 19,000 drilling locations that hold an estimated 8 billion BOE of resources, it has ample resource potential already under control. Consequently, Concho Resources is on pace to increase its production by a 20% compound annual rate through 2019, which it can achieve within cash flow at around current oil prices.

1071,3 Energy Stocks Set to Soar When American Oil Recovers -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 10:00:00,"Learn about 3 undervalued oil stocks that are likely to boom when America's shale oil industry finally turns the corner. YCharts With oil prices rising so ferociously over the past two months, many investors are wondering whether the oil crash is finally over. While no one can accurately predict whether this rally will prove to have legs or not, at some point America's shale oil industry will recover. We asked three of our energy contributors which oil stocks were most likely to prove winning long-term investments when it does. : I have no idea when oil will truly turn around, but when it does I know that I want to own as much of the frac sand MLP Emerge Energy Services ( ) as I can, for two main reasons. First, the long-term growth thesis for the MLP is incredibly strong. Frac sand is one of the best, and cheapest, ways for oil producers to increase the production, and thus the profitability, of their wells. Source: Hi-Crush Energy Partners investor presentation. In fact, as this image from fellow frac sand producer Hi-Crush Partners shows, even during the oil crash frac sand usage per well has been on the upswing. The latest drilling techniques require much more sand than older methods -- up to 15,000 tonsper well -- and the energy analyst firm IHS estimates there are 2,500 to 3,500 incomplete wells in the US, while Bloomberg estimates that 50,000 old wells are eligible for an ultra low cost way of increasing production called refracking. With a possible 53,500 wells needing several kilotons of sand each, you can see why I'm so bullish on the long-term prospects of this industry once oil prices rebound. The second reason I like Emerge, especially at today's prices, is because the stock recently took a brutal 30% clobbering when management announced it was cutting its distribution by 29% for the coming quarter, and issued 2015 distribution guidance that was 47% lowerthan last year's payout. Emerge is a variable distribution MLP, so it pays out 100% of its distributable cash flow each quarter. Thus its payout will be volatile, something many investors may not realize if they don't research how it manages its distributions. With the oil crash causing U.S. rig counts to plunge, I was expecting a large distribution cut, and hoping for a major market over-reaction, which has now occurred. With a yield of 8.2% for the current year's payout guidance, I'm perfectly happy to patiently wait and collect my fat distributions. However, I think this new guidance may prove too conservative, so I see some potential upside -- both in terms of a higher payout and a possible bump in the unit price for any pleasant distribution surprises that might arise when crude eventually recovers. Tyler Crowe : One group of companies that has particularly taken it on the chin has been those that own and lease land rigs. After all, what would you expect when total rig count has declined by 52%? That means there are a lot of rigs out of work. But one company that hasn't been as deeply affected has been Helmerich & Payne ( NYSE:HP ) . Management expects that the upcoming quarters will continue to be a little rough as average day rates across the U.S. continue to fall and the company's U.S. land rig utilization rate declines to 49%. However, even with less than stellar numbers the company is still generating strong returns, and has maintained a stellar balance sheet with more cash on the books than long term debt.

1072,Oil Prices: Is Another Tumble in the Forecast? -- The Motley Fool,fool,"Apr 14, 2021",2021-04-14 08:09:00,"The International Energy Agencys latest forecast isnt exactly what oil bulls want to see. NYSE:BTE ) could be among those most deeply impacted because all three still have a mountain of debt to address. In Denbury's case, the company noted that it had borrowed $495 million of the $1.05 billion available to it under its current credit facility, which is a $194 million increase since the start of the year. Denbury needs oil well above the current price to pay that back with excess cash flow; the company recently indicated that a low-to-mid $50 oil price would give it enough extra money over the last few months of the year to pay borrowings down to a range of $450 million to $475 million. Canadian driller Baytex Energy is also in a tight spot. Last quarter, for example, the company noted that it reduced net debt by 70.6 million Canadian dollars ($55.4 million) through a combination of excess cash flow, a non-core asset sale, and the stronger Canadian dollar. However, that barely put a dent in its outstanding borrowings since Baytex still has 1.75 billion Canadian dollars ($1.4 billion) in debt outstanding. Meanwhile, California Resources is one of the most indebted oil companies in the industry. Despite paying off more than $1.6 billion in debt since mid-2015, it has an unsightly leverage ratio of more than 112% of its total capitalization, when most oil companies like to keep that number below 30%. Those tight financial situations are a reminder that investors should steer clear of oil stocks that can barely hang on should oil fall back toward $50 a barrel. Instead, they should consider investing in those that can excel in that environment One that stands out is ConocoPhillips ( NYSE:COP ) . The U.S. oil giant has repositioned its operations so it can maintain its current production rate and pay its dividend even if oil falls into the mid-$40s. Meanwhile, at $50 oil, ConocoPhillips can generate enough cash flow to send more money backto investors while also delivering meaningful production growth. Because of that, its stock should hold up -- if not increase in value -- even if crude dips. Stick with the best While the oil market is on the mend, it's not in the clear just yet. That's because the balance between supply and demand remains fragile, which could cause oil prices to teeter back and forth. This delicate state is why energy investors are better off sticking with top-tier oil stocks instead of gambling on the potential rebound of a weaker oil company. owns shares of ConocoPhillips and Denbury Resources.

Read More Hide Full Article Operators in the Permian Basin  the lowest-cost shale region are gradually looking to boost output. Experts say that its cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin, as compared to most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. Permians attractive economics. This means that producers can make money and sustain growth there at the current price. According to estimates, the average breakeven prices in most of the Permian well locations is below $50 per barrel  the lowest in the United States. However, the bulk of the exploration and production companies in the other regions are showing little sign of straying from their restrained drilling programs. Abundant Supply Puts Downward Pressure on Oil Prices The shale revolution greatly improved U.S. energy independence. But it also ushered in a flood of domestic supply that led to lower prices. The breakneck in production growth continued to put pressure on prices to an extent wherein the majority of oil plays worked on razor-thin margins. There was always a concern that the frenzied activity out of the shale region was economically unsustainable in the long term given the massive capital burn, depressed returns and huge debts. Spread of Coronavirus Triggers Further Panic Then came the coronavirus pandemic, the subsequent hit to global oil demand and with it, the collapse of prices. With WTI crude futures falling below $30, $20, $10 and even going below zero for a while, U.S. shale oil producers started feeling the heat. A wave of bankruptcies followed as prices werent enough for them to survive the long term. Even the Permian, where production had been on a tear until recently, was forced to go into negative growth amid unsustainable oil realizations. Oil between $45 and $50 a barrel is considered the break-even point for most shale operators, which means that they need crude prices of at least $45 to balance their operating cash flows with capital expenditure. Consequently, for the major part of 2020, oil prices were too low for the beleaguered firms  especially the highly leveraged ones  to continue producing.
