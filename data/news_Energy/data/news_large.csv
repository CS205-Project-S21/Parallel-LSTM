According to Reuters, citing the law Firm Hayes & Boon, bankruptcydata.com and its own data, 59 oil and gas companies have now filed for bankruptcy. (See also: 5 Energy Companies Crushed by Low Oil in 2016 .) The previous wave of bankruptcies to afflict a particular industry, the 2002-2003 telecom bust, saw 68. Charles Gibbs, restructuring partner at Akin Gump, told Reuters that the oil and gas industry may not be even halfway through the rout. After spiking above $100 as recently as the summer of 2014, oil prices began a sustained decline, falling to around $27 this past February. Shale drillers, riding a wave of excitement at the successful deployment of a relatively new technology, hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking,"" took on massive debt loads when times were good, and perhaps ironically, they contributed to the supply glut that has driven prices down. In a reversal of the once-prevailing wisdom, lower oil prices began to drag on market sentiment, and equity indices fell in line with a barrel of crude. That correlation has called into question the previous assumption, that low prices would put money in consumers' pockets, helping companies' sales and driving stock prices up. Instead, low prices have led to worries that indebted companies would default, perhaps hurting the banks who lent to them. Bank stocks led the market decline in the early part of the year, but so far the more dire scenarios involving their oil-patch lending have not come to pass.

For decades, energy companies have relied on rich pools of data to discover and understand the potential in their reservoirs and other production opportunities.","We are a global business consulting firm. Share to facebook Share to linkedin By Riccardo Bertocco, Lodewijk de Graauw and Dmitry Naberezhnev Unlike other industries that are enjoying a sudden embrace of benefits from data, the oil and gas sector is well acquainted with analytics. For decades, energy companies have relied on rich pools of data to discover and understand the potential in their reservoirs and other production opportunities. Even so, most have yet to capture the full potential of their data because they havent always been able to generate actionable insights or make better and faster decisions based on data. That will change as oil and gas companies upgrade their digital capabilitiesand improve the way they connect these insights to their operating models. We expect to see dramatic cost savings and signicant improvements in productivity and revenue. One integrated oil company managed to save about 10% on unit costs by digitizing a remote offshore operations center. Another reduced operating costs per barrel by about 10% and recovered more reserves by applying selective applications in intelligent oilelds through collective computing and sharing real-time information at all company levels. Most of todays digital initiatives in oil and gas are incremental rather than disruptive. Companies are making improvements in technical or operational capabilities, like predictive maintenance or completed analysis on wells. One reason for this gradual approach is that most companies arent ready for a big transformation because they lack the people, processes and capital required to make it happen. In particular, we see three common pitfalls in some oil and gas companies that have begun to invest in digital.  No long-term digital strategy. Without an integrated, multiyear plan, companies risk investing billions of dollars while capturing few benets. For example, offshore platforms can generate more than a terabyte of data every day, but the satellite uplink is too slow to transfer all that data  so the operations teams on land cant keep up with the available data. An integrated plan would spot this and place the analytics resources closer to the data: on the platform.  Outdated operating model. Valuable information can get stranded if companies neglect to connect information flows. For example, a company might invest in a visual scheduling system with sophisticated routing capabilities. But if it fails to connect it to line managements scheduling systems, the data winds up stranded.  Unprepared workforce. As in many other industries, oil and gas teams are mostly unprepared to take full advantage of the potential in digital. Most will need to invest in the capabilities of their teams  in most cases requiring a combination of recruiting fresh talent (including data scientists and other digitally savvy professionals) and teaching new skills to current staff. As companies put in place specic digital capabilities that can deliver fast results at reasonable costs, executives need to develop a strategic roadmap encompassing the digital strategy, operating model changes and, most important, people capabilities. Related: How Offshore Drilling Can Transform to Thrive in the Long Term Approaches differ, of course, from one company to the next, depending on appetite for risk and the potential gains at hand. But they typically include ve key elements:  Identify the areas of the value chain with the highest impact on nancial and operating results and cross them with the opportunities to enhance delivery through digital technologies.  Monitor key industry and technology trends, focusing on the identied value chain areas that are specic to the operations. Decide whether to lead the industry by innovating or by acting as a fast follower by implementing tested technologies and processes.  Clearly dene the links between the companys most critical decisions and digital applications, including showing how digital applications will improve decision-making effectiveness. In addition, adjust the operating model to facilitate the sharing of key information, leveraging all available data sources.  Evaluate the investment necessary to digitize the key activities of the companys value chain, and develop a multiyear budget and an overall roadmap balancing the capture of economic benets with the nancial burden on the cash ow.  Assess current personnel capabilities and develop a plan to address the gap. The talent upgrade plan should deal with decits in technical expertise and include a comprehensive set of actions to instruct those at the front line on how to change their way of working. Every oil and gas companys digital journey will differ, depending on their industry position, ambitions and opportunities. However, at a time when low oil and gas prices are restricting investment, this is one area of the business where cost has been decreasing and tools rapidly improvingso it should merit an increasing share of budget and focus. But whether a leader or fast follower, every oil and gas company will need a strategic plan that measures out short-term gains while building capabilities to develop long-term competitive advantage. Perhaps most important, they should all include details on how the ow of information necessitates changes to the operating model, and how each company plans to upgrade its talent and capabilities to make the most of its potential.

In an announcement, the AER said licence transfer applications will now be considered non-routine under its temporary new measures. It added that it will refuse to approve the transfer of AER licences, approvals and permits if the transaction results in the buyers asset value falling below two times the cost of its environmental liabilities. Currently, companies are only required to maintain an equal amount of assets and liabilities. AER spokesman Ryan Bartlett said 219 or 28 per cent of the 788 companies registered as licensees with the AER have a liability management ratio or LMR above the newly required 2.0. He said companies can improve their LMR by cleaning up old wellsites, posting security or revamping their proposed well transactions. Story continues below advertisement The regulator acknowledged its regulations may inconvenience some stakeholders but pointed out it wants to work with industry and the province to develop broader permanent regulatory measures. They are attempting to put a higher hurdle rate for acquirers of assets. That will have an impact and this is of deep concern to us, said Gary Leach, president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada. He said the new rules will reduce the number of potential buyers for assets his members are trying to sell. But he added the rules may be necessary to avoid increasing liabilities for the Alberta orphan well fund, an industry financed pool of money that is used to clean up well sites for owners who cant or wont do it themselves. READ MORE: Map: Alberta littered with inactive oil and gas wells This case has shaken up what was the old order and until theres a new order in place, whether its through legislative fixes or what, what were seeing is the regulator trying to stabilize the situation, said Leach.

The Alberta Court of Queens Bench ruled in May in the case of bankrupt producer Redwater Energy that the rights of lenders to be paid back ranks above the right of the provincial regulator to require the reclamation of oil and gas wells.

Minister of Energy, Manpower and Industry Hj Mat Suny said the investment aims to secure Brunei's petroleum industry, which makes up 57.3 percent of the country's economy. ""This is a huge investment to ensure that oil and gas production is sustainable in the future. This investment will bring about a significant economic impact on local entrepreneurs and the service industry,"" he said on Thursday's Legislative Council meeting. The minister said they will start drilling five new exploration wells, including two key wells, this year to determine the potential of the new locations. Hj Mat Suny also said that there are plans to look into deep water exploration in areas with a depth of two km. He said that the sultanate is also aiming to increase oil and gas production by 9,500 barrels per day this year, to 121,000 barrels per day from 111,500 barrels per day in 2018. The minister said that Hengyi Industries' oil refinery and petrochemical plant at Pulau Muara Besar (PMB)is expected to contribute to a more secure supply of domestic petroleum products this year. Hengyi Industries is a joint venture between China's Zhejiang Hengyi Group and Damai Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary under Brunei government's Strategic Development Capital Fund, with the two owning 70 percent and 30 percent of the joint venture respectively. Hengyi's investment into PMB is the largest foreign direct investment into Brunei from China so far, which is due to help the southeast Asian country to upgrade its industries, alleviate its dependency on oil import and also boost economic and trade cooperation between Brunei and China.

By Felicity Bradstock- May 01, 2021, 10:00 AM CDT Join Our Community Indian state-owned oil and gas producer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) is told to sell its stake in the countrys oil fields as part of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas seven-point plan to boost production after a year of limited production. According to a Press Trust of India (PTI) report the countrys Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is communicating with ONGC on how to increase oil output over the coming years. The plan, titled 'ONGC Way Forward', suggests that ONGC divests its stake in several onshore and offshore oil fields, including Panna-Mukta or Ratna, R-Series and the Gandhar field, as well as partnering with foreign oil and gas firms to develop its projects in the gas-rich block KG-DWN-98/2, Ashokenagar block in West Bengal and Deendayal block in the KG basin. The Ministry is also putting pressure on the ONGC to monetise existing infrastructure. Production in the $5-billion KG-DWN-98/2 project is expected to increase substantially over the next year, with peak production projected for 2024 . ONGC expects the fields to support around 2 million metric standard cubic metres per day (MMSCMD) of natural gas by the end of June. Additional fields operated by Reliance and British Petroleum in the Krishna Godavari basin will contribute to the increase in domestic natural gas production. The plan also looks to separate various oil services such as drilling, well services, logging, workover services and data processing entities. Related: Goldman: Oil To Hit $80 On Largest Ever Demand Jump Efforts are being made to increase national oil and gas production as ONGC crude production fell from 20.6 million tonnes at the end of fiscal year 2020 to 20.2 million tonnes in 2021. Gas production also decreased during the same time period. The plan hopes to see ONGC increase production levels by one-third by 2024. This plan represents the third attempt under the Modi government at convincing ONGC to privatise its marginal oil and gas fields to focus wholly on large producing fields to boost domestic production. The plan states that national production must increase production to 40 million tonnes of crude oil and 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas by fiscal year 2023-24 if India hopes to reduce its dependence on oil and gas imports and meet domestic needs. ONGC is expected to produce the majority of this target oil production, at around 70 percent of the countrys total oil and gas output, an increase of almost 8 million tonnes of crude on its present production levels. An official stated of the plan , Indias domestic crude oil production is constantly on a decline. It is mainly because ONGC, which contributes about 70% of the domestic output, is unable to ramp up production from existing fields and could not add new fields under production. Hence, the action plan. However, industry experts believe the plan could significantly weaken ONGC , with private partners profiting from the corporations existing discoveries in oil and gas, likely the reason that ONGC has, until now, resisted pressure from the Ministry to divide its assets and privatise. Yet, with Indias oil and gas production levels falling under ONGC since 2012, largely due to the reliance on low-output aging wells, it is clear that something must be done if the government hopes to increase domestic production levels. For example, boosting national production will likely require technologically intensive methods to benefit from more hard-to-access areas such as ultradeepwater fields, something ONGC is currently failing to achieve. While ONGC will likely resist the Oil Ministrys latest attempt at privatisation, it has become clear that the state-owned corporation must adapt in order to meet national oil and gas needs over the next decade.

(AP)  A judge has blocked oil and gas drilling on almost 500 square miles (1,295 sq. kilometers) in Wyoming and says the government must consider the cumulative climate change impact of leasing broad swaths of U.S. public lands for oil and gas exploration. The order marks the latest in a string of court rulings over the past decade  including one last month in Montana  that have faulted the U.S. for inadequate consideration of greenhouse gas emissions when issuing leases and permits for oil, gas or coal production. But U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington, D.C., appeared to go a step further than judges have previously in his order issued late Tuesday. Previous rulings focused on individual lease sales or permits. But Contreras said that when the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) auctions public lands for oil and gas leasing, officials must consider emissions from past, present and foreseeable future oil and gas leases nationwide. ""Given the national, cumulative nature of climate change, considering each individual drilling project in a vacuum deprives the agency and the public of the context necessary to evaluate oil and gas drilling on federal land,"" Contreras wrote. The ruling coincides with an aggressive push by President Donald Trump's administration to open more public lands to energy development. It came in a lawsuit that challenged leases issued in Wyoming, Utah and Colorado in 2015 and 2016, during President Barack Obama's administration. Only the leases in Wyoming were immediately addressed in Contreras' ruling, which blocks federal officials from issuing drilling permits until they conduct a new environmental review looking more closely at greenhouse gas emissions. Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Kristen Lenhardt said the agency was still reviewing the ruling and ""determining a path forward regarding the implications."" The case was brought by two advocacy groups, WildEarth Guardians and Physicians for Social Responsibility. WildEarth Guardians climate program director Jeremy Nichols predicted the ruling would have much bigger implications than a halt to drilling in some areas of Wyoming  assuming the government does what Contreras has asked. ""This is the Holy Grail ruling we've been after, especially with oil and gas,"" said Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians climate program director. ""It calls into question the legality of oil and gas leasing that's happening everywhere."" The BLM already does the correct analysis of greenhouse gas effects at the leasing stage, which changes once it knows whether and how many oil and gas wells might be drilled on leased land, an oil and gas industry group said. ""The judge is asking BLM to take a wild guess at how many wells would be developed on these leases,"" said Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. ___ Gruver reported from Cheyenne, Wyoming.

IANS May 01, 2021, 17:02 IST New Delhi: Fuel prices in the country remained unchanged on Saturday as oil marketing companies decided to wait and watch the situation prevailing in global oil markets before restarting daily revision of petroland dieselprices. Sources indicated that price revisions may begin anytime next week after results to state elections are declared. However, whether the price of petrol and diesel would move up or down then would depend on the actual average global price in the last fortnight of March. OMCs benchmark retail fuel prices to a 15-day rolling average of global refined products' prices and dollar exchange rate. With no price change on Saturday, pump price of petrol and diesel remained at Rs 90.40 a litre and Rs 80.73 a litre respective in Delhi. This is 16 consecutive day when fuel prices have not been revised. The price of the two auto fuels had fallen by 16 paisa and 14 paisa per litre respectively on April 15 after a 15 day break when OMCs kept its prices static. Thereafter revision of fuel prices has been halted. Across the country as well the petrol and diesel price remained unchanged on Saturday but its retail levels varied depending on the level of local levies in respective states. Premium petrol, however, continues to remain over Rs 100 a litre in Mumbaiand several other cities across the country. The OMCs went on price cut for the first time this year on two consecutive days - March 24 and 25 after keeping oil prices steady for past 24 days. It again reduced the price on March 30. Thereafter, fuel prices have remained unchanged for past 15 days before falling again on April 15. In all petrol prices have fallen by 77 paisa per litre while diesel by 74 paisa per litre in 2021 so far. Earlier, petrol and diesel prices increased 26 times in 2021 with the two auto fuels increasing by Rs 7.46 and Rs 7.60 per litre respectively so far this year. With global crude prices at over $67 a barrel mark, OMCs may have revise fuel prices upwards again if there is any further firming up.

There are an estimated 200,000 of them, and the cost to plug them could exceed $6 billion. The states orphan well plugging program has been underfunded for decades, but it is primed to take advantage of an influx of cash. Part of President Joe Bidens $2.3 trillion proposal to upgrade the nations infrastructure would dedicate $16 billion to reclaiming abandoned wells and mines across the U.S. Cementing shut wells that were left behind during more than a century of drilling has emerged as a popular policy in the past year. It bridges environmental groups  who want to cap scattered hazards that leak brine, oil and methane, a powerful greenhouse gas  and oil and gas companies  who see it as a growth area for their business as drilling declines. It isnt certain that every item in the Biden administrations sweeping infrastructure proposal will end up in final legislation before Congress or that a broad infrastructure bill will pass. But there appears to be bipartisan coast-to-coast support for stimulus for orphan well plugging and remediation, said Adam Peltz, a senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund. Theres good reason for optimism that it will occur at some point this year. Looking for lost wells Pennsylvania environmental regulators and the states conventional oil and gas industry have spent years drawing attention to the dire need for more funding and studying ways to plug vastly more abandoned wells. The Department of Environmental Protection has lined up 500 priority and nearby wells that could be bid right away when stimulus funding arrives. The federal money, if it comes through, would be the opportunity of a lifetime, said Seth Pelepko, environmental program manager at the oil and gas bureau. A lot of what we do right now is looking for sources of money, looking for partnerships, he said. Instead, his six-person team could turn to executing a plugging program for the 8,700 verified wells on Pennsylvanias abandoned wells list and identifying the several hundred thousand wells that are believed to be scattered around the state but not yet on the list. Bills introduced in the U.S. House and Senate in recent weeks would dedicate between $5 billion and $8 billion to plugging orphan wells, with the bulk of the funds dispersed to states through grants administered by the Department of the Interior. Both proposals include initial grants of up to $25 million to states with established well cleanup programs, like Pennsylvania, that can quickly sign contracts to use a surge of funding within months. More money would then be sent to states to be spent over five years using formulas based on a states inventory of orphan wells and its recent oil and gas job losses. The bills would also reward states with tens of millions of dollars in additional grants for pumping more state money into well plugging and strengthening regulations to prevent more wells from being abandoned. Even a fraction of the proposed cash would be more money than Pennsylvanias well plugging program has ever seen. During its best funding year ever, in 2008, the department had $3.5 million to spend on plugging abandoned wells, in part because significant funding from the states Growing Greener environmental investment initiative was channeled to the program. Contractors plugged about 250 abandoned wells that year. Now, the program is funded primarily by $150 to $250 surcharges on new well drilling permits  a fee rate the Legislature has not raised since 1992  and plugging has slowed substantially. DEPs abandoned well plugging budget last year was $720,000. Old wells maymean old tools With its meager and unpredictable budget, Mr. Pelepko said, the agency has kept its focus on the worst of the worst wells  those that pose the greatest public health and environmental risks. Emergency plugging projects often demand a large chunk of the available funding. DEP recently spent $350,000 to plug a single well in a front yard in Franklin Park that was releasing so much methane through the soil that workers could put a garbage bag on the ground and fill it up with the flammable gas, Mr. Pelepko said during a presentation in January. Story continues below video For an average well, DEPs well plugging costs are about $33,000. Arthur Stewart, chairman of the Pennsylvania Grade Crude Development Advisory Council, said in northwestern Pennsylvania, where his company, Cameron Energy, is based, old wells can be plugged for $15,000  as long as they are intact. But wells sitting idle, exposed to changing environmental conditions, can experience a devastating amount of decay. Often fishing obstructions out of abandoned wells takes up most of the labor before cement can be poured. During a presentation to DEPs Citizens Advisory Council in January, he showed a photo of a garage filled with racks of tools his company uses to plug old and abandoned wells. It looked like an exhibit from an industrial heritage museum. There are not many people in Pennsylvania let alone the world who still own tools like these to do the fishing thats required to get to the bottom of these ancient wells, he said. Pennsylvanias conventional oil and gas industry is especially well positioned to benefit from a large-scale abandoned well plugging program that will require the expertise of people accustomed to dealing with old tools and old wells. It is also eager to reverse a decade of decline before generational expertise is lost. Looking for work Companies  some startups, others industry veterans that once made a living drilling shallow wells before that work dried up in the past decade  are taking notice of the possibilities. In 2020, veterans of Downtown-based shale gas giant EQT Corp. founded Next LVL Energy, which aims to be the Appalachian Basins most specialized, efficient and cost-effective plugging service provider. Mr. Pelepko said he has seen smaller drilling companies refocus on the plugging opportunities as development drilling has slowed. The departments list of approved plugging contractors has grown from a handful to a few dozen in the past several years, in part because the agency made an effort to track down capable companies. That list will also give the agency a leg up when stimulus funding arrives, Mr. Pelepko said. A plugging program could be an opportunity for oil and gas workers displaced during the recent downturn. DEP estimates that 300 jobs are created for every $25 million invested in abandoned well plugging. Rob Greathouse started his plugging company, S&T Services & Supply, in 1988. For the first two decades, S&T was plugging about 250 wells a year. But in recent years that has dropped to just a few dozen because all the easy ones are done, he said. Mr. Greathouse was working on a stubborn old well in Clarion County w",https://www.ncnewsonline.com/news/local_news/infrastructure-money-could-aid-push-to-plug-oil-gas-wells/article_999fa25e-0344-588a-84aa-83bcc2cb4060.html

In April, TAE Technologies  which was founded in 1998  announced it was able to produce stable plasma at more than 50 million degrees Celsius with its Field Reversed Configuration, or FRC, machine. The machine is nicknamed Norman, after Binderbauers late mentor, Norman Rostoker , one of the Popes of the field, he says. While that milestone is important, it is not the hottest temperature generated in a fusion lab. The Chinese and Koreans have achieved over 100 million degrees in their tokamaks [fusion machines]  a very different kind of experiment, says , executive director of the Fusion Industry Association. The video embedded below shows plasma being formed and maintained inside TAEs fusion machine. A different kind of fusion reactor Typically, the donut-shaped tokamak machines that Holland mentioned are used to attempt fusion. But TAEs FRC reactor is less expensive to construct and repair and its system is less complex, according to Binderbauer. TAEs FRC machine Norman, seen in the photos and in the video embedded below, cost $150 million to construct and was built from mid-2016 to mid-2017. It is 80 feet long and 22 feet high and weighs 60,000 pounds. The machine works by first creating an internal vacuum. Then we introduce a handful of particles  about a million times less dense than the air we sit in in the room  so the amount of particles in there is tiny, Binderbauer tells CNBC Make It. In each of the ends of the machine, hydrogen gas is heated to form a plasma. The two plasmas are then slammed together in the middle portion of the machine. See that in the video clip embedded below. Particle beam accelerators (seen in the photos below with yellow ends) hold the slammed-together plasma in place so that fusion can happen. As we shift out of the scientific validation phase into engineering commercial-scale solutions for both our fusion and power management technologies, TAE will become a significant contributor in modernizing the entire energy grid, Binderbauer said in a written statement announcing the companys latest funding raise.Photo courtesy: TAE Technologies, fusion TAE Technologies uses of hydrogen-boron fuel, which is the cleanest, most environmentally friendly fuel source on Earth, with no harmful primary byproducts and enough natural supply to sustain the planet for virtually 100,000 years, says Binderbauer. As a species we would likely be extinct by our own doing before we run out of this fuel. But using hydrogen-boron, requires much much higher temperatures to achieve fusion, so is much more difficult, Holland says. Getting to 50 million degrees Celsius earned TAE a $280 million infusion of money in April from investors including Vulcan, Venrock, NEA, Wellcome Trust, Google and the Kuwait Investment Authority, as well as the family offices of Addison Fischer, Art Samberg, and Charles Schwab. In total, TAE Technologies has raised $880 million from investors. But 50 million degrees Celsius is still not hot enough to create what is called net energy. With the present technology, fusion usurps all the energy it creates to sustain its own reaction, leaving no net energy to power other things. To achieve net energy, TAE will use the recent funding to build a next generation FRC, called Copernicus, a rendering of which is embedded below. It will operate well in excess of 100 million degrees Celsius to simulate net energy production, according to an April statement from TAE. This is a rendering of Copernicus, the next generation fusion machine TAE Technologies is going to build.Rendering courtesy TAE Technologies. The design of Copernicus, which looks similar to Norman, is still being finalized. The future of fusion Our game plan, the one we have been executing to, is to bring a demonstration power plant online by the late part of the 20s, so then you go into commercialization, Binderbauer says. But one of the common criticisms of fusion is that it is going to take too long to be realized to be helpful with climate change. Fusion has great potential to contribute to a clean energy future, says Jonathan Cobb, senior analyst at the . But even if net energy is achieved in the 2020s, widespread deployment of fusion is someway off.

Under the amendment, the number of common shares that may be repurchased will increase from 50,000 common shares to up to four percent of its 734,076,755 outstanding common shares as of June 15, 2020, or a maximum of 29,363,070 shares during the 12-month period from June 29, 2020 to June 28, 2021. This amended maximum will be reduced by the number of shares purchased from Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil), Imperials majority shareholder, as described below. No other terms of the NCIB have been amended. Purchases under the amended NCIB are eligible to begin on May 5, 2021. The NCIB will end should the company purchase the maximum allowable number of shares, or on June 28, 2021. Consistent with the companys balance sheet strength, low capital requirements and strong cash generation, this amendment reflects the companys priority and capacity to return cash to shareholders. The normal course issuer bid represents a flexible and tax-efficient way of distributing surplus liquidity to shareholders who choose to participate by selling their shares. ExxonMobil will be permitted to sell its shares to Imperial outside of, but concurrent with, the NCIB in order to maintain its proportionate share ownership at approximately 69.6 percent. ExxonMobil advised Imperial that it intends to participate, as it has in prior years. All share purchases will be made through the TSX and through other designated exchanges and published markets in Canada. Shares purchased under the NCIB are restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares. Under its current NCIB, as of April 29, 2021, Imperial has purchased 6,975 shares on the open market and no shares from ExxonMobil to maintain its proportionate share ownership at 69.6 percent. These purchases were made to eliminate dilution from shares issued in conjunction with Imperials restricted stock unit plan, representing a total cost of about $170,000 and an average cost of $24.34 per share. After more than a century, Imperial continues to be an industry leader in applying technology and innovation to responsibly develop Canadas energy resources.

Simmons On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate voted to reinstate a duplicative 2016 air emissions rule that will cost the oil and natural gas industrys smallest producers and transmission sector greatly while providing little public benefit. The 52-42 vote in the upper chamber of Congress is just another alarm that the regulatory onslaught aimed at eliminating the U.S. oil and natural gas industry is underway with both lawmakers and the public overwhelmed by a mishmash of confusing climate rhetoric. When considering the Senate action, it is important to note that the rules already required well operators to use equipment to reduce air emissions identical to the controls necessary to reduce methane emissions. The Trump-era rewrite provided clarity and balance. Oil and natural gas producers whose main line of business is owning and managing marginally producing wells will be hurt the most by reinstating the regulation. Typically small businesses with 10 or fewer employees, marginal well operators will now be faced with retrofitting decades-old wells to meet new regulatory standards at a cost that will often exceed the annual revenue from an individual well. Even President Obama acknowledged the negative impact the emission regulations would have on small businesses and exempted them from meeting the increased standards when they were put in place. Marginal well operators play an important role in Oklahomas oil and natural gas industry and our states economy as a whole. Individually, marginal wells produce less than 10 barrels of oil per day, but as a collective, the marginal wells in Oklahoma account for roughly 15% of the states oil and natural gas production. By increasing the oil and natural gas industrys regulatory burden and costs, the federal government continues to jeopardize the foundation upon which Oklahomas economy is built. Faced with increasing costs that make marginally economic wells even less so, some producers will opt to shut down those wells, stopping the flow of oil and natural gas that powers Americas progress, eliminating the jobs associated with them and reducing the tax dollars paid on oil and natural gas production. It wont stop here. The regulatory onslaught will continue, and Oklahomas oil-and-gas-driven economy will pay the price. Elections have consequences. Brook A. Simmons is president of the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma.",https://journalrecord.com/2021/04/30/simmons-federal-bullying-threatens-small-oil-and-gas-producers/

U.S. energy firms added oil and natural gas rigs this week, leading to a ninth straight monthly rig count increase, as a recovery in prices lured some drillers back to the well pad. Theoil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose two to 440 in the week to April 30, its highest since April 2020, Baker Hughes Co. said in its weekly report. That was the sixth time the count increased in the past seven weeks and put the total number up 32, or 8%, over this time last year. It was also up 80% since falling to a record low of 244 in August 2020, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1940. This week was the first time the current rig count rose over the year ago since April 2019 due in part to the massive 263 rig drop in the number of units operating in April 2020 when energy demand destruction from the coronavirus caused oil futures to turn negative. For the month, the total count rose 23 rigs, increasing for a ninth month in a row for the first time since July 2017. Oil rigs rose for an eighth straight month to their highest since April 2020. U.S. oil rigs fell one to 342 this week, while gas rigs rose two to 96, their highest since April 2020. U.S. crude futures were trading around $64 per barrel April 30, putting the contract on track to rise for a fifth time in the past six months. With prices mostly rising since November 2020, some energy firms plan to boost spending in 2021 after cutting drilling and completion expenditures over the past two years. That spending increase, however, remains small as most firms continue to focus on boosting cash flow, reducing debt and increasing shareholder returns rather than adding output. Exxon Mobil Corp.s capital spending fell to $3.1 billion in the first quarter, the lowest in nearly two decades. The top U.S. oil producer covered its spending and dividend with cash flow for the first time since the third quarter of 2018. Chevron Corp. said capital spending for the first quarter was $2.5 billion, down from $4.4 billion in the same period last year. The second-largest U.S. oil producer will restrain spending this year, including in shale. The stock markets are not sending a signal to us or our sector to increase capital, CFO Pierre Breber said. Crude oil output in the U.S. fell dropped by over a million barrels per day (MMbbl/d) in February, falling to 9.862 MMbbl/d, its lowest levels since October 2017, according to a monthly government report. Februarys data is the first time that oil production has dropped below 10 MMbbl/d since January 2018, according to the agency. The output drop came as a freeze in Texas shut in some production, but declines were also seen in other major oil-producing states. Monthly gross natural gas production in the U.S. Lower 48 states fell by 7.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), the biggest monthly decline on record, to 94.8 Bcf/d in February, the government said.",https://www.hartenergy.com/news/us-oil-rig-count-dips-gas-rig-count-inches-193855

On a conference call Monday announcing the deal, GE Oil & Gas CEO Lorenzo Simonelli dismissed potential regulatory issues, saying only, ""We are confident of going forward."" Whatever happens, the deal may spur other deals in the oilfield services industry, which has already seen Schlumberger purchase Cameron International for $14.8 billion and FMC Technologies Inc. (NYSE:FTI) announce a merger with France's Technip SA to create a $13 billion oilfield services that can better compete with Schlumberger and Halliburton. Hallead seesHalliburton and National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NYSE:NOV) as those best positioned to be acquirers, although hethinks it's unlikely that the latter ""dramatically alters course"" with a large acquisition. On the target side, Halleadthinks Oceaneering International Inc. (NYSE:OII), Oil States International Inc. (NYSE:OIS) and Weatherford International plc (NYSE:WFT) stand out as attractive merger candidates. Indeed, some see Halliburton purchasing Weatherford, whichwould bring artificial lift and consolidation of directional drilling and production equipment along with a topcementing business tothe company. But Weatherford probably doesn't want to sell at the bottom of the cycle and Halliburton may not want to try another large acquisitionso soon after the failed Baker Hughes tie-up, observers say.

But its also thanks to new rules imposed last spring by the Alberta Energy Regulator to prevent financially shaky companies from running up reclamation liabilities to unaffordable levels. The AER rules, in short, say that if a proposed oil and gas transaction results in the estimated value of a companys assets falling to less than twice its future reclamation liabilities the province may require payment of a deposit to ensure cleanup. If the deposit isnt made, the province can refuse to transfer the Crown licence to the new owner, essentially scuttling the deal. Watch below from October 2015: Who pays the clean-up tab when an oil company goes bust? 169 takes a look at abandoned wells in Canada. To determine if a company will be required to pay a deposit, the AER calculates its licensee liability rating or LLR  and the higher the rating, the better the chance of being free to buy and sell oil and gas properties. Story continues below advertisement Federal budget 2016  Oil well cleanup proponents left empty-handed Previously, companies were allowed to have an LLR as low as 1.0 before being restricted. Now companies must have an LLR of at least 2.0. Regulations have become a lot more stringent with respect to the LLR  and specifically the amount of unfunded liability the companies are carrying, said Dave Humphreys, vice-president of operations at Calgary-based intermediate producer Birchcliff Energy (TSX:BIR), which boasts a high LLR of about 12.0. Companies are going to have to get with the program or not be able to do deals. Tweet This Humphreys said it can take two to five years to obtain a provincial reclamation certificate after the company decides to abandon a well, depending on the cleanup work required. Birchcliff expects to receive six certificates this year and nine next year after receiving none in 2015 and six in 2014. According to the AER, the average LLR among 775 licensed companies as of Oct. 1 was 4.36. It says 349 licensees  45 per cent  had LLRs below 1.0, which will make it difficult for them to buy assets.

RBC Dominion Securities oil and gas analyst Shailender Randhawa said in a recent research note he believes producers are budgeting to spend more on reclamations.

Nichols, meanwhile, said one well on his farmland has been producing cheques for 23 years despite never actually producing commercial volumes of oil or gas for its owner, Apache Canada. Were not pushing them. That one there, we farm right over it, he said. Right now theres swathed barley on top of it. Apache spokesman Paul Wyke said three of the companys five wells on the Nichols land have been scheduled for reclamation over the next two years, including the one drilled in 1993 that has failed testing and therefore never been produced.

Minister of Energy, Manpower and Industry Hj Mat Suny said the investment aims to secure Brunei's petroleum industry, which makes up 57.3 percent of the country's economy. ""This is a huge investment to ensure that oil and gas production is sustainable in the future. This investment will bring about a significant economic impact on local entrepreneurs and the service industry,"" he said on Thursday's Legislative Council meeting. The minister said they will start drilling five new exploration wells, including two key wells, this year to determine the potential of the new locations. Hj Mat Suny also said that there are plans to look into deep water exploration in areas with a depth of two km. He said that the sultanate is also aiming to increase oil and gas production by 9,500 barrels per day this year, to 121,000 barrels per day from 111,500 barrels per day in 2018. The minister said that Hengyi Industries' oil refinery and petrochemical plant at Pulau Muara Besar (PMB)is expected to contribute to a more secure supply of domestic petroleum products this year. Hengyi Industries is a joint venture between China's Zhejiang Hengyi Group and Damai Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary under Brunei government's Strategic Development Capital Fund, with the two owning 70 percent and 30 percent of the joint venture respectively. Hengyi's investment into PMB is the largest foreign direct investment into Brunei from China so far, which is due to help the southeast Asian country to upgrade its industries, alleviate its dependency on oil import and also boost economic and trade cooperation between Brunei and China.

oilprice,NotProvided,2021-05-01 15:00:00,What Will Privatization Mean For Indias Burgeoning Oil Industry?,"India is pushing a new plan to privatize its state-owned oil and gas producer, but with this attempt prove successful?","What Will Privatization Mean For Indias Burgeoning Oil Industry? By Felicity Bradstock- May 01, 2021, 10:00 AM CDT Join Our Community Indian state-owned oil and gas producer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) is told to sell its stake in the countrys oil fields as part of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas seven-point plan to boost production after a year of limited production. According to a Press Trust of India (PTI) report the countrys Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is communicating with ONGC on how to increase oil output over the coming years. The plan, titled 'ONGC Way Forward', suggests that ONGC divests its stake in several onshore and offshore oil fields, including Panna-Mukta or Ratna, R-Series and the Gandhar field, as well as partnering with foreign oil and gas firms to develop its projects in the gas-rich block KG-DWN-98/2, Ashokenagar block in West Bengal and Deendayal block in the KG basin. The Ministry is also putting pressure on the ONGC to monetise existing infrastructure. Production in the $5-billion KG-DWN-98/2 project is expected to increase substantially over the next year, with peak production projected for 2024 . ONGC expects the fields to support around 2 million metric standard cubic metres per day (MMSCMD) of natural gas by the end of June. Additional fields operated by Reliance and British Petroleum in the Krishna Godavari basin will contribute to the increase in domestic natural gas production. The plan also looks to separate various oil services such as drilling, well services, logging, workover services and data processing entities. Related: Goldman: Oil To Hit $80 On Largest Ever Demand Jump Efforts are being made to increase national oil and gas production as ONGC crude production fell from 20.6 million tonnes at the end of fiscal year 2020 to 20.2 million tonnes in 2021. Gas production also decreased during the same time period. The plan hopes to see ONGC increase production levels by one-third by 2024. This plan represents the third attempt under the Modi government at convincing ONGC to privatise its marginal oil and gas fields to focus wholly on large producing fields to boost domestic production. The plan states that national production must increase production to 40 million tonnes of crude oil and 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas by fiscal year 2023-24 if India hopes to reduce its dependence on oil and gas imports and meet domestic needs. ONGC is expected to produce the majority of this target oil production, at around 70 percent of the countrys total oil and gas output, an increase of almost 8 million tonnes of crude on its present production levels. An official stated of the plan , Indias domestic crude oil production is constantly on a decline. It is mainly because ONGC, which contributes about 70% of the domestic output, is unable to ramp up production from existing fields and could not add new fields under production. Hence, the action plan. However, industry experts believe the plan could significantly weaken ONGC , with private partners profiting from the corporations existing discoveries in oil and gas, likely the reason that ONGC has, until now, resisted pressure from the Ministry to divide its assets and privatise. Yet, with Indias oil and gas production levels falling under ONGC since 2012, largely due to the reliance on low-output aging wells, it is clear that something must be done if the government hopes to increase domestic production levels. For example, boosting national production will likely require technologically intensive methods to benefit from more hard-to-access areas such as ultradeepwater fields, something ONGC is currently failing to achieve. While ONGC will likely resist the Oil Ministrys latest attempt at privatisation, it has become clear that the state-owned corporation must adapt in order to meet national oil and gas needs over the next decade.

(AP)  A judge has blocked oil and gas drilling on almost 500 square miles (1,295 sq. kilometers) in Wyoming and says the government must consider the cumulative climate change impact of leasing broad swaths of U.S. public lands for oil and gas exploration. The order marks the latest in a string of court rulings over the past decade  including one last month in Montana  that have faulted the U.S. for inadequate consideration of greenhouse gas emissions when issuing leases and permits for oil, gas or coal production. But U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington, D.C., appeared to go a step further than judges have previously in his order issued late Tuesday. Previous rulings focused on individual lease sales or permits. But Contreras said that when the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) auctions public lands for oil and gas leasing, officials must consider emissions from past, present and foreseeable future oil and gas leases nationwide. ""Given the national, cumulative nature of climate change, considering each individual drilling project in a vacuum deprives the agency and the public of the context necessary to evaluate oil and gas drilling on federal land,"" Contreras wrote. The ruling coincides with an aggressive push by President Donald Trump's administration to open more public lands to energy development. It came in a lawsuit that challenged leases issued in Wyoming, Utah and Colorado in 2015 and 2016, during President Barack Obama's administration. Only the leases in Wyoming were immediately addressed in Contreras' ruling, which blocks federal officials from issuing drilling permits until they conduct a new environmental review looking more closely at greenhouse gas emissions. Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Kristen Lenhardt said the agency was still reviewing the ruling and ""determining a path forward regarding the implications."" The case was brought by two advocacy groups, WildEarth Guardians and Physicians for Social Responsibility. WildEarth Guardians climate program director Jeremy Nichols predicted the ruling would have much bigger implications than a halt to drilling in some areas of Wyoming  assuming the government does what Contreras has asked. ""This is the Holy Grail ruling we've been after, especially with oil and gas,"" said Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians climate program director. ""It calls into question the legality of oil and gas leasing that's happening everywhere."" The BLM already does the correct analysis of greenhouse gas effects at the leasing stage, which changes once it knows whether and how many oil and gas wells might be drilled on leased land, an oil and gas industry group said. ""The judge is asking BLM to take a wild guess at how many wells would be developed on these leases,"" said Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. ___ Gruver reported from Cheyenne, Wyoming.

There are an estimated 200,000 of them, and the cost to plug them could exceed $6 billion. The states orphan well plugging program has been underfunded for decades, but it is primed to take advantage of an influx of cash. Part of President Joe Bidens $2.3 trillion proposal to upgrade the nations infrastructure would dedicate $16 billion to reclaiming abandoned wells and mines across the U.S. Cementing shut wells that were left behind during more than a century of drilling has emerged as a popular policy in the past year. It bridges environmental groups  who want to cap scattered hazards that leak brine, oil and methane, a powerful greenhouse gas  and oil and gas companies  who see it as a growth area for their business as drilling declines. It isnt certain that every item in the Biden administrations sweeping infrastructure proposal will end up in final legislation before Congress or that a broad infrastructure bill will pass. But there appears to be bipartisan coast-to-coast support for stimulus for orphan well plugging and remediation, said Adam Peltz, a senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund. Theres good reason for optimism that it will occur at some point this year. Looking for lost wells Pennsylvania environmental regulators and the states conventional oil and gas industry have spent years drawing attention to the dire need for more funding and studying ways to plug vastly more abandoned wells. The Department of Environmental Protection has lined up 500 priority and nearby wells that could be bid right away when stimulus funding arrives. The federal money, if it comes through, would be the opportunity of a lifetime, said Seth Pelepko, environmental program manager at the oil and gas bureau. A lot of what we do right now is looking for sources of money, looking for partnerships, he said. Instead, his six-person team could turn to executing a plugging program for the 8,700 verified wells on Pennsylvanias abandoned wells list and identifying the several hundred thousand wells that are believed to be scattered around the state but not yet on the list. Bills introduced in the U.S. House and Senate in recent weeks would dedicate between $5 billion and $8 billion to plugging orphan wells, with the bulk of the funds dispersed to states through grants administered by the Department of the Interior. Both proposals include initial grants of up to $25 million to states with established well cleanup programs, like Pennsylvania, that can quickly sign contracts to use a surge of funding within months. More money would then be sent to states to be spent over five years using formulas based on a states inventory of orphan wells and its recent oil and gas job losses. The bills would also reward states with tens of millions of dollars in additional grants for pumping more state money into well plugging and strengthening regulations to prevent more wells from being abandoned. Even a fraction of the proposed cash would be more money than Pennsylvanias well plugging program has ever seen. During its best funding year ever, in 2008, the department had $3.5 million to spend on plugging abandoned wells, in part because significant funding from the states Growing Greener environmental investment initiative was channeled to the program. Contractors plugged about 250 abandoned wells that year. Now, the program is funded primarily by $150 to $250 surcharges on new well drilling permits  a fee rate the Legislature has not raised since 1992  and plugging has slowed substantially. DEPs abandoned well plugging budget last year was $720,000. Old wells maymean old tools With its meager and unpredictable budget, Mr. Pelepko said, the agency has kept its focus on the worst of the worst wells  those that pose the greatest public health and environmental risks. Emergency plugging projects often demand a large chunk of the available funding. DEP recently spent $350,000 to plug a single well in a front yard in Franklin Park that was releasing so much methane through the soil that workers could put a garbage bag on the ground and fill it up with the flammable gas, Mr. Pelepko said during a presentation in January. Story continues below video For an average well, DEPs well plugging costs are about $33,000. Arthur Stewart, chairman of the Pennsylvania Grade Crude Development Advisory Council, said in northwestern Pennsylvania, where his company, Cameron Energy, is based, old wells can be plugged for $15,000  as long as they are intact. But wells sitting idle, exposed to changing environmental conditions, can experience a devastating amount of decay. Often fishing obstructions out of abandoned wells takes up most of the labor before cement can be poured. During a presentation to DEPs Citizens Advisory Council in January, he showed a photo of a garage filled with racks of tools his company uses to plug old and abandoned wells. It looked like an exhibit from an industrial heritage museum. There are not many people in Pennsylvania let alone the world who still own tools like these to do the fishing thats required to get to the bottom of these ancient wells, he said. Pennsylvanias conventional oil and gas industry is especially well positioned to benefit from a large-scale abandoned well plugging program that will require the expertise of people accustomed to dealing with old tools and old wells. It is also eager to reverse a decade of decline before generational expertise is lost. Looking for work Companies  some startups, others industry veterans that once made a living drilling shallow wells before that work dried up in the past decade  are taking notice of the possibilities. In 2020, veterans of Downtown-based shale gas giant EQT Corp. founded Next LVL Energy, which aims to be the Appalachian Basins most specialized, efficient and cost-effective plugging service provider. Mr. Pelepko said he has seen smaller drilling companies refocus on the plugging opportunities as development drilling has slowed. The departments list of approved plugging contractors has grown from a handful to a few dozen in the past several years, in part because the agency made an effort to track down capable companies. That list will also give the agency a leg up when stimulus funding arrives, Mr. Pelepko said. A plugging program could be an opportunity for oil and gas workers displaced during the recent downturn. DEP estimates that 300 jobs are created for every $25 million invested in abandoned well plugging. Rob Greathouse started his plugging company, S&T Services & Supply, in 1988. For the first two decades, S&T was plugging about 250 wells a year. But in recent years that has dropped to just a few dozen because all the easy ones are done, he said. Mr. Greathouse was working on a stubborn old well in Clarion County w",https://www.ncnewsonline.com/news/local_news/infrastructure-money-could-aid-push-to-plug-oil-gas-wells/article_999fa25e-0344-588a-84aa-83bcc2cb4060.html

In April, TAE Technologies  which was founded in 1998  announced it was able to produce stable plasma at more than 50 million degrees Celsius with its Field Reversed Configuration, or FRC, machine. The machine is nicknamed Norman, after Binderbauers late mentor, Norman Rostoker , one of the Popes of the field, he says. While that milestone is important, it is not the hottest temperature generated in a fusion lab. The Chinese and Koreans have achieved over 100 million degrees in their tokamaks [fusion machines]  a very different kind of experiment, says , executive director of the Fusion Industry Association. The video embedded below shows plasma being formed and maintained inside TAEs fusion machine. A different kind of fusion reactor Typically, the donut-shaped tokamak machines that Holland mentioned are used to attempt fusion. But TAEs FRC reactor is less expensive to construct and repair and its system is less complex, according to Binderbauer. TAEs FRC machine Norman, seen in the photos and in the video embedded below, cost $150 million to construct and was built from mid-2016 to mid-2017. It is 80 feet long and 22 feet high and weighs 60,000 pounds. The machine works by first creating an internal vacuum. Then we introduce a handful of particles  about a million times less dense than the air we sit in in the room  so the amount of particles in there is tiny, Binderbauer tells CNBC Make It. In each of the ends of the machine, hydrogen gas is heated to form a plasma. The two plasmas are then slammed together in the middle portion of the machine. See that in the video clip embedded below. Particle beam accelerators (seen in the photos below with yellow ends) hold the slammed-together plasma in place so that fusion can happen. As we shift out of the scientific validation phase into engineering commercial-scale solutions for both our fusion and power management technologies, TAE will become a significant contributor in modernizing the entire energy grid, Binderbauer said in a written statement announcing the companys latest funding raise.Photo courtesy: TAE Technologies, fusion TAE Technologies uses of hydrogen-boron fuel, which is the cleanest, most environmentally friendly fuel source on Earth, with no harmful primary byproducts and enough natural supply to sustain the planet for virtually 100,000 years, says Binderbauer. As a species we would likely be extinct by our own doing before we run out of this fuel. But using hydrogen-boron, requires much much higher temperatures to achieve fusion, so is much more difficult, Holland says. Getting to 50 million degrees Celsius earned TAE a $280 million infusion of money in April from investors including Vulcan, Venrock, NEA, Wellcome Trust, Google and the Kuwait Investment Authority, as well as the family offices of Addison Fischer, Art Samberg, and Charles Schwab. In total, TAE Technologies has raised $880 million from investors. But 50 million degrees Celsius is still not hot enough to create what is called net energy. With the present technology, fusion usurps all the energy it creates to sustain its own reaction, leaving no net energy to power other things. To achieve net energy, TAE will use the recent funding to build a next generation FRC, called Copernicus, a rendering of which is embedded below. It will operate well in excess of 100 million degrees Celsius to simulate net energy production, according to an April statement from TAE. This is a rendering of Copernicus, the next generation fusion machine TAE Technologies is going to build.Rendering courtesy TAE Technologies. The design of Copernicus, which looks similar to Norman, is still being finalized. The future of fusion Our game plan, the one we have been executing to, is to bring a demonstration power plant online by the late part of the 20s, so then you go into commercialization, Binderbauer says. But one of the common criticisms of fusion is that it is going to take too long to be realized to be helpful with climate change. Fusion has great potential to contribute to a clean energy future, says Jonathan Cobb, senior analyst at the . But even if net energy is achieved in the 2020s, widespread deployment of fusion is someway off.

Under the amendment, the number of common shares that may be repurchased will increase from 50,000 common shares to up to four percent of its 734,076,755 outstanding common shares as of June 15, 2020, or a maximum of 29,363,070 shares during the 12-month period from June 29, 2020 to June 28, 2021. This amended maximum will be reduced by the number of shares purchased from Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil), Imperials majority shareholder, as described below. No other terms of the NCIB have been amended. Purchases under the amended NCIB are eligible to begin on May 5, 2021. The NCIB will end should the company purchase the maximum allowable number of shares, or on June 28, 2021. Consistent with the companys balance sheet strength, low capital requirements and strong cash generation, this amendment reflects the companys priority and capacity to return cash to shareholders. The normal course issuer bid represents a flexible and tax-efficient way of distributing surplus liquidity to shareholders who choose to participate by selling their shares. ExxonMobil will be permitted to sell its shares to Imperial outside of, but concurrent with, the NCIB in order to maintain its proportionate share ownership at approximately 69.6 percent. ExxonMobil advised Imperial that it intends to participate, as it has in prior years. All share purchases will be made through the TSX and through other designated exchanges and published markets in Canada. Shares purchased under the NCIB are restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares. Under its current NCIB, as of April 29, 2021, Imperial has purchased 6,975 shares on the open market and no shares from ExxonMobil to maintain its proportionate share ownership at 69.6 percent. These purchases were made to eliminate dilution from shares issued in conjunction with Imperials restricted stock unit plan, representing a total cost of about $170,000 and an average cost of $24.34 per share. After more than a century, Imperial continues to be an industry leader in applying technology and innovation to responsibly develop Canadas energy resources.

Simmons On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate voted to reinstate a duplicative 2016 air emissions rule that will cost the oil and natural gas industrys smallest producers and transmission sector greatly while providing little public benefit. The 52-42 vote in the upper chamber of Congress is just another alarm that the regulatory onslaught aimed at eliminating the U.S. oil and natural gas industry is underway with both lawmakers and the public overwhelmed by a mishmash of confusing climate rhetoric. When considering the Senate action, it is important to note that the rules already required well operators to use equipment to reduce air emissions identical to the controls necessary to reduce methane emissions. The Trump-era rewrite provided clarity and balance. Oil and natural gas producers whose main line of business is owning and managing marginally producing wells will be hurt the most by reinstating the regulation. Typically small businesses with 10 or fewer employees, marginal well operators will now be faced with retrofitting decades-old wells to meet new regulatory standards at a cost that will often exceed the annual revenue from an individual well. Even President Obama acknowledged the negative impact the emission regulations would have on small businesses and exempted them from meeting the increased standards when they were put in place. Marginal well operators play an important role in Oklahomas oil and natural gas industry and our states economy as a whole. Individually, marginal wells produce less than 10 barrels of oil per day, but as a collective, the marginal wells in Oklahoma account for roughly 15% of the states oil and natural gas production. By increasing the oil and natural gas industrys regulatory burden and costs, the federal government continues to jeopardize the foundation upon which Oklahomas economy is built. Faced with increasing costs that make marginally economic wells even less so, some producers will opt to shut down those wells, stopping the flow of oil and natural gas that powers Americas progress, eliminating the jobs associated with them and reducing the tax dollars paid on oil and natural gas production. It wont stop here. The regulatory onslaught will continue, and Oklahomas oil-and-gas-driven economy will pay the price. Elections have consequences. Brook A.

U.S. energy firms added oil and natural gas rigs this week, leading to a ninth straight monthly rig count increase, as a recovery in prices lured some drillers back to the well pad. Theoil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose two to 440 in the week to April 30, its highest since April 2020, Baker Hughes Co. said in its weekly report. That was the sixth time the count increased in the past seven weeks and put the total number up 32, or 8%, over this time last year. It was also up 80% since falling to a record low of 244 in August 2020, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1940. This week was the first time the current rig count rose over the year ago since April 2019 due in part to the massive 263 rig drop in the number of units operating in April 2020 when energy demand destruction from the coronavirus caused oil futures to turn negative. For the month, the total count rose 23 rigs, increasing for a ninth month in a row for the first time since July 2017. Oil rigs rose for an eighth straight month to their highest since April 2020. U.S. oil rigs fell one to 342 this week, while gas rigs rose two to 96, their highest since April 2020. U.S. crude futures were trading around $64 per barrel April 30, putting the contract on track to rise for a fifth time in the past six months. With prices mostly rising since November 2020, some energy firms plan to boost spending in 2021 after cutting drilling and completion expenditures over the past two years. That spending increase, however, remains small as most firms continue to focus on boosting cash flow, reducing debt and increasing shareholder returns rather than adding output. Exxon Mobil Corp.s capital spending fell to $3.1 billion in the first quarter, the lowest in nearly two decades. The top U.S. oil producer covered its spending and dividend with cash flow for the first time since the third quarter of 2018. Chevron Corp. said capital spending for the first quarter was $2.5 billion, down from $4.4 billion in the same period last year. The second-largest U.S. oil producer will restrain spending this year, including in shale. The stock markets are not sending a signal to us or our sector to increase capital, CFO Pierre Breber said. Crude oil output in the U.S. fell dropped by over a million barrels per day (MMbbl/d) in February, falling to 9.862 MMbbl/d, its lowest levels since October 2017, according to a monthly government report. Februarys data is the first time that oil production has dropped below 10 MMbbl/d since January 2018, according to the agency. The output drop came as a freeze in Texas shut in some production, but declines were also seen in other major oil-producing states. Monthly gross natural gas production in the U.S. Lower 48 states fell by 7.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), the biggest monthly decline on record, to 94.8 Bcf/d in February, the government said.",https://www.hartenergy.com/news/us-oil-rig-count-dips-gas-rig-count-inches-193855

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that.

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

Nickel extended its plunge from a six-year high after a stock-market slump hurt risk appetite, while copper resumed losses as supply concerns eased. Photographer: Bartek Sadowski/Bloomberg                        , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Major oil producers, for decades the natural resource industrys top earners, are being eclipsed by once-smaller mining peers who are churning out record profits thanks to red-hot metals markets. The mining windfall is the latest sign of a boom in iron ore, copper and other metals thats sending an inflationary wave through the global economy, increasing the cost of everything from electrical wires to construction beams. In the corporate world, the top five iron ore mining companies are on track to deliver bottom-line profits of $65 billion combined this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 13% more than the five biggest international oil producers, flipping a decades-old hierarchy. Its wild, said Mark Hansen, chief executive officer of London-based trading house Concord Resources Ltd. The value right now has shifted from energy to metals. The eye-watering mining profits are mainly a product of iron ore, the worlds biggest commodity after oil. The crucial steelmaking ingredient has been trading just a whisker below $200 a ton and on par with record prices from a decade ago, when voracious Chinese demand triggered what became known as the commodities supercycle. The largest Australian mining companies can pull a ton of iron ore from the ground for less than $20 a ton. Copper prices have also jumped near to all-time highs, crossing the $10,000-a-ton barrier for the first time in a decade. A basket of base metals including aluminum, nickel, copper, tin, lead and zinc is trading at levels only reached twice in modern history: in 2007-08 and 2011. For the big five iron ore miners -- BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA, Anglo American Plc and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. -- this fiscal year will be just the second time this century that theyll out-earn their oil peers, estimates show. It would be only the first time if their oil rivals hadnt been weighed down by huge writedowns in 2020. During the previous commodity boom, which peaked between 2008 and 2011, Big Oil easily made larger profits than Big Mining. A decade ago, for example, the five energy majors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc -- delivered adjusted earnings that were double those of the big five iron ore miners. Now, the surge in mining profits is another headache for the large oil companies as they struggle to attract shareholders amid mounting concern over climate change. While the miners are already returning more cash to investors, the oil producers are only just starting to do so, after some cut dividends last year. The miners also have a better story to tell: while oil contributes to a warming world, some metals -- particularly copper -- are key to building a greener future based on electric cars. Inflation Concerns The mining windfall matters beyond the natural resources industry. Its an indication that companies across multiple sectors will face rising costs, which at some point could translate into broader inflation, potentially hitting bond and foreign exchange markets. After a year of strong commodity-price increases, inflation pressures are now building downstream in supply chains, said John Mothersole, pricing and purchasing research director at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. So far, central banks -- notably the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have largely disregarded those pressures, saying theyre one-time price surges that are unlikely to start an inflationary problem. The Fed said April 28 that while inflation has risen, the increase largely reflects transitory factors. Iron ore is in a dream scenario: demand, especially from China, is rampant, while supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while industrial output is surging across the rest of the world as huge stimulus packages fuel a recovery from the pandemic. At the same time, producers are struggling to keep mines running at full capacity. Returning Cash Yet underpinning the tightness in metals is a strategic decision made by the big miners half a decade ago. After spending years pumping ever-expanding supply onto the global market, they ripped up growth plans and focused instead on shareholder returns. The result was that supply largely stopped rising and prices started to pick up. The good news for investors is that during this wave of high prices theyre likely to see more of the profits. Unlike in the last commodity supercycle, the miners -- still bruised from a series of disastrous deals and projects -- are reluctant to pour their extra earnings into acquisitions or new mines, instead choosing to distribute record dividends. That point was made clear by Vales CEO last week, after the Brazilian mining giant posted its best quarterly result since the high-point of the supercycle a decade ago. You shouldnt expect extreme spending, Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo said on Tuesday. There is nothing on our radar like that. And secondly -- the question that a lot of people make so Ill take the opportunity to make it clear -- there is no transformation and M&A on our radar as well. Big Oil is now doing the same, with companies from Exxon to BP abandoning oil output growth plans in an effort to regain shareholder trust: they have slashed spending on new projects, and after paying down debt, are promising to reward investors rather than develop new fields and refineries as they did during the previous cycle. Thats likely to result in lower oil supply later this decade, which in turn could support prices. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",http://bnnbloomberg.ca/record-metals-prices-catapult-mining-profits-beyond-big-oil-1.1597883

'We have revamped the traditional corrosion coupon and created a smart version that tells us more than just the corrosion rate, sa","Gulf Times)  Q atar Foundation Research, Development, and Innovation (QF RDI) along with several partners, has developed a smart version of corrosion coupon to understand more than just the corrosion rate of oil and gas pipelines. 'We have revamped the traditional corrosion coupon and created a smart version that tells us more than just the corrosion rate,"" said Dr Abitha Ramesh, corrosion researcher at Qatar Shell Research and Technology Centre (QSRTC), an anchor partner company of Qatar Science  &  Technology Park, part of QF RDI. The newly developed coupon incorporates three of the most commonly found deposits in sour gas pipelines and can also include an embedded sensor to monitor conditions beneath those deposits, she explained. A corrosion coupon is a small piece of metal, made of the same material type and grade as the pipeline. These coupons are retrieved from the pipeline at specific time intervals, cleaned and weighed. The difference in weight is used to calculate the average corrosion rate which in turn can be used to determine the integrity of the pipeline. These new corrosion coupons are manufactured in Qatar. The cost of manufacturing the first unit was equivalent to that of conventionally used coupons from the US. However, the cost is expected to go down considerably if they are mass-produced in Qatar. A conventional coupon cannot help in the complex scenario where UDC (under-deposit corrosion) occurs. In an effort to tackle one of the most prominent corrosion challenges in the oil and gas industry, a team of academic and industrial experts from QSRTC, Qatar University, Imperial College London teamed up to develop this innovative corrosion monitoring device through the financial support of QF's Qatar National Research Fund. The purpose of having these deposits on the newly developed coupon is to measure the local chemistry (chloride ions, potential drop and pH) under these deposits and to pick up early warning signs that UDC may be occurring. The role of the sensor is to identify potential problems even earlier by detecting local changes in chemistry that are a precursor to corrosion. 'These coupons are retracted every two months for detailed analysis, thereby allowing us to very closely follow changes associated with UDC and its most dangerous manifestation called pitting  a rapid and localised form of corrosion in which cavities or ""holes"" are produced in the material, explained, Dr Ramesh. The smart-coupons developed in this project are expected to make an immense contribution towards the early detection of UDC and pitting. In addition, the sensor in the coupon will be able to relay information in real-time as it detects changes in the local chemistry. Having an online sensor that can communicate this crucial information in real-time will contribute significantly towards maintaining safe operations. Dr Ramesh noted, 'Such early detection of pitting is very beneficial because when pitting starts the rate of pit propagation can be very fast and can have significant impact on the pipeline. The smart-coupons are currently being tested in the field. We deployed the coupons at Pearl GTL - a joint development by Qatar Petroleum and Shell in January this year; if things go as per plan, there is a real potential for these modified corrosion coupons to replace conventional coupons in the near future. 'Internal corrosion in pipelines, if not detected early, can affect the economics of production and processing, threaten lives and cause long-lasting environmental damage in case of failure. We can say with certainty that this novel UDC online sensor will play a significant role in ensuring the structural integrity of oil and gas pipelines not just in Qatar but also worldwide in locations with sour service pipelines, Dr Ramesh added.

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-16 23:00:00,The Market Bloodbath: A Boon for Oil and Gas -- The Motley Fool,Following Benjamin Graham's ideas is all that is required in this sector.,") Aug 22, 2011 at 12:00AM What made Benjamin Graham the investor that he was? For him, the intelligent investor was a realist who sold to optimists and bought from pessimists. That opportunity beckons us now! The market tanked once again on Thursday and Friday. And not surprisingly, the oil and gas industry saw a massive sell-off. But as Foolish colleague Morgan Housel noted, the best returns are made during the darkest days There does not seem to be any reason to disagree. And of course, this is where I'm sniffing opportunity. Companies operating in the exploration and production space saw some of the biggest hits. Fears of another recession caused crude prices to plunge, taking these stocks along with them. Still, this is not entirely surprising with investor emotion running pretty high for the last two weeks. But this is where Fools should capitalize. Should we worry? Yet, is there anything fundamentally wrong with these companies? I don't think so. In fact, while oil prices have seen a drop, production has been increasing steadily. And why is that? Because the companies know for sure that they will sell whatever they drill. The perfect example here is Anadarko Petroleum, which fell 8%. Record production levels have seen the company register substantial growthin the last quarter. In other words, it's simple economics here. Demand for oil and gas has been growing by the day and it will keep growing. The promising stars The shale play operators have all seen a massive drop in share prices. Companies operating in the Bakken shale have been the worst hit. Continental Resources (NYSE: CLR) saw a fantastic fall by 10%, followed by Brigham Exploration (Nasdaq: BEXP) by 9.5% and Kodiak Oil & Gas (NYSE: KOG) by 8.3%. And these are the three stocks whose long-term outlook has been extremely positive. Kodiak has been very strong in terms of production,which has translated into phenomenal earnings growth. A fall in price realizations should not be a major hindrance for this company. And the same holds for Continental and Brigham. The former, being one of the major players in the region, has seen almost 25% shaved off from its share price in the last three weeks. The Eagle Ford players have witnessed another substantial sell-off. EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG)",https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/08/22/the-market-bloodbath-a-boon-for-oil-and-gas.aspx
fool,NotProvided,2021-04-16 23:00:00,Kodiak Oil & Gas' Year in Review -- The Motley Fool,A look back at a strong year for the Denver oil and gas outfit.,"Dec 15, 2011 at 12:00AM At the end of 2010, Kodiak Oil & Gas (NYSE: KOG) put forth its 2011 capital spending plan for the coming year. At $200 million, it was the largest projected investment in the company's history. Kodiak planned to drill 28 gross wells and complete 26 gross wells in the Bakken and Three Forks oil plays in North Dakota. The company expected to average 5,000 to 6,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, finishing the year at a production rate of 9,000 BOE/D. Let's see how things shaped up. North Dakota winter Despite inclement weather, road closures, and flooding, Kodiak charged out of the gate in the first quarter, posting sales 133% higher than the same quarter the year before. It reported a net loss, however, because of $9.3 million in derivatives losses. Kodiak also increased its capital expenditure budget to $220 million to compensate for adding another drilling rig into the field and for acreage acquisition. Mother Nature's reckoning Halfway through the year, Kodiak announced that it no longer expected to average 5,000 to 6,500 BOE/D because of a tough winter in the Bakken. The company reduced its outlook to 4,500 to 5,000 BOE/D, but maintained its goal of achieving 9,000 BOE/D by the end of the year. Its capital expenditure budget was bumped to $230 million. Expected well counts also rose to 42 gross wells. The acquisition At the end of June, Kodiak announced it had closed on an $85.5 million leasehold and assets acquisition in the Williston Basin of the Bakken play. Funding the purchase through cash and borrowings, the company boosted its total Bakken acreage to 100,000 net acres. As a result of the acquisition -- and with sales from the second quarter coming in higher than expected -- the company opted to increase its borrowing power, from $75 million to $110 million for its first lien senior secured revolving credit facility, and from $40 million to $55 million for its second lien term loan. It takes money to make money. It was a very good year By the middle of 2011, it was clear that Kodiak was having a strong year. Oil and gas sales broke company records, net income was up -- even in the face of derivatives losses -- and production was on pace to meet the company's end-of-year goals. Specifically, the company was operating five rigs and production was humming right along, reaching 7,500 to 8,000 BOE per day, and positioning the company well to hit its target of 9,000 BOE/D. Sky's the limit Apparently, merely achieving its goals were not enough. The company raised $650 million in a private offeringand picked up 50,000 more acres in the Bakken bringing its total to more than 150,000 net acres and completely changing future production outlooks. Kodiak now expects to finish the year at 17,000 BOE/D, with numbers expected to hit 30,000 BOE/D by the end of next year. 2011 was a year of tremendous growth for Kodiak. The company tripled in size, added acreage, and managed to post excellent results despite dealing with some unpredictable hardships of the Bakken climate for much of the beginning of the year.

oilandgas360,NotProvided,2021-04-16 22:30:36,EXCLUSIVE Nigeria refines energy reform bill to attract more Big Oil cash,"The latest oil and gas news, dedicated to all things oil and gas: people, technologies, transactions, trends, and macro-economic analysis that impact commodity prices.","Nigeria has sweetened the terms of a sweeping oil reform bill in a bid to attract much-needed investment to its oil industry, four people closely involved with the legislation said and a letter from oil companies, seen by Reuters, showed. Source: Reuters The proposed changes signal a shift by Africas largest oil producer and show the impact of an increasingly competitive environment in the energy business after 2020s global oil price collapse and an expected shift to renewables. Nigeria in 2019 had fast-tracked a law to boost its take of offshore oil revenue, a move industry experts said at the time could put billions of dollars of offshore oil investments at risk. Now Nigeria has changed its stance in an attempt to balance its immediate revenue demands with the need to lock-in long-term investment for its oil industry. The reform bill has been in the works for two decades, but the contentious nature of changes to Nigerias oil sector, which provides 90% of foreign exchange and nearly half the national budget, have scuppered previous versions. In January, a fist fight broke out between local community leaders during one of the public hearings on the bill. But with political alignment between President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly, the measure is expected to pass this year, though likely not before late May, the people said. Key changes to the bill would lower the royalties for new production from deepwater oilfields to 5% from 7.5% and boost the production level that triggers higher royalties from 15,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 50,000 bpd. For onshore and shallow water oilfields, it would reduce the hydrocarbon tax to 30% for converted leases, down from 42.5% in the original bill. The changes would also guarantee that state oil company NNPCs assets and liabilities would transfer to a limited liability corporation. This will help oil companies to collect money owed by NNPC. The Ministry of Petroleum declined to comment. NNPC did not respond to a request for comment. In the letter seen by Reuters, oil industry executives pushed for more changes, particularly around gas development and fiscal term stability which provides assurance that there will not be any unexpected changes in the royalties and tax regime. The executives said that terms are not sufficiently competitive to stimulate the desired new investments. Oil companies have noted that Nigeria got just 4% of the $70 billion invested in sanctioned projects in Africa between 2015 and 2019. NEED TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT Last year, oil industry analysts Wood Mackenzie had said Nigerias oil output could fall sharply without reforms. Gail Anderson, research director with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said of the changes to the bill: It shows that (the government) listened. They recognise the need to attract investment, not just in the Nigerian context but globally in the energy transition, Anderson said. The competition is going to be more intense, and this is a move in the right direction to attain and attract investment. But Anderson also said that not all the gas terms in the bill were good enough to spur development, which Nigeria has said it wants for its decade of gas. President Buhari originally sent the bill to the National Assembly in September. The legislative body has held two public hearings, but there have been a series of private consultations with stakeholders, including oil companies and community leaders that culminated in dozens of amendments. Legislators worked over the Easter holidays to consider the amendments, which the executive submitted in March. One proposed change, which would have instituted a mandatory review of fiscal terms every seven years, was removed after a backlash from companies concerned about stability of terms for projects with decades-long investment cycles.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/exclusive-nigeria-refines-energy-reform-bill-to-attract-more-big-oil-cash/

Show more Credit: Polytechnic University of Saint Petersburg, Peter the Great Underground pipelines that transport oil and gas are very important for engineering communications around the world. Some of these underground communications are built and operated in earthquake-prone areas. The study of seismic safety or the seismic stability of underground pipelines has been an extensive study since the 1950s. Since then, a number of methodologies have been proposed to calculate the stress that an underground pipeline receives during an earthquake. The purpose of these methodologies was to make an accurate prediction about the structural stress that the pipeline receives during an earthquake, and thus will allow the determination of the pipelines elasticity in the first place. It is important to find a correct balance between pipeline cost and structural flexibility. Turns out we were wrong. New research was conducted by scientists from the Institute of Mechanics and Seismic Stability of Installations Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan and Peter the Great Saint Petersburg University of Applied Arts (SPbPU) in Russia. The research showed that the current methods used to calculate the stress received by underground pipelines during an earthquake are incorrect. Current methods do not take into account seismic pressure, that is, the natural pressure at the outside of the pipeline caused by propagation of a seismic wave into the soil. This leads to an incorrect determination of the pipeline pressure; longitudinal stress calculations lead to errors of 100% or more, he said Nikolai Vatin, Professor at the Institute of Civil Engineering, SPbPU. Ignoring linear pressure means that all underground oil and gas pipelines are more vulnerable to earthquakes than initially expected. Researchers have developed a new theory for the propagation of seismic waves in an underground pipeline and surrounding soil to address this problem. The related theoretical material explaining all the mathematical calculations of the new theory and its benefits compared to the previous methodology can be found in the article Wave theory of seismic resistance of underground pipelines. It is really impressive that science is moving forward, we get better theories and find our mistakes. However, the sinister worry is that all of our existing pipelines are at risk will remain for some time until they are replaced and modernized, said Karim Sultanov of the Institute of Mechanics and Seismic Stability.

rigzone,NotProvided,2021-04-16 12:38:38,A New Use for Orphaned Oil and Gas Wells? |Rigzone,It's an alternative to P&A for some idle wells that could still create work for oil and gas pros.,"Tweet It's an alternative to P&A for some idle wells that could still create work for oil and gas pros. How best to reduce the massive backlog of idle oil and gas wells with unknown or insolvent operators, better known as orphan oil and gas wells, has been a prominent topic in the United States lately. The Biden administration, for instance, has proposed spending $16 billion on plugging and abandonment (P&A) activities via its broader, multitrillion-dollar infrastructure program. Others, notably the Texas Well Protected Energy Foundation profiled recently in Rigzone are calling for shifting responsibility for P&A from government to the nonprofit realm. More recently, Petrolern LLC  an Atlanta-based service and technology firm specializing in subsurface engineering and downhole tools  has advanced another idea: repurpose some of the orphaned oil and gas wells to produce geothermal energy. The company has developed a system called ConvertDeck that it maintains efficiently evaluates large numbers of orphaned wells to determine which are likely good candidates for geothermal conversion. Geothermal energy has up to now been a small contributor to U.S. and global energy, Alan J. Cohen, technology partnerships director with Petrolern, told Rigzone, adding the resource has primarily been exploited in high-temperature volcanic belts in certain regions of the globe. Drilling new geothermal wells is very expensive and can be up to 50% of the total project cost. Repurposing lower-temperature oil industry wells in sedimentary formations provides a valuable new source of geothermal energy. Cohen pointed out that sample conversion project proposals for various Petrolern clients show geothermal electricity costs below 4 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), adding that such projects can yield internal rates of return exceeding 10 percent as well as six-digit job creation. Moreover, he pointed out that wells converted to geothermal service release zero emissions. The system is entirely closed, he said. Cohen, along with two of his colleagues at Petrolern, shared additional details about the prospect of producing geothermal energy from orphaned oil and gas wells. Read on for their insights. Rigzone: Briefly, please explain what ConvertDeck is and how the system works. Alan J. Cohen: ConvertDeck is a patented, unique, expert system-based screening tool to select appropriate late-stage or unplugged/abandoned oil industrywells to convert them to profitable geothermal electricity or heat. It is a multi-faceted approach that integratesgeology, reservoir, wellbore, surface power plant, infrastructure, environmental, and economic criteria and how they are all connected and makes expertrecommendations for field conversion of the wells for use in geothermal power, heating, or cooling applications.  Rigzone: What makes an orphan oil and gas well a good candidate to become a geothermal well? Cohen: Petrolerns approach requires a good response in the several categories listed, essentially the right reservoir or aquifer and well bore conditions, proximity to electricity or heat markets, and with good economics. It is noted that blind selection of orphan wells for conversion may result in significant capital losses. A major value proposition of ConvertDeck, therefore, is de-risking conversion projects. Rigzone: With orphan wells, the operator is either unknown or insolvent. In the case of converting an orphaned oil and gas well to geothermal, who would operate the geothermal wells and how would operatorship be established? Cohen: Ownership issues are now under discussion with regulatory agencies in several states, so we dont wish to pre-empt these discussions. Rigzone: What are the steps necessary to convert an orphaned oil and gas well to geothermal service? Hamed Soroush, CEO, Petrolern: Well preparation Engineering the system if needed, includingexamining various aquifersand target zones in the well. and not simply the original producing zone. Perforations or recompletions may be needed. Installation of surface facility  the wellhead power plant Dispatch to the end users, and all the usual project administrative and contracting work for the wells, power plant, construction, financing, and power sales. The inaugural projects will use modular power systems with about 100 kilowatts of gross power. Later projects will involve larger power plants  5 megawatts or bigger. Rigzone: What sort of workers would be needed for this, and could people with oil and gas skill sets easily transfer their skills to geothermal well conversions? Soroush: Geologists, geophysicists, geomechanics engineers, reservoir engineers, well and completion engineers, chemical engineers, mechanical and electrical engineers. Oil and gas skills can definitely translate over and add significant value. Blue-collar workers would be especially needed on workover rigs, pump rigs, piping construction, and power plant operations and maintenance. We estimate that our approach can create up to 200,000 jobs, many of them redeploying oil and gas workers. Rigzone: How would energy from geothermal wells reach the electrical grid? Kevin Kitz, Power Systems Advisor, Petrolern: There are multiple options on how to monetize the thermal energy from converted wells. The most obvious is to put the power on the grid, which requires some type of power purchase agreement. But it may be more valuable to ship the power on privately owned power lines to a facility that can use it to serve house load. This could include other oil and gas operators, including displacing gas-fired compression, or larger industrial customers with a relatively steady power requirement. It is also possible, especially in colder climates, to ship geothermal heat instead of geothermal power. One of the first screening steps of ConvertDeck is to assess potential markets. If a low-temperature well is 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the nearest power line, that is not going to be a good candidate for conversion. Petrolern also has the expertise to identify the potential markets and to negotiate the contracts for that energy delivery. Rigzone: How does 4 cents per kWh for geothermal electricity  after deducting well-abandonment costs  compare to other electricity sources such as natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar? Cohen: We can achieve under 4 cents without subtracting well abandonment costs. When well abandonment is accounted for, we can in principle get close to 2 cents per kWh on some projects. That compares well with other electricity sources, especially when one considers that  except for periodic maintenance  the geothermal electricity is always on, whereas, solar and wind operate largely only at limited times during the day. Solar-generated electricity, for example, currently averages about 5 cents per kWh, and the U.S. Department of Energy has targeted it to reach 2 cents per kWh by 2030. We are already there on some of our geothermal projects. Geothermal also brings a lot of benefits, including more jo",https://www.rigzone.com/news/a_new_use_for_orphaned_oil_and_gas_wells-16-apr-2021-165182-article/
fool,NotProvided,2021-04-16 09:03:00,Halcon Resources Corp: Management Potential Can't Overcome High Debt Load -- The Motley Fool,"Lofty valuations and debt levels caused investors to overpay for Halcon Resources, which only now near 52-week lows trades at comparable valuations to competitors like Kodiak Oil & Gas and Oasis Petroleum.","NYSE:OAS ) . These equally or larger sized producers have smaller debt loads and possibly better financial flexibility to grow production and reserves gong forward. Investors will watch these numbers very closely when the company reports. 2014 capital spending program Recently, Halcon Resources lowered its drilling and completions budget for 2014 by 14% to approximately $950 million. The reduced spending is not suppose to impact production guidance of 38,000 to 42,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or boe/d. The key, though, to investors is that the funding for growth comes from increased borrowings and the sale of more non-core assets. These additional sales will come on top of selling $300 million worth of assets that amounted to 21.2 million boe worth of proved reserves. Those assets produced 4,500 boe/d. Now the company is discussing unloading another $300 to $400 million worth of assets in 2014. On the flip side, Oasis Petroleum sits at multi-year highs. The energy producer focused on the North Dakota's Bakken shale forecasts growing production to 46,000 to 50,000 boe/d this year. The production forecast is for 40% growth along with an equivalent bump in capital spending to $1.43 billion. At the midpoint of 2014 guidance, Oasis will only produce 20% more boe/d than Halcon, but the much higher capital spending due to a better capital structure sets up the company for better growth in 2015 and beyond. Having a slightly higher enterprise value, Kodiak predicts full-year 2014 guidance of 42,000 to 44,000 boe/d after averaging 29,200 boe/d in the prior year. The company guided toward a 2014 capital spending program of roughly the same $1 billion that it spent in last year. Proved reserves Another major focus will be the proved reserves that Halcon ended with at the end of 2013. Based on divestitures, Halcon sits at around 85 million boe. Oasis Petroleum reported a 59% increase in proved reserves at the end of 2013 to reach 228 million boe. Importantly, 87% of estimated net proved reserves consist of oil. Kodiak saw proved reserves jump 77% to 167 million boe. The mix for Kodiak is roughly 83% oil. Bottom line Over the last couple of years, investors in Halcon have learned the difficult lesson that exceptional management teams can't overcome excessive valuations and high debt levels. Unless, Halcon Resources can generate a significantly larger growth in proven reserves, the stock trades at a similar enterprise value ratio to annual production forecasts to both Oasis Petroleum and Kodiak. Investors that overpaid for the stock in the past will probably not see a solid rebound in the stock unless the sector gains as a whole. If anything the smaller debt loads of Oasis and Kodiak probably leave those stocks with less risk for investors if oil prices were to plunge. So far management hasn't proven any exceptional ability to grow production and reserves faster than other comparable stocks so investors need to be careful paying a premium price.

Within the initiative, $1 trillion is earmarked for green projects, including renewable energy and clean technologies that are focused on speeding the transition to a low-carbon economy. Source: CNBC The $2.5 trillion target, which begins this year and runs through the end of 2030, will also finance and facilitate transactions that support socioeconomic progress in developing countries, as well as economic inclusion in developed markets. The latter effort will focus on small business financing, home lending and affordable housing, education and health care. Included within this category is the $30 billion JPMorgan committed last October to closing the racial wealth gap in the U.S. Climate change and inequality are two of the critical issues of our time, and these new efforts will help create sustainable economic development that leads to a greener planet and critical investments in underserved communities, CEO Jamie Dimon said. Business, government and policy leaders must work together to support long-term solutions that advance economic inclusion, bolster sustainable development and further the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are committed to doing our part, he said. Thursdays announcement comes after JPMorgan said last fall it will establish emission targets for its financing portfolio . The firm said targets would be set on a sector-by-sector basis, and will first focus on the oil and gas, electric power, and automotive manufacturing sectors. The targets, which the firm said it would begin setting in 2021, will be within the parameters outlined by the 2015 Paris Agreement. Dimon also addressed the enormous opportunity created by the energy transition in his . Theres huge opportunity in sustainable and low-carbon technologies and businesses, he said. While many of these technologies and companies are mature, many more are just getting startedand more will need to be created in the coming decades. In addition, all companies will need capital and advice to help them innovate, evolve and become more efficient while staying competitive in a changing world, Dimon said in the letter. The bank facilitated in 2020 more than $220 billion in transactions related to sustainable development, more than $55 billion of which was for green initiatives.

Source: Reuters Brents six-month calendar spread remains in a steep backwardation, implying traders expect the market to remain somewhat tight, with continued downward pressure on global inventories, in the second half of the year. OECD commercial petroleum inventories have fallen back in line with the pre-epidemic five-year average, according to estimates prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( https://tmsnrt.rs/3gdVk8k ). But front-month Brent prices have been broadly stable since mid-February, implying traders also expect OPEC+ to raise production enough to offset rebounding consumption, ensuring the market does not tighten further. Brents six-month spread is trading in a backwardation of $2.50 per barrel (the 82nd percentile for all trading days since 1990), down from $4.20 (96th percentile) on March 5. But the front-month futures price has increased just 4% over the last two months (58th percentile), down from a 24% increase (96th percentile) in the two months to March 5. Prices appear to have reached a temporary peak after rallying strongly for more than three months between the start of November and the middle of February. MARKET SHARING The oil market is likely to remain adequately supplied for the remainder of the year if prices stay around $65 per barrel, which would be very close to the long-term average over the last two or three decades in real terms. Prices at this level would continue to encourage a modest increase in drilling by shale firms and a rise in production through the rest of 2021 and into early 2022. But U.S. output increases would likely remain gradual and should be absorbed by the return of consumption as the epidemic passes and travel controls are relaxed, posing little threat to the market share of OPEC+. If prices rise much above this level, the production response from the shale sector is likely to accelerate, posing a threat to OPEC+ share, something the group appears keen to avoid. Iran, not currently subject to the OPEC+ production limits because it is under U.S. sanctions, has already been adding extra barrels to the market since the start of the year through covert sales to refiners in China. Rising covert exports helped ensure the market remained well-supplied during the first quarter, offseting some of the production restraint by the other members of the group. Provided restrictions on passenger aviation are gradually eased in the second half of the year, there should be enough consumption growth to absorb increases from U.S. shale, Iran and the rest of OPEC+. However, that delicate equilibrium depends on travel curbs being substantially eased in the next six months, and prices remaining close to current levels so as not to kindle a third shale boom.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/column-oil-prices-find-new-equilibrium-kemp/

Source; Reuters In a report outlining a scenario where the world acts decisively to tackle greenhouse gas emissions by electrifying transport and industry, Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie said oil consumption would begin a steep drop as early as in 2023. The decline in demand would accelerate to a rate of 2 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) to reach 35 million bpd by 2050, accounting for a 60% drop in carbon emissions from oil use from todays levels. Oil consumption hit a record of around 100 million bpd in 2019 and is expected to recover strongly this year after cratering last year due to the coronavirus epidemic. As a result, oil prices would begin to slip later this decade, WoodMac said in its report. Under its Accelerated Energy Transition scenario, it expects Brent crude prices to average $40 per barrel by 2030, compared with current prices of around $65 a barrel. By 2050, Brent may slide to $10 to $18 a barrel. (Graphic: WoodMacs oil price forecast  ) If we move to keep global warming to the 2 degrees Celsius limit set by the (U.N.-backed) Paris Agreement, the energy matrix will change  and change profoundly, said WoodMacs Ann-Louise Hittle. The worlds current policies are nevertheless far from aligned with the Paris agreement, with temperatures currently on course to rise by 3 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100, WoodMac stressed. A rapid decline in demand also means that existing sources of oil supplies would be sufficient to meet all future demand, with only limited need for new oifield developments, WoodMac said. A sharp fall in oil demand and prices in the coming decades would have a profound impact on major oil producers such as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, WoodMac said. The steep fall in demand prevents those key oil producers from managing the market and supporting prices in the way it does today. Despite losing their price-setting ability, however, low-cost Middle East OPEC producers remain core providers of oil. Natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, would, however, fare better than oil by replacing coal for power generation, particularly in fast-growing Asian economies, the report added. As oil prices declined, gas would eventually trade at a premium to oil under WoodMacs scenario. Benchmark U.S. Henry Hub prices are forecast to trade at $3 to $4 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) under WoodMacs scenario. Gas demand in Asia would increase on average by 1.5% a year through to 2050, offsetting declines in more mature markets, which would be switching to renewables from gas.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/oil-to-hit-40-by-2030-if-climate-goals-are-met-consultancy/

Source: Reuters It was also the first time that a ship has been refuelled with biofuel in Singapore, the worlds largest bunkering hub. A biofuel blend derived from certified sustainable feedstock sources such as cooking oil, crude tall oil and sewage sludge was used on April 4 to refuel the 81,000 deadweight tonne dry bulk carrier Kira Oldendorff which was on its way from Australia to Europe. The blend required no significant modifications to the engine or other components, a BHP spokesman said. The mining giant is exploring the use of bunker fuels such as liquefied natural gas and biofuels to replace fuel oil, aiming to reduce carbon emissions by 40% when shipping its products as part of the companys climate change goals for 2030. The biofuel blend used is said to reduce well-to-exhaust CO2 emissions by 80% to 90% compared with conventional residual fuel oils, BHP said in a statement. The spokesman said enough was loaded to trial the biofuel over a number of days, a significant portion of the vessels voyage. He declined to comment on the price of the biofuel, citing a confidentiality agreement. The shipping industry is examining a range of technologies as it looks to meet an International Maritime Organization target of a 50% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 levels by 2050. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie says global demand for oil-based marine fuels is set to fall in the next three decades as stricter carbon emissions rules for the shipping industry kick in and alternative fuel use climbs. The biofuel was supplied by Netherlands-based GoodFuels in partnership with German shipping group Oldendorff Carriers and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. This trial marks the start of a process for GoodFuels of facilitating more structural supply of sustainable marine biofuels in Singapore, in a commercial, operational and technically feasible manner, Isabel Welten, chief commercial officer at GoodFuels, said in the statement.",https://www.oilandgas360.com/bhp-completes-its-first-refuelling-of-a-ship-with-biofuel/

fool,NotProvided,2021-04-15 23:00:00,5 Oil and Gas Companies That Pay Monthly Dividends -- The Motley Fool,Finding a monthly dividend payer provides flexibility to grow your portfolio or meet monthly obligations.,"Source: Yahoo! Finance. What's a royalty trust? A royalty trust is similar to a REIT but income is derived from oil and gas rights instead of real estate or mortgages. As long as the trust pays out 90% of earnings as distributions to shareholders, the trust can avoid corporate income taxes. With this special treatment, however, comes special tax reporting requirements, so be aware of that prior to purchasing royalty trusts. Their assets also deplete over time, so the income is not guaranteed to last beyond the life of the trust, and in some cases, shares become completely worthless when the trust ends. That said, Enduro Royalty Trust is brand-new, offered to investors in November 2011. Ownership provides the opportunity to share in the profits of oil and natural gas production from the trust's properties in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. San Juan Basin Royalty Trust is the largest U.S. royalty trust, also benefiting from production in New Mexico. Finally, Permian Basin Royalty Trust provides investors with a share of income from two properties in Texas. Two Canadian options Both Baytex Energy and Provident Energy are set up similar to the royalty trusts mentioned above. One difference is that they are based in Canada, but they also produce some of the oil and gas they sell. This is different from the U.S.-based royalty trusts, which are usually set up by banks solely to distribute the proceeds from other producers. Baytex Energy engages in the acquisition, development, and production of oil and natural gas in Western Canada and North Dakota. Formerly a trust, it acquired assets the past few years that led to it becoming more active in the actual production of oil and natural gas. Provident Energy has assets focused on three of the most important North American energy plays: the Alberta oil sands, the Bakken shale, and the Marcellus shale. Because of this, Pembina Pipeline announced its plan to purchasethe Canadian energy company last month. Dividends are great Though these aren't dividend payers in the traditional sense, their monthly dividend-like distributions could be used to pay some monthly expenses. In addition, they are a nice way to get some exposure to oil and natural gas in a world defined by fossil fuels.

In 2017, President Trump issued an executive order to reverse President Obamas protection of those waters from oil and gas development, a decision Obama was authorized to make under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). Trumps order was struck down in 2019 by a federal judge in Alaska, after the League of Conservation Voters challenged the order in court. The Trump administration appealed that decision. The appeal would have examined the legality under the OCSLA of a president terminating a predecessors withdrawal of specified federal offshore areas from oil and gas development. The OCSLA is not explicit on this possibility. The appeals court confirmed that Bidens executive order on this topic  issued on the presidents first day in office, on January 20, 2021  meant there were no grounds for an appeal; the new executive order revoking President Trumps order removed the basis of the legal controversy, leaving President Obamas restrictions in place.
